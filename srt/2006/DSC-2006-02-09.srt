1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Deltasy are a Charlie, triple three.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
People of Earth, your attention please.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
By playing this audio feedback in the program that you call, cast Blaster, you have unlocked

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the secret subliminal message.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh yes, Adam has totally sold out.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We are using every trick in the book to get you to sign up to...

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That link.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Over $16 million worth of airplanes trapped to my ass.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hey, once you waste a Wednesday with me.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes, coming to you from the Curry Cottage in the...

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Affluent suburb of Surrey and Gilford.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's a Deltasy source code.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Come along, Blaster.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The low to ever make it back on deck.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm a spec between the timbers up a foolish ship.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Ride a river, zulf a loss of feet.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And pour the crop out of any bomb.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Dumb enough to listen to me.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The courtroom's the place for this face.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Ticking the stand, looking my hand.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We'll never before have a bad, bad attention.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Or maybe just a one spot, the guy with some strange stare.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He never showed a long, like terror.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If he didn't want the admirer to have been made,

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I went into the bench.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I guess my best defense was the sufferin' silence.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I never find the words when I'm confrontin' violence.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And anyway, do you know anyone who thinks that fast?

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
When they know the next words gonna be their last.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So don't consume what regret.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
My beautiful face is intact yet.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I said, I need you to like me.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I like you didn't find me.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I need you to like me.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I like you didn't find me.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I need you to like me.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I like you didn't find me.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Said I need you to like me.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I like you didn't find me.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
When I was the time, I was drinking in the fire.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The music on the box sent me, well, higher.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And if you need to have a song that goes along with the rhymes or the time

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
that it let my fires.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't know what I was thinking.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I was just playing on the drums when the shoot I've been drinking.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But the kit was in my head to see I'm playing on my knees.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I have fingers for sticks and I knew all the beats fit.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Well, then I went to hit my crash.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I played a perfect smash.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I accidentally punched the glass fly through the air.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Dumb's beer in the hair.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All the poor dumb soul who'd never played a role in my life before.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But he was up for one now confronting the on the floor.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I said, sorry.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
All I wanted was to hit my symbol.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Big mistake.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Because I'm the Richard Kimball.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But I became a fugitive from the future temp.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Who was running after me with murder on his mind.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He looked just fine when he was away behind.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, let he come and got it.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He only showed me.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I said, I need you to like me.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I like you didn't find me.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I need you to like me.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I like you didn't find me.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I need you to like me.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'd like if you didn't find me.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I need you to like me.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'd like if you didn't find me.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm going up.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I know it's too empty.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But I'm getting so much winter.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The lady in my head just said it's nice to see her.

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So many people talking with the same boy saying it's so good to be here.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's too dark and clear.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I grabbed a pad and went again.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
They urged to create.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Well, too late.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I realized that the drugs on the page dilate.

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Until a big bad image is lying in big dead state.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's too bad.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's too frustrating.

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
My desire for an outside, but I don't control.

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But I'm on the end.

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm by road to patrol.

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The worst kind of sign-ups.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Bring it up.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I remember I had about our relaps.

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But all the people in my life were the one same control freak.

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Ha ha.

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Like me.

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm each unique.

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Every day of the week I sneak to the doors.

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Just a barrel of fire that you like me.

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Sweat it out.

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Like me.

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Like you didn't fire me.

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I need you to like me.

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I like you didn't fire me.

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I need you to like me.

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I like you didn't fire me.

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I need you to like me.

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh.

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I get go three.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Two f-u.

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I quite sure what it was.

109
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But that popped up on the homepage of the podcast of music network this morning.

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And I checked it out and listened to it.

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And I was like, yeah, something going on with that.

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
From Edinburgh is get go three.

113
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Just looking at their page here on the PMN influences James Brown,

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
fun love and crimson and manic orchestra.

115
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
As I said from Edinburgh.

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And they've been around for a while.

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's from their second EP titled Menton.

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You can find that at music.podshow.com.

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Of course, in the show notes on today's podcast.

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Sound should be a little bit better today.

121
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yesterday, without me knowing it, my creative lab sound card decided to

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
revert back to headphones.

123
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Why in the world headphones has to sound so shitty coming from their sound card is

124
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
behind me.

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And I figured out what's happening.

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There's a little check box in the.

127
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
My god.

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It couldn't be a different more difficult.

129
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
There's a little check box in the control pan.

130
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The control panel for the creative labs.

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Sound blaster card, which you have to find somewhere through navigating through the start menu.

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And it's a check by default, which means it's synchronized with the control panel.

133
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I guess that's the sound control panel.

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I really don't know what it is.

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But I unchecked it.

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Then I had to reboot and then it finally worked.

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
On top of all that, a cast blaster mic sent me a new version of cast blaster.

138
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What do you have to know?

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Beta 58.

140
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
My god, man.

141
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It just keeps on coming.

142
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So some of those issues we saw yesterday will probably this unbelievable the stuff he's got in here.

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
If you don't mind me just falling over this for a second.

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
There's a diagnostics tab under Configure and it shows it says show audio diagnostics.

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And I look at it.

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It shows a log of what I play.

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Then it's showing my buffer size as in God knows what.

148
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But anyway, if something goes wrong, it's supposed to send the output of that file to mic.

149
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So hopefully everything will go good.

150
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Go good.

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Go well.

152
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Lots to talk about today.

153
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm talking feedback.

154
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Not a lot about the cartoon controversy.

155
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yeah.

156
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
See, I'm trying to do a Madonna now.

157
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The cartoon controversy.

158
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But there's lots of stuff about advertising and some good news about for Apple, Apple owners.

159
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And Matthew Gauer.

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Complained.

161
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So let's start off with the complaint then.

162
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I must say the increased usage of advertising within your podcast is making me seriously

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Consider dropping my subscription to Delta Sierra Charlie.

164
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Number one reason I listen to podcasts is to avoid the overwhelming saturation of advertising

165
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
in today's radio stations.

166
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I find it extremely frustrating to scan radio channels knowing that each channel will have a greater

167
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
chance of playing an advertisement than playing content.

168
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Well, DSC certainly isn't yet at that level of saturation.

169
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I finally remember your first podcast where no advertising was used.

170
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I fully understand what a means of support is needed for podcasts.

171
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But advertisements certainly are not the root to travel.

172
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I find it interesting that you spend the significant amount of time within your podcast

173
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
denigrating the current commercial media institutions.

174
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Well, actively emulating their business model via advertisements.

175
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I believe that the satellite radio stations have a superior model, a simple subscription

176
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and no advertising.

177
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
A flat rate subscription allowing unlimited podcast subscription will be far less offensive.

178
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Of course, just my opinion.

179
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Thanks for listening.

180
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Matt.

181
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So first of all, Matt unsubscribe if you must.

182
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We're sorry to see you go.

183
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The second part is, you know, the daily source code is a podcast about really about podcasting.

184
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It always has been that's how it started more from a technology standpoint.

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And this is where we get to try stuff out.

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This is where we try out stuff like sound seeing.

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And indeed, the sound advertising.

188
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Do it using Vulcan mind tricks to see if we can link in a brand to a sound on the show.

189
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We talk about user generated advertisements.

190
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
All kinds of stuff.

191
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's appropriate for my podcast.

192
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I feel.

193
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And if you don't like it, then it's not the right podcast for you.

194
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
By the way, most people check into the source code and leave after a while, you know, after hearing

195
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
hopefully after hearing a promo.

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And I hope that they will replace the time to listen to this podcast with something else that is more

197
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
suited towards what they want.

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And of course, the advertisements and other podcasts, if there are advertisements, should

199
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
be suitable for that audience.

200
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So I think that the audience is listening here knows that we mess around with all kinds of

201
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
stuff and test stuff out.

202
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And boy, I'm not afraid to let people know what the feedback is on all of that.

203
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
We've slammed me.

204
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
We've slammed pod show.

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We've slammed our advertisers.

206
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
All kinds of stuff.

207
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And by the way, on a personal level, if every single one of my subscribers would pay me a buck

208
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
a month, yeah, that would be nice.

209
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'd go for that.

210
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Sadly, it also has advertising.

211
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Make no mistake.

212
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I believe if it's not already happening, I've been in the UK for a couple of weeks.

213
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Stern will be running advertising on that serious.

214
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And satellite actually satellite radio has a tremendous advantage.

215
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And the advantage is not over content or distribution.

216
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Well, actually it is.

217
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's over distribution of the player, the reception device.

218
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So we have, let's say we have iTunes right now.

219
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And every single new automobile in the United States that's rolling off the assembly line

220
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
has either a serious, hopefully a serious, or some others.

221
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm going to mention it.

222
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Or an XM receiver built right in.

223
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And that's really what the whole race is about.

224
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's, you know, who's got GM, who's got a damler Chrysler.

225
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And these things will be built in standard.

226
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The subscription fee, well, if it's not already being done,

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
will be built right into your monthly lease or right into, you know, something or

228
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
some other form of a payment.

229
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So you really won't notice it.

230
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And, you know, that's really where they have a tremendous advantage.

231
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And in podcasting, we do have a lot of work to do because make no mistake.

232
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You're seeing iTunes is really flooding up now with all kinds of mainstream content,

233
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
particularly video content.

234
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But, you know, just look, it's mainly public radio on that's being promoted on the home page.

235
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Of course, the pod finder gets up there, which we're very appreciative of.

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
They've got to cut a new one, by the way, this week.

237
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You know, so we, we have a lot of a lot of work to do.

238
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And how do you do that?

239
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Well, dude, you need money.

240
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And you need lots of it to compete.

241
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's just like if you want to become a president in the United States,

242
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
you think you can do it without at least 50 and probably more like $250 million.

243
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Well, in the future, we may be able to do it with less or maybe with nothing,

244
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
depending on how web logs and podcasts and everything start to proliferate into everybody's lives.

245
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
In order to get to get over that bridge, and I may know,

246
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
no secret of this is you need money to combat money.

247
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's just the way it is.

248
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So, and by the way, I don't want my show filled up with thousands of advertisements.

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And it's all, and we're not emulating the same business model.

250
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We're trying to change it.

251
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's what we're doing.

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And maybe you have to start at the status quo to start changing.

253
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I told you that EarthLink has heard all the comments,

254
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and they're coming back with something I think is going to make a lot of sense,

255
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
and there's more companies that are thinking this way,

256
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and they are listening, and they are smart,

257
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
but big companies are usually very, very smart and very, very slow.

258
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And in the meantime, we're just going to mess around with everything

259
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and try and figure it out.

260
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I hope you don't mind.

261
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What's we do today?

262
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Should we do Metro sexual moment or Trinity?

263
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The so many people who were, sorry, that's a black barrier again.

264
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
There are so many people who are spoofing the Metro sexual moment now

265
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
and calling me a worse,

266
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
that I think we're actually on to something really, really big here.

267
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So we'll do that today.

268
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Dear Smurdy, if this is con from on Timmel,

269
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
that's the daily podcast in the Irish language.

270
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And I'm here to tell you that this week,

271
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
we're running a competition for Valentine's Day,

272
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
with a chance to win a copy of this CD.

273
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:04,000
If the tune sounds familiar, then it should.

274
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's a classic love song from the 1960s,

275
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and it's one of 10 such songs,

276
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
which feature on the new album by Hillary Bow.

277
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The album is called Shan Nova,

278
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and it features Irish versions of classic love songs

279
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
in a bus and over style.

280
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And it's our prize for our Valentine's Day quiz on on table.

281
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The answer all you need to do is tell me,

282
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
what's the original version of that song in English?

283
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And you can send your answers via email to

284
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
immelatgmail.com.

285
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That's ime-a-l-l-l-atgmail.com.

286
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And you can check out the podcast on Timmel.

287
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's at immel.blugspot.com.

288
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Backfall to earth.

289
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, I know that song.

290
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's certainly not part safe,

291
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
so I presume somehow you figured that out.

292
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What is the name of the original?

293
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Ah, I'm not gonna weigh in.

294
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm not gonna weigh in.

295
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Do you believe anything is possible?

296
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
We do.

297
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Where are flink?

298
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
We believe in an internet that's safe

299
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
from virus hidden scammers.

300
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
We're earth-link.

301
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
We believe your personal information

302
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
should be just that personal,

303
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and we believe your internet should be a friend,

304
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
not a foe.

305
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Where are flink?

306
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Make this smart choice.

307
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000

308
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000

Earthlink.

310
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
We revolve around you.

311
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Okay, I want to clarify something right now.

312
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Despite the fact that we are called

313
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
the Mike and Michelle show,

314
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Mike and I are not a couple.

315
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Okay.

316
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Thank God for that.

317
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We fight a lot, true,

318
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
but we are not romantically involved

319
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
in any way, shape, or form.

320
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Okay.

321
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
She's kind of like an adopted sister.

322
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I wouldn't sleep with him if you paid me.

323
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Okay.

324
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The Mike and Michelle show.com.

325
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Well, how much are we talking about here?

326
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Okay.

327
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Nice voice, then Michelle.

328
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Like it very much.

329
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Today, last day for the Rocket Boom advertisement.

330
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
In fact, at the time of the recording of this podcast,

331
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
the auction on eBay has 3 hours and 48 minutes left.

332
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Current bid.

333
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
My gosh.

334
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What a jump since yesterday.

335
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
$30,900.

336
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And looks like, is that a new bidder star?

337
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Find her five?

338
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Let's see who's in the bids here,

339
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
home on a second.

340
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Star find her five, five percent card.com.

341
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Looks like Texas Dave is off the list.

342
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And then there's a new guy who came in an instant zero zero one.

343
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Man, this is pretty interesting.

344
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I mean, what happens?

345
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
By the way, the reserve is still not met.

346
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I think we got to be getting pretty close, though,

347
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
about $30 grand.

348
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
At a million impressions, just an advertising speak.

349
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That would be a $30 CPM minus all the creative that has to be done.

350
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
That's better than television, I think.

351
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
In most cases, well, depends.

352
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Rocket Boom, of course, is a hit show.

353
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So a hit show would probably command a lot more in television land.

354
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But it'll be very interesting to see what happens.

355
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Who knows what that minimum bid is, what the, what are they calling it?

356
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The reserve.

357
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So maybe they'll just wind up with nothing, but certainly very, very interesting.

358
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And what happens if someone bids and doesn't want to pay?

359
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What's the deal with that on eBay?

360
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Will they go in a rest year?

361
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Or what happens?

362
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
That's a lot of money.

363
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Certainly, because these are not traditional brands.

364
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't think that are bidding on this.

365
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
These seem to be eBay power sellers.

366
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Well, five percent, was it five percent card dot com or something?

367
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That's obviously some kind of like five percent card dot com.

368
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
No idea.

369
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Should we take a look at that?

370
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Hold on a second.

371
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Let's look at, I haven't done that.

372
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Five per, sorry.

373
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm typing with left here.

374
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Percent card dot com.

375
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm typing on the Mac, which is a level higher on the podcast complex here.

376
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Okay.

377
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Five percent card dot com.

378
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Like to save money.

379
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
There are two credit cards.

380
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Okay.

381
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Credit card company.

382
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
A credit card broker company.

383
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I guess is what it would be.

384
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Right, too.

385
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I don't know if you listened to Pacific Coast Hellway.

386
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,600
If you do on a serious stars 103, then you probably heard Sarah the 21 year old

387
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,000
virgin called in with, with her fantasy about me.

388
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I mean, it's, it's, it went so far that I won't even play it on the Stanley source code.

389
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But it was very flattering.

390
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And it kind of upsets me though at the same time.

391
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Because she didn't send it to me.

392
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
She sent it to mark, you marking the minutium mud in the, in the, in the kimono

393
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Namcov.

394
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And a true metro sexual man.

395
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And I'm thinking of myself, you know, that sucks, man.

396
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I mean, I get Roger Simholzen.

397
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
He gets Sarah the 21 year old virgin.

398
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Adam Anthony Hunt with some audio feedback regarding advertising on pod shows.

399
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
My biggest concern about advertising is the clash between trust and influence.

400
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The movie quiz shows a dramatization of a real event in 1958 where the funders of the game show

401
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
21 have a problem with their winner.

402
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So they rigged the show.

403
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So his opponent wins.

404
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And the public thinks it's a real game show.

405
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
When cigarette ads were still on TV, camel, RJ Reynolds sponsored man against crime,

406
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
starring Ralph Bellamy from 1944.

407
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The advertiser had script approval, including don't have a heavy or

408
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
disreputable person smoking.

409
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And arson cannot be in the plot because it reminds people of fire danger associated with smoking.

410
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Most recently, the Department of Education was caught paying commentators to say,

411
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
positive things about the no child left behind policy.

412
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The commentators are supposed to be free from outside influence.

413
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That becomes public relations not commentary.

414
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
My thoughts on product placement.

415
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm fine with dramas and sitcoms using actual products as props because I know that some

416
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
would not have been made without that placement.

417
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
However, rewrite a scene specifically for the right shot of the advertiser's product or

418
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
change the script to conform to that sponsor.

419
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And you've lost me as a listener viewer.

420
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I have a problem with all the radio payola and people who get paid to talk up the various

421
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
bands on college campuses because no one really wants to acknowledge these practices.

422
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And yet I recently read the summary of report given that the word of mouth marketing conference

423
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
which said that people actually follow up on comments about advertisers much more when

424
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
people are above board with their sponsorship up to 70% more because they're curious.

425
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I think of some of the stuff that happens on cover villains as an example.

426
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The trust factor between host and listener becomes huge here.

427
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So your comments about senseo or apple are given a completely different way to commentary rather than advertising.

428
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I don't hate earth length because they are your sponsor.

429
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It merely changes the reference that I place on comments you might make about them.

430
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
By the way, 30 seconds definitely is too long.

431
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Try the public broadcasting model of 15 and don't put more than two of those together.

432
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So anyway, I get your sponsors.

433
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
So you can quit your day job, but absolutely be honest with your listeners.

434
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So they can continue to trust you and resonate with the things that you do say legitimately.

435
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Thank you.

436
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Okay, a couple things there.

437
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
First of all, I have no idea what the cover real reference was all about.

438
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That was disturbing.

439
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So let me know what's going on with that.

440
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Regarding the old TV shows and historical facts that you cited,

441
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I think it's a little bit different though when there is limited frequency and limited channels.

442
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And of course time by definition is then limited to 24 hours per channel.

443
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Particularly when these are sanctioned and licensed by the government.

444
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So there are all kinds of rules that have to come into play there.

445
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Download.acview.com.

446
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm going to try not to do that too often.

447
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
A lot of people hate the burping thing.

448
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So when it comes to the game show quizzes or changing scenes, et cetera, et cetera.

449
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:21,000
If there's no equal airtime for someone to combat that or if there's no opportunity for you to leave that and go somewhere else,

450
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
which has certainly hasn't been up until the past 20 years as channels.

451
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm just expanded massively.

452
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And of course on the internet, if you don't like what you're listening.

453
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
If you don't like what you're hearing on a podcast.

454
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Well, you don't have to listen to it and you're not forced.

455
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Because that's the only thing you can listen to between seven and eight in the morning or the evening or whatever you would listen to it.

456
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So I think there's a huge difference there.

457
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Let's just set that aside for a second.

458
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You said so much.

459
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Regarding the public radio model versus 30 seconds, 15 seconds do that is so unimportant.

460
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
First of all, public radio, they're so called sponsorship model.

461
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's just commercial.

462
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Let's just advertise.

463
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And there's all kinds of deals going on.

464
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And we all know it.

465
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
There is no limit.

466
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I don't believe we've done a single sale at Pod Show.

467
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And we've already sold millions of dollars worth of advertising.

468
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't think we've done a single sale that was based upon an amount of time.

469
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Interestingly enough, the advertisers in some cases have given us the earthlink spot.

470
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I've given us their standard kind of like radio based 30 second spot, which as I said, watch for that to change.

471
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:47,000
But if you talk about like the I dog or even download.acqview.com, Heather and Janelle, their show.

472
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,000
There's been no limit placed on me nor do I impose any limit about how long I can talk about a certain product.

473
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And I really truly believe that people who listen to this show.

474
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I don't want to insult them the way you did.

475
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
They really do understand the difference between a commercial message and something that's just coming from the heart.

476
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And I think I've been very open and I've said right off the bat whenever something was a paid endorsement.

477
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Because that's really what it is when I talk about something in the show.

478
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It's endorsement.

479
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But you know, I don't say standby here comes an earthlink commercial.

480
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
No, people here at they understand it.

481
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
But you know, you mentioned like Apple and since sale, I'm not getting paid by any of those companies.

482
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And if they did, I would be very open about it.

483
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And I would hope my listeners would be very happy for me and happy for themselves.

484
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
What I'm trying right now is I'm trying to get companies interested in stuff that we're talking about.

485
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
For example, the metro sexual moment we talk about all different types of razors.

486
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I would certainly not mind my audience being compensated by giving them some free product to test and talk about.

487
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And in exchange, I think I should get paid too.

488
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Nothing wrong with that.

489
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
We already have the conversation going and I'm not calling.

490
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You know, we, I don't give a shit.

491
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I really, really don't.

492
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
That's going to be plenty of really interesting advertisers coming into podcasting.

493
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And I determine, as a representative of my audience, what I think is appropriate and what is not appropriate.

494
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And how I want to do things that are appropriate or not appropriate.

495
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Now, what I don't determine is the amount of time we have on the serious satellite stars one or three channel.

496
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Because our satellite window is closing in 10 seconds.

497
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Specific host hell way is coming up.

498
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Then Mad wine steam with yeast radio and boy is she pissed and don't enjoy after that.

499
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And I will see you guys tomorrow and thank God it's Friday edition.

500
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I think I went over by one second.

501
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Oh, I'm so happy with this.

502
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
To the nanosecond precise timer that Casplaster might put together for me.

503
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Oh, it's wonderful.

504
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Thank you for us still giving all that feedback about timers.

505
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So what Mike did is he basically built a really, really, really robust timer that will work for you too.

506
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And it's built into the latest beta.

507
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So I guess everyone else can try the same thing.

508
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Hey, speaking of the Metro sexual moment.

509
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Metro sexual.

510
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Metro sexual.

511
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Metro sexual.

512
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Metro sexual.

513
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It's an increased Metro sexual moment.

514
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
An increased Metro sexual moment.

515
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Yeah.

516
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Now, before we get started with the audio feedbacks.

517
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Thank you very much.

518
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I'm going for sending them in.

519
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Let me just make you aware of the fact that pink is the color.

520
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Does the color do you or for us, man?

521
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It may seem really weird.

522
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
My daughter gave me a pink sweater for Christmas.

523
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And wearing that thing, I've gotten so many compliments from so many women.

524
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
All kinds of women.

525
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And you should try it.

526
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I know it.

527
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It sounds really weird and it may feel weird.

528
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But what's going on?

529
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So take that from your Metro sexual moment on the daily source code.

530
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So this is Derek DeBandard from Janisburg in South Africa.

531
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Just finished listening to Delta Sierra Charlie 331 in the Metro sexual moment.

532
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And I had to laugh.

533
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I could not believe it.

534
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
You have the same problem as I do.

535
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
During my hair by myself, it just does not work for me.

536
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I have to have the help of my wife's creative hands.

537
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I have a kind of Monday to Friday hairstyle with a bit of laurel studio line.

538
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Kind of stuff that I was rubbing to my hair.

539
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And that's it.

540
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Nothing special.

541
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Over weekends.

542
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Then I've got to hit the clubs.

543
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Look cool.

544
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And I don't look cool when I do my hair.

545
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Just like you on German TV.

546
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Fuck you.

547
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Thank goodness.

548
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You've got Patricia.

549
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
My wife recently became an M-way member.

550
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Now you know it's all about buying certain products and building your business network

551
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and bloody bloody blah.

552
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But the amazing thing is I am getting all these wonderful hair products to try.

553
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
So maybe someone from M-way wouldn't mind sending you some hair gel.

554
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So I just thought I'd share that Metro sexual moment with you.

555
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Not being able to do my own hair myself.

556
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So I relate to you here at the bottom of Africa.

557
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Thank you so much for what you're doing.

558
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Love the show.

559
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Do not miss a single episode.

560
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It's really cool.

561
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You are a legend, sir.

562
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
From a check out my podcast, it is www.soundrepublic.co.zate.

563
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Thank you, sir.

564
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
You take care.

565
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Cheers.

566
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Cheers.

567
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Cheers.

568
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I use, but what is it?

569
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Paul Mitchell.

570
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And then I used some other like crap to put my hair.

571
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Doesn't matter.

572
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I can't do it.

573
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It never looks good.

574
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I walk around during the week like a degenerate.

575
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And they usually don't shave until, you know, we hit a Metro sexual moment.

576
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
That's it.

577
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Oh yeah, I should do that once in a while.

578
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But like yesterday, Patricia was feeling a little rundown.

579
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
So I said, hey, you know what?

580
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I'll go with you to Sainsbury and we'll go do the shopping.

581
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Now of course, Sainsbury is exactly the spot where all these dickhead paparazzi

582
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
hang out and try to take horrible pictures of Patricia Lee.

583
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So I was well prepared.

584
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And Patricia prepared me and said, well, you know, let me just do your hair before we go.

585
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I knew what you was talking about.

586
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
She didn't want to look like shit on another picture.

587
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Yes, of course.

588
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Hair tips and comments are welcome in our little Metro sexual corner.

589
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
You bet.

590
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Hey Adam, this is Chef Mark with a K in New York City.

591
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And I heard you showed today.

592
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You were talking about wrestling and troubles.

593
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And I tell you what, I will wrestle anyone anywhere.

594
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
If you're feeling a ring full of shave truffles.

595
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Now mind you not chocolate truffles but the real thing.

596
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I will wrestle anyone I have to to get at those truffles.

597
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,000
So for your Metro sexual moment, you had someone calling in asking about shaving the neck area and the razor burn.

598
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And I think part of what happens why that's more irritating is because we have a tendency to shave upwards

599
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
when we get to the neck and the hair tends to grow downwards.

600
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And they always say that you should shave in the direction of the hair growth.

601
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And so that's probably why it's easier to get irritated.

602
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And plus I would say, you know, put some moisturizer or something before you put shaving cream to sort of prepare the skin for that.

603
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So anyway, that's my little Metro sexual moment tip.

604
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And while I got you here, I will share with you another one of my kitchen quick tips, which I put on my most recent show that's going out,

605
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
which is getting greens really dry before you use them.

606
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
A lot of times, you know, you bring greens or herbs home from the store.

607
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You need to wash them before you store them or before you even just make a salad.

608
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Also, you know, wash them with throw them in a salad spinner and we spin it out.

609
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Well, it doesn't always get 100% dry.

610
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
After that, crumple of a couple of paper towels, put them in the salad spinner and give it another go.

611
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And the paper towels will absorb the remaining water that's in there and get your greens nice and dry.

612
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
So that you can store them in the fridge and they'll last longer.

613
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
You can hear more of my kitchen quick tips on my podcast, the Remarkable Palette podcast.

614
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You can find it on iTunes or at RemarkablePalette.logspot.com.

615
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Thanks Adam, and get that wrestling ring ready for me.

616
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Yeah, the curry hogs are already out sniffing for the truffles from us.

617
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And whatever you do, listeners, do not wash the herbs.

618
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Hey Adam, I'm a bit behind, but I was listening to DSC on 2306.

619
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And there's no way that Dr. Bronner's soap is metro sexual at all.

620
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I've used Dr. Bronner's pure castile for a while, then originally bought it for a rafting trip down the Grand Canyon.

621
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
The soap is perfect for the outdoorsmen in your family because it's biodegradable.

622
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
You can buy it.

623
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I love peppermint, but my barrel chested father digs the almond flavor.

624
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
The peppermint makes my chest hair tingle.

625
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I'm an artist, can you plug my website?

626
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Sure, Davelemortit.com.

627
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
That's Delta Alpha Victor Eco Lima Alpha.

628
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
The hell is M?

629
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Mike Oscar Romeo Tango Echo.

630
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Sorry, senior moment there for a second.

631
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Ah, here's an old fan of the show, or not so old fan, but someone's been listening for a while.

632
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Rish.

633
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I keep messing up his name.

634
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Rishab Kumar.

635
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I hope I did it right now.

636
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Hey, Mr. Curry.

637
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Oh, that hurts.

638
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
My father purchased a Gillette fusion at Walmart.

639
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
In fact, recently, he told me that with the precision blade,

640
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
it's gotten rid of his razor burn on his neck.

641
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Yeah, so whenever I need a razor, I'm 14, not needing one yet.

642
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I'll be sure to be using the Gillette fusion for that precision blade.

643
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Definitely check out the fusion.

644
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
It's a really nifty product.

645
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
My father has the battery powered one.

646
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
That's a normal motion for Gillette.

647
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I mean, that's obvious.

648
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
You're probably going to use the same product your dad uses.

649
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
All right.

650
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
One more then.

651
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
There we go.

652
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Ah, shit that has music in it.

653
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
How could I miss that one up?

654
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
All right.

655
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Well, let's end the metro section.

656
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
We can get to that final comment.

657
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Yeah.

658
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Yeah.

659
00:31:47,000 --> 00:32:04,000
G-I-T-M-O-S-A-P-I-N-S-G-I-Z-U-M-O-S-A-N-S-G-I-Z-U-M-O-S-A-U-S-A-N-S.

660
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Coming to you from the heart of it all.

661
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It's G-S-M-O-S-A-N-S.

662
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
An entertainment and technology podcast.

663
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Hey, Adam.

664
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
This is Chris from the G-S-M-O-S-A-N-S podcast.

665
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Listen to your show yesterday and you're talking in your metro sexual moment about razor burn.

666
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And I have the same eye to have the same problem.

667
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I actually don't use anything for it.

668
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I follow an old army recommendation that is probably older than where I remember.

669
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Getting in from.

670
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I'm not old enough to have served in Vietnam, but I do know that from the Vietnam work till now

671
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:03,000
in soldiers who were stationed in jungle areas were told to shave and cold water.

672
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And that's supposed to help reduce razor burn and it seems to do that pretty well for me.

673
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
The other thing that's cool about it is you warm yourself up in the shower to open those pores.

674
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It's really refreshing to come out and come a shaving real cold water.

675
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Just thought I would add that little bit of knowledge to you and love your show.

676
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Good luck with it.

677
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
All right.

678
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I'd never heard of that one.

679
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I don't know if that.

680
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Okay.

681
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Army guys, check in now, William.

682
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I know lots of you are metro sexual.

683
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And next time, Winston in a comment, please don't put any music underneath your voice.

684
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I'm curious, metro sexual moment.

685
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Yeah.

686
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
All right.

687
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Hey Adam says, uh, what's this?

688
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Jupiter.

689
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Everyone says that the belching and sincere were linked.

690
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Well, I was reminded of your show because of a lighter.

691
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I was camping in my friend tried to light a candle with his lighter and I immediately thought

692
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
about the daily source code.

693
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I use a real player on Palm OS, PDA, XIR, 31.

694
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
The time was exact.

695
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Okay.

696
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I love the show.

697
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
My friend and I think about starting a podcast just waiting for the PDA end.

698
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Oh, yeah.

699
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I wanted to mention about the pot safe music network.

700
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I think today is the day when we're going to, um,

701
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
now there's two things that that are going to launch and I, um,

702
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
and they're already working here for me.

703
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So I haven't seen it yet on the public site.

704
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
One is, and this is really cool.

705
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
We got a really nice player that we're going to release that is going to be a much,

706
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
much better experience for anyone just perusing the site he wants to listen to some tunes.

707
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Um, that's one.

708
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
The second one is the buy feature.

709
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And, um, it's not publicly available yet.

710
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So I'm presuming it's going to happen today.

711
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
If you're interested in testing this out, um, then you'll be able to purchase

712
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
if every day we're Christmas from Podsay for peace.

713
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
All the proceeds go to UNICEF after the nine cents is deducted for the transaction cost.

714
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
We're not taking anything.

715
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And, you know, SLOW is on the up and up.

716
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So if you want to test it out,

717
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
you can probably just go to that page and you just hit it a couple times.

718
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I'd wait until, you know, kind of like midday Pacific time at least.

719
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Um, and if, if it definitely is not happening, I'll post something at curry.com.

720
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
But I'm pretty sure everything's good to go.

721
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And so you'll be able to, um,

722
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
by the way, if you're already a listener, um, or a, or a podcaster,

723
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
or an artist, you'll be able to use your current password to log in.

724
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
You will be asked to create a new password at your discretion for, uh,

725
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
the actual credit card piece because we can't hold any of that data.

726
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
So you will need a separate password for that.

727
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
But all the other fields are populated and everything is made very simply.

728
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And again, we're not building a store.

729
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
This is a part of the unlabel.

730
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And the unlabel is where artists are their own record companies.

731
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And they're working with different parties, such as podcasts,

732
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
such as listeners, fans of their, of their music.

733
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Um, to create their own marketing buzz, uh,

734
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,000
to get, uh, yeah, really to get exposure as, as, as many places as they can.

735
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Excuse me, I'm not, I'm going to do it.

736
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Now, what did you just say when you heard that?

737
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Belts kind of muffled away.

738
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
What was it linked to?

739
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
So hopefully that'll be a live today.

740
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Um, and I'm very, very excited about it.

741
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And these are all MP3s in the clear.

742
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Um, if you lose it, you can go back into the store.

743
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Go download a fresh copy.

744
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Um, and this entire system is built around faith in humankind and the opportunity

745
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,000
to show the world that a people like music aren't all thieves and crooks,

746
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
and that we do want to invest in talent.

747
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And the money is going to the people who are making it happen.

748
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You know, not to big corporation.

749
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
God, there was a, there was a fantastic article in, you know,

750
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
it's on the floor here.

751
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Hold on one second.

752
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Let me just, I'll open up the other mic.

753
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Man, well, I walk over here.

754
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
There we go.

755
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I'm sorry.

756
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Let me just guess this.

757
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Fantastic article in the, uh, financial times yesterday.

758
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Uh, by Alan Levy, who is the chairman and chief executive of EMI music.

759
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Music's revolution is not to be feared.

760
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And he goes in to say how fantastic it's going and how incredibly modern they are.

761
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Um, and there's some contradictions in there.

762
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
The thing that would that kind of made me chuckle.

763
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Uh, the new music business models keep coming.

764
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
We recently licensed our music to GNAB, the first pan European legal peer to peer service.

765
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Oh, you are so hit.

766
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Whatever the technology from satellite radio to podcasting,

767
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
we work with companies and legislators to ensure that our artists work and the

768
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
investments we make in their work is fairly compensated.

769
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Gee, I can't, can't seem to find the memo or the letter you sent me about that.

770
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Here's some fantastic news.

771
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And this is right on the spot for me.

772
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Uh, Ryan Stevens sent me this fantastic link.

773
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Virgin airways, man.

774
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
These guys never cease to amaze me.

775
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
You know, I'm a frequent flyer on virgin.

776
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I've now have almost 200,000 frequent flyer miles.

777
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And when I made my, my recent bookings to New York and to San Francisco,

778
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I said, hey, you know, how about the space trip?

779
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I hear that, you know, you can, you can get a spot on the,

780
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
on, on Branson space bird, um, just with, with miles within a,

781
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
you can, you can, you can cash in your miles.

782
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And it was, I mean, so nice on the phone.

783
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Maybe it's just the accent, but, um, she looked it up for me.

784
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Yeah, 2 million miles.

785
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
2 million miles before you get a free space trip.

786
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I got to fly a hell of a lot more.

787
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Um, anyway, so for some reason this page is not loading.

788
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I don't know what's going on.

789
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Um, but Virgin Atlantic has introduced a blackberry clinic for upper class passengers.

790
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
At the Heathrow Clubhouse.

791
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Um, oh my goodness.

792
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I got a page in Spanish.

793
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
The hell is that?

794
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Why is this happening?

795
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Oh, I see.

796
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
You were all got messed up.

797
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Okay.

798
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Anyway, um, so the, the blackberry clinic helps you with tips and tricks

799
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
and, uh, and how to use your blackberry more efficiently.

800
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
And I can't wait because I hope the clinic will be open.

801
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Um, when I, when I leave on Sunday, um, because my broken and I just want to, you know,

802
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I have to go through this whole rigmarole on the phone calling 800 number.

803
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I have to, you know, give out, you know, our tax ID numbers,

804
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
and all this incredible crap just to prove that this thing is broken.

805
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
So maybe they can help me on the spot.

806
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Speaking of help, and this is a big one.

807
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Um, I'm going to go to the Apple Insider website.

808
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Apparently in the forthcoming update to OS 10.

809
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Yeah, I'm going to read from Apple Insider.

810
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Uh, or is it?

811
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Um, according to tipsters and reports, already present on the internet's Apple.

812
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:01,000
This week, seated the fourth external build of Mac OS 10.4.5 for PowerPC Max.

813
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
That would be the one that I bought.

814
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
The build reportedly labeled Mac OS X 10.4.5.8H14.

815
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
God, that's marketing.

816
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
It's said to address issues with multi application audio support in the distribution of the operating

817
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
system update offered to Apple developer connection members.

818
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Apple did not list any known issues.

819
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Okay.

820
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Well, it would be great if that was fixed, but I got to tell you one thing.

821
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Uh, it's not going to make any difference.

822
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I am completely sold on cast blaster.

823
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Ah, crap.

824
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
The wrong one.

825
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I'm sorry about that.

826
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I had a bit of a different accent.

827
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
The elishness point.

828
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
How lame is that?

829
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
That I said I'm sold on cast blaster and then I misfires something.

830
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm still sold on cast blaster.

831
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And if you look at the cast blaster forum,

832
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
then now talking about something I'm really excited about.

833
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
About adding a MIDI control surface to cast blaster.

834
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
So you could have basically, you know, a little box with faders,

835
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
and you could control the software externally, which, of course,

836
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
would help me with exactly this problem.

837
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
It could set up buttons to fire stuff and you can fade stuff in and out.

838
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And I think Mike is getting into the idea.

839
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I had a bit of a different accent.

840
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Feellessness.

841
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
And this is Jim from the UK.

842
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Also known as the Daddy Douse.

843
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I was wondering if you could use your influence with Apple.

844
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
They get something sorted.

845
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Something's changed in the last version of iTunes.

846
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I've got a smart playlist, which is podcast not listens to.

847
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Where the play count is greater than zero.

848
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I don't include anything from the podcast group.

849
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
It used to be that I had to listen to the whole podcast before.

850
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It would register as a listen count.

851
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And therefore I could pause the podcast.

852
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
There was sync.

853
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
And then go back to me podcast not listened.

854
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And play from the last position that I was so, for instance,

855
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
this week in tech.

856
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It's about an hour long.

857
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Get to half an hour through it.

858
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Sink the iPod, go back.

859
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And then I can pick up at 35 minutes.

860
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
It now transpires that somewhere during the playback.

861
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It's registering as a listen.

862
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
So I'll lose it from my act of playlist instantaneously.

863
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Even on the iPods or something's changed on the ear on the phone.

864
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Whether the pod.

865
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I just please Apple put it back because it's so irritating.

866
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
So if anybody's listening, you know what to do.

867
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Anyway, thanks an anticipation.

868
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Let's see how many people can guess where I'm from just by my accent.

869
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Thanks very much, mate.

870
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
But Birmingham.

871
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Just a guess.

872
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I did know that had happened.

873
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And quite frankly, my the smart playlist I've set up doesn't do a play count.

874
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
But that's interesting that now the plays are registered even if you just listen to it a little bit.

875
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
You should be able to switch that off.

876
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Obviously that should be an advanced setting.

877
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
One thing about the cartoon controversy.

878
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Joseph Young says hi.

879
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I'm just a follow up.

880
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Yes, they the cultural editor of I'm going to screw this up.

881
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Elon Sposten, which is the newspaper who published the the offending cartoons in Denmark.

882
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Proposed get this publishing cartoons of Christian and Jewish themes along with other things cartoon along with other cartoons of the holocaust

883
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:23,000
in cooperation with the challenge sent out by the Iranian newspaper.

884
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Hey, look.

885
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:31,000
This actually gets back to the previous comment about editorial and advertising and all that stuff.

886
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I think that this is so stupid.

887
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
What does this have to do with news?

888
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Stop making the news.

889
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You dickhead?

890
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Stop making the news report on the news.

891
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
This is really what's happening.

892
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I think that mainstream media, some of them are smoking, you know, they're on dope obviously.

893
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
But I do think that they, you know, they're not dumb.

894
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
They listen around.

895
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
They always on the lookout for stuff.

896
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
And they're hearing and they're seeing.

897
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
And they're reading.

898
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And they're saying to themselves, my God, some of this is really good.

899
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
You know, there are no secrets.

900
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Only information you don't yet have.

901
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
So what's the differentiator?

902
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Everybody can get to the same information.

903
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Everybody can report on the news and do just a shitty job.

904
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I think they really do see the writing on the wall.

905
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And I do believe that people are smart enough.

906
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Once they, you know, we grew up with newspapers being authority.

907
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
We grew up with television news being an authority.

908
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
My daughter's not growing up with newspapers as an authority.

909
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
She's not growing up with television being an authority.

910
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
She does question things that she reads.

911
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
She doesn't take any one single web posting as the truth either.

912
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I really see that, you know, the next generation is going to,

913
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
It's just not going to be, there can't be bothered.

914
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Then a bothered bothered.

915
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Does it do it like bothered?

916
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
God, I love Katherine Tate.

917
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And they'll, and they'll be making their own truths by, well, you could call it triangulating.

918
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
But I think it'll be a number of things.

919
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Look at what we've learned just on this show, just by opening up a dialogue about this controversy.

920
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Gosh, I'm getting so madonna on you.

921
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
That's today.

922
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Just by opening up this controversy, the discussion about it,

923
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I've learned all these things that I didn't learn from mainstream media.

924
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Why?

925
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
They're restricted by time.

926
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,000
They only have 24 hours in a day for the channels that they have available for each individual channel.

927
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
We can do this for as long as we want.

928
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
You can skip around, go forward, go back to whatever you want.

929
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
It's beautiful, love it.

930
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
So obviously, that's pretty stupid.

931
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Oh, man.

932
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Let's see.

933
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
You know, I have like three more specific things.

934
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I just, I've been sitting here in cast blast that I haven't been getting to for the past four shows.

935
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Let's just run through them.

936
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
We're going to go along.

937
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
We'll probably be up to an hour today.

938
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
But if you stick with it, I hope it's worth it.

939
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
You've heard it all before.

940
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Baby, I just want you to be sure.

941
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Just stop and change the name.

942
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Baby, I just want you to be safe.

943
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I love it when you take me.

944
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Baby, I love it.

945
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
No, just release me.

946
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I want it to be easy.

947
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Baby, I just need you to believe.

948
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Hey, Adam.

949
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
This is David.

950
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I'm a fellow podcaster out here in podcasting land or the potto sphere.

951
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I had a comment about Delta Sierra Charlie in 325.

952
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
He had a listener of that commented that there was a lack of enhanced AAC file support

953
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
tools for the PC.

954
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
And I wholeheartedly agree with that.

955
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Your reference to version tracker in your show was intriguing.

956
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
But you didn't mention the software application that you used.

957
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
And it wasn't in your show notes.

958
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
So I went to verse tracker.com and searched on AAC and didn't really see anything that

959
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
looked promising.

960
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
So if you remember what the name of that software was, or if any of your listeners know,

961
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
it'd be great to have that.

962
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Also, I had a comment about podcasting production.

963
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I'm glad to hear that.

964
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Cast blasters going well for you.

965
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I've tried it myself and liked it.

966
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I'm recording my comment today with it.

967
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I sympathized with your math problems and we're glad to hear that you've bought a PC.

968
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I wanted to welcome you back to the good side of the force.

969
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Last comment was, there really isn't any good podcaster modules.

970
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
For any of the major open source CMS systems content management systems.

971
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
WordPress doesn't have one, PHP.

972
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Nuke doesn't have one.

973
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Drupal has a basic one and the author is promising a new one, but has not released it yet.

974
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,000
In fact, he's demoing it on his website, but he's not sharing it, which I think just sucks.

975
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:01,000
PHP website also has a basic podcaster module that I've been using for some time and modified it.

976
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
But there's lots of features missing.

977
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:11,000
For example, you can't specify a file, an MP3 file or an audio file that's not in the website,

978
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
which is not so good.

979
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
So in summary, I just want to be able to have a good tool to produce and edit my podcast.

980
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I want to be able to offer my listeners an easily navigable file.

981
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
And I want to have a good place to put them and manage my feeds.

982
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
So those are my comments in any information that you or your listeners could give to me.

983
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
That would be great.

984
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I'm sure there are a lot of podcasters out there that are wondering the same thing.

985
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Bye for now.

986
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:41,000
So regarding the enhanced podcast and creating them on windows.

987
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Now, there's something that cast blasts from sure could do.

988
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I know cast blasts are Mike has been messing around with that.

989
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
So I know that it's on the radar.

990
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Now, you know, I've been podcasting for...

991
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
How long is it now?

992
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Well over a year and a half.

993
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
But when I say podcasting, I mean, really doing this all on the computer.

994
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Those of you who have been listening since the first show know that I've really tried to make it all work on a computer.

995
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I just want basically a podcast studio in a box.

996
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And cast blasts are the only thing that even comes close.

997
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And I strayed for a while.

998
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I have to admit there are all kinds of issues and all kinds of reasons.

999
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I think many of them really had to do with a really, really poor shitty quality of the tablet PC.

1000
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Which, by the way, I still want to send to those medical guys.

1001
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
They're doing the development for, you know, make...

1002
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Keep people alive.

1003
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Does anyone have a CD for Windows tablet edition?

1004
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Because I don't want to give the crap what as it is.

1005
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Or if you can tell me how I can wipe all the contents off of, you know, all of my documents and stuff.

1006
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
So I can send it off these guys.

1007
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Please let me know.

1008
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
So, but I've come back to cast blasts.

1009
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:55,000
And really, what's happened is I'm realizing that, you know, with the digital mixture that is now built in with the...

1010
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Limited that is built in on the mic with all the different capabilities.

1011
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Now with the extended panel, so I can fit all the stuff in that I need to fit in there.

1012
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
And, you know, with just a future smell of maybe a MIDI control surface,

1013
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
it's going to be exactly what you want.

1014
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:19,000
In fact, the coolest part that I think is cool about cast blasts is, you know, right now,

1015
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
if you've used it, you know, when you're done, you...

1016
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
The first thing you want to do is just save your file.

1017
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I mean, I'm just... I think that should stay in there.

1018
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
You always want to have your local copy.

1019
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
So there's really two button.

1020
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
You have to two click process.

1021
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
There is no step three.

1022
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
So you save the file and then you click upload the server and it FTPs up to wherever you want it.

1023
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Already built into cast blasts.

1024
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And almost functional, having some issues with the...

1025
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
With the transfer protocol, minor issues, but those will get fixed.

1026
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
It'll be one click.

1027
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
And then the show notes that you enter into cast blasts.

1028
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
You know, your show name, your naming conventions, all that stuff,

1029
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
will automatically be put up on the...

1030
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Potio podcast delivery network.

1031
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
All in one go.

1032
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
So, you'll be managing your feeds, as you call it,

1033
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
directly from cast blaster.

1034
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
It's going to be... It's... It's really beautiful.

1035
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
In fact, I'm not a very popular guy.

1036
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I don't think around a Potio HQ...

1037
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Well, not yesterday at least, because I basically pulled the emergency break on the assembly line.

1038
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
We were about to open up some data spots and get some stuff going.

1039
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
But, you know, just a couple of things weren't quite right.

1040
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
And this is stuff that... You know, I've been so involved...

1041
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
This is what I'm trying to say.

1042
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I've been so involved in podcasting.

1043
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I know... And we've gone...

1044
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Stray in many, many, many ways.

1045
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
It made it so complicated.

1046
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
You know, people talking about RSS feeds.

1047
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I don't think you should have to talk about that.

1048
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
It should just be done with it all.

1049
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
And you should just know that it's inscribable.

1050
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
You know, and the same thing... You know, you want statistics.

1051
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Yeah, you want... There's all kinds of stuff.

1052
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And so, we're almost ready to release some stuff.

1053
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And it just wasn't quite there yet.

1054
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
So, I pulled the break and that'll definitely delay us by a week or so.

1055
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
But it's coming.

1056
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
It is definitely coming.

1057
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And it's going to be cool.

1058
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And I think it's what... Just about every single feature we could come up with for the PDN is there.

1059
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Including the opportunity to grow your audience.

1060
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
And yes, to make money.

1061
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Hey Adam.

1062
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
This is there and of there in the show.

1063
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I'm gonna strive home.

1064
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And I just want everyone to know that this Saturday,

1065
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,000
February 11th is my one year anniversary in podcasting.

1066
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
All your fall.

1067
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I just want to add that.

1068
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
It is all your fall.

1069
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
It was inspired by you.

1070
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
And I thank you.

1071
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
And all of my listeners thank you.

1072
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
So please tune in to there in the show.

1073
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I'm gonna strive to go to the website.

1074
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
D-D-D-Home.com email me.

1075
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:53,000
D-D-D-Home at gmail.com and listen for the one year anniversary special.

1076
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Thank you.

1077
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Okay, I love you.

1078
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Bye-bye.

1079
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Adam.

1080
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
This is Trevor Carpenter of The Scride Music Show.

1081
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
SMS is a Christian music pod show.

1082
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
And I've been podcasting since December of 05.

1083
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Now, as Terrace for real Christian music and radio stations have demonstrated,

1084
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
the audience for Christian content is huge.

1085
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
However, the Christian listener is as disenfranchised

1086
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
with the big labels and radio conglomerates as anyone.

1087
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Many in the Christian community have witnessed talented artists

1088
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
start a strong career with a strong message

1089
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
only to see a big label suck them in and water them down.

1090
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
In the very early days of the PMN,

1091
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I found some great and powerful Christian artists with a strong message.

1092
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Artists like a dream of Thorpe, whom you've played on there

1093
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
over there on the DSC.

1094
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Matthew Castile, Waba, Eric Vardeman, just an image of you.

1095
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
With podcasting and pod show,

1096
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
and the artists to consume redistribution channels

1097
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
having now been transformed,

1098
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
artists won't feel the need of pressure

1099
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
to water down their message or to standardise their sound

1100
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
in order to fit into one of three or four categories.

1101
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I really do thank God for what you and pod show

1102
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
we're doing over there.

1103
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
It's really great.

1104
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
One of the first podcasts I started listening to

1105
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
on a regular basis was DSC.

1106
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Shortly thereafter, I added the life spring pod cast.

1107
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
As a Christian, there are some things

1108
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
on the DSC, I'd rather skip everyone's in a while

1109
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
and sometimes I do,

1110
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
but because I would have no idea what's going on

1111
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
on the podcasting community,

1112
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I continue to subscribe.

1113
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Now, I have noticed that you've been adding

1114
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
some great podcasters to your mix over there at pod show.

1115
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And most of these folks have either been pod casting

1116
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
over a year or have rapidly built up

1117
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
an incredibly large audience.

1118
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Of course, as you're beta testing so much

1119
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
of this new pod show delivery network,

1120
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I understand the desire to have established podcasters

1121
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
to utilize and test the systems and procedures.

1122
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
However, your statistics will be slightly flawed

1123
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
when you get up to speed

1124
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
and advertiser starts to see

1125
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
the influx of pod show pod cast related traffic.

1126
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Much of the hard work will have been on the

1127
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
max of the pod show podcasters prior

1128
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
to them joining the pod show.

1129
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Now, that's not an attack.

1130
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I just want to raise your awareness

1131
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
to the statistical research that will be inferred

1132
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
in the coming months.

1133
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Now, I suggest that you add a few more podcasters

1134
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
to the mix prior to making it open to all.

1135
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Pick a few strong podcasters who are not veterans

1136
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
and have a smaller audience.

1137
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
This will be hard.

1138
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Just task someone over there pod show

1139
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
to spend a day listening to the most

1140
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
current episode of as many podcasters they can find.

1141
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
They could start with the promo submissions

1142
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
over at promos.podshow.com.

1143
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
What you really need is a small contingent of rookies

1144
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
who have something interesting to say to an existing audience.

1145
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
These freshmen will give you

1146
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
and the other leaders over there

1147
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
a good idea of how well the pod show machine

1148
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
helps yield a strong harvest.

1149
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I recommend focusing on genres

1150
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
that you know already have a strong

1151
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
traditional media segment.

1152
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Like sports commentary, political talk,

1153
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
and oh, Christian music.

1154
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Hey, I know a great Christian music pod.

1155
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Yeah, this entire message was written

1156
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
as a shameless, shameless plug

1157
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
to convince you to invite me to join pod show.

1158
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Now, I'm not pulling this wisdom out of my red.

1159
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I really do believe in what I've drafted here.

1160
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I'm so confident in my future

1161
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
as a member of the pod show family

1162
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
that I've included several ways for you

1163
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
and your cohorts at pod show there to contact me.

1164
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
You can reach me at the email you received is from

1165
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
or you could give me a call.

1166
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I put my phone numbers

1167
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
and my Skype name right there in the email body.

1168
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Adam, don't fail me

1169
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
and don't fail the pod show family.

1170
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Well, you just have to wait a little bit longer.

1171
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Everyone's going to be welcome to join in.

1172
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
No worries there.

1173
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Yeah, what's interesting though is there's this assumption

1174
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
that, you know, we picked and picked and chose

1175
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
all these different shows.

1176
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Dude, we went to the pod cast

1177
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
or the portable media expo

1178
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
just to meet with anyone who was motivated

1179
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
and have to come over and meet

1180
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
and didn't listen to emni.

1181
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I was familiar with some of the shows obviously

1182
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
but a lot of them I'd never heard before.

1183
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I had no idea.

1184
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I don't know what people's audiences

1185
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
totally not interested.

1186
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I just want people who would be interested

1187
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
and being, you know, a part of trying to build

1188
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
something new and network and get something going.

1189
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
And obviously there's some special compensation

1190
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
for that.

1191
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
No doubt.

1192
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
No doubt.

1193
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
So we really are building this with pod cast

1194
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
so just when people just don't get invited

1195
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,000
then they send like 3 minute and 20 second audio comments.

1196
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
But all kidding aside, you will be welcome dude.

1197
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
So the Grammy's Ron last night

1198
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I completely missed it and of course we can't play anything

1199
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
from that side of the music business.

1200
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I wonder why Mariah Carey didn't win that many as she thought.

1201
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
She looked cool and she shiver

1202
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
even though the sun was shining down

1203
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
life it rolled on this window

1204
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
but she couldn't even hear the sound

1205
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I could tell by the recall finds

1206
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
like a mappress crossing her face

1207
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
she had seen what down on her

1208
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
but it brought her here to this place

1209
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:23,000
it's amazing what this life can put you through.

1210
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Yes it is.

1211
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:31,000
There's a choice to make in all the things you do.

1212
00:58:31,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

1213
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:31,000
oh oh oh oh

1214
00:59:31,000 --> 01:00:01,000
oh oh oh oh

1215
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:31,000
oh

1216
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:39,320
oh

1217
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:18,280
Now, before you get the wrong idea, that of course is not Mariah Carey.

1218
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,280
It's better.

1219
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,800
It's Mariah without the attitude, it's an Adley Brown from the Podsive Music Network.

1220
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:26,600
I wonder, you can find that at music.podshow.com.

1221
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,160
Love that, it's really, it's nice.

1222
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:35,760
It's something different too, it's polished yet, it's not over polished, it's beautiful, really

1223
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:36,960
really like it, an Adley Brown.

1224
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:37,960
Very cool.

1225
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:45,440
I wish you guys, I wish we had Smello Rama on the source code because my wife just came in.

1226
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,000
You can hear, that's tin foil, let me tell you what she just brought me.

1227
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:55,360
She brought me two avocados, I've got to love her, two avocados, so sliced half avocados

1228
01:01:55,360 --> 01:02:01,240
with shrimp and cocktail sauce, and each package in its own individual little boat

1229
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,040
of tin foil.

1230
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:07,840
We've been married for 20 years, ladies and gentlemen, how cool is that?

1231
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:11,560
Another Pod Show Pod guest, stick it in your ear!
