00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 3-8-6

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hi Adam, how was it?

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Just catching up on a few daily source codes.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm going over behind.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And I just want to call and say thank you for the podcast, man.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's brilliant and this is the Friday morning.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm walking home with work through the summary London and I can't really see any better way

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
of starting a weekend than yeah.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah, I'm going to go into my ears and enjoying it.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Thank you, man.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Bye bye.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's not all that she thought it was.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's out on the right.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's all down.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Every time you come around and tell me all the things you do.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But these are cheese.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll be ready to regret that you will stay the same,

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
unless you just not get it through.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:19,000
In the morning sun, I roll the fat blood just to wake me up.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Sometimes I find it's hard to understand the way it can.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's out on the right.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's all down.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Every time you come around and tell me all the things you do.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
These things are cheese.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll be ready to regret that you will stay the same,

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
unless you just not get it through.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's out on the right.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's all down.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Every time you come around and tell me all the things you do.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
These things are cheese.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'll be ready to regret that you will stay the same,

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
unless you just not get it through.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The link is in the morning sun.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I started up, woke up, rolled up a flat, was it fat blood?

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
How can you go wrong with the song like that?

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's Friday, everybody.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
How you doing?

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Coming to you from Curry Cottage, another beautiful day in the United Kingdom.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It is the Daily Source Code, the Friday festivities,

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
got some cool music lined up.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We're going to keep it light today, some funny stuff.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I cannot believe I didn't open up phone lines much, much earlier in the show.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm enjoying this so much.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Actually, I do know why I didn't do it.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It is because you couldn't get a reliable MP3 email to you.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The quality was always crap.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Now, the quality is always going to be crap with a phone call, of course.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But this J2 connect service that I'm using.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
They email it to me in a format.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The quick time understands.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I was able to write a little apple script.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So when it comes in, it just converts it to an MP3,

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and I can drag it right into my show prep outline.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And I'm loving it.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's so fun to hear what everybody has to say.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If you want to call in, and this is, of course,

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
it's listeners who are calling, which I love hearing from podcasters.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
They've always got something very astute to say as well, or most of the time.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And always get their plug in.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But it's so cool when listeners who have no desire to be a part of podcasting,

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
just are enjoying what we're doing.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's what really turns me on.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
A number of New Jersey, 201, 625, 6357 in the United Kingdom in London,

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
O2076, 813753.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Actually, I'm doing that wrong.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
How do they say that here?

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
O207, 61813753.

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I think that's, I'm listening to all the different radio stations here.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Trying to pick up as much local slang, which is possible.

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Wow, it totally feels back to your topic that you've been discussing about describing

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
breast and the masculine.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You know, this is quite disturbing trend I have to say.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I have received at least five different voice mails talking about guys who name their

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
women's breasts.

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You know, actual names.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I had a girlfriend in high school and we used to call her a skill and tech.

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And let me tell you we had many x ones again.

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Anyway, nice listening.

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I really enjoyed it. Keep it up.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'll see you subscribe.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Alright, buddy. Thank you very much.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Now we're from our sponsor.

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's the yanks.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is the Brits.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We'll drive each other crazy, but everybody knows that it's a parent to see.

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
They're just like you and me.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's the yanks and the Brits.

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The yanks versus the Brits.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Mind the gap.

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
On our continuing journey to investigate the true differences between the yanks and the

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Brits, we find a call for help.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Good morning, Adam.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I've just listened to the Charlie from Bayer.

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So I'll go.

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is Logan and Southwest Florida.

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm going to have to do some flying.

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And I was thinking of a second that you could do on what to.

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I have to lead the country to do flying.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I've never been outside the country in that 50.

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm not exactly crazy about flying.

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I was wondering if you could get chips on how not to be an ugly American when you go

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
overseas.

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And what type of electric they use, what adapters do I need, all these types of issues.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Just a thought.

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Anyway, a lot of it when Patricia's on with you, man.

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You are so married.

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And by the way, I have the same problem with the night's.

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's do.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Just think of it as male, metapods.

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You'll be okay.

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Calculator five.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, okay.

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So you didn't say where you were flying to, but I'm just going to presume you're

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
flying to Britain.

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So I hope you are.

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And hopefully we can get some information from our British friends and fellows and listeners

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
who can tell us exactly what really irks them when you're walking around as a tourist.

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And all that other stuff.

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's pretty easy.

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You can get a lonely planet guide and figure out what adaptor you need.

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That's easy enough.

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And a shoot.

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Just go to any store at the airport.

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And they'll the point in the right place.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But really, it's about the behavior.

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I am, I too am very interested in that.

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
More about the night sweats in a second, as well as we continue with one more piece here in our

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yanks versus the Brits.

135
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Alex McCordys sent me an email.

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Which he thought would be entertaining.

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's actually he says sorry, just the final audio contribution which I found entertaining

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
might rock a few DSC listeners who've now found themselves in a chilled space of calm and relaxation

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
thanks to your brain wave generator.

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah.

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I think I've given people the permanent migraines.

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
A sales call on this piece of audio that shows that Brits can actually get riled and

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
an angry and dump a lightness right out the window.

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You Yanks will love this.

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
This is someone from British Telecom, a telemarketer calling.

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And the recipient of the call is also British and not happy.

147
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What the hell do you want?

148
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We're calling today to ensure you're getting the best vangiven service.

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Beat your corner for them.

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Fucking horn, call up your pissin' ass and get me off this.

151
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's an extra friendly horn, an alcohol.

152
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Fucking British Telecom.

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Okay, say that fucking bell now.

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Get that fuck up my phone line.

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Deal, all the time.

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I understand, sir.

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That's good.

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We're making it.

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
We're making it.

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And now we're making it.

161
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We're making it again.

162
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I wanna ride our carmen.

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
When you're calling it, fucking neck.

164
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And I'm in.

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Typically nobody will copy it.

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yeah.

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll only take it.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're a couple of seconds.

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, don't go.

170
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And fuck up.

171
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
No, fuck up.

172
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
No, come on.

173
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We end.

174
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah, no problem.

175
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Thank you.

176
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Don't.

177
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You're dead.

178
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Again.

179
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Right.

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Thank you for your time, sir.

181
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Thank you for using these things.

182
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Thank you.

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I got it.

184
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Jesus Christ, Diane.

185
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Could you do me a favor?

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Listen, sir.

187
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Let's call for me.

188
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Of course.

189
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Diane, could you leave me a favor?

190
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Listen, let's call for me, please.

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I must say that we got a lot of telemarketers when we just installed our phone line.

192
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And indeed, a lot of it is British Telecom trying to get you a better deal.

193
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And when you say, look, I'm just not interested in whatever you have to say.

194
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't have any time right now.

195
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
They're truly surprised.

196
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But it'll cost you less money.

197
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't care.

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Leave.

199
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And please take my name off your list.

200
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I have found that when you ask that, they really do take it off the list.

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The bank.

202
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Barclays.

203
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Also, they were calling all the time.

204
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And then finally, I turned around and said, OK, I'll take your damn savings account offer,

205
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
whatever.

206
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But then you need to go fix the following things for me.

207
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And he did.

208
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So it does.

209
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah, some of it really works well.

210
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But this clearly pissed this guy off to no end.

211
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Back to the night sweats for a second.

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Hey, Adam, it's Kelly, a listener from Malibu, California.

213
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I was just listening to the Charlie from Tuesday.

214
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And I wanted to comment about something you mentioned on a lecture,

215
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
sexual moment.

216
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It was about night sweats.

217
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You know what?

218
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's not just the guy thing.

219
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Throughout my adult life, I have gotten them just completely randomly.

220
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Might have at one night and not have it again four months.

221
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But I can wake up and be totally drenched.

222
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And I have to go get a towel to put down on the bed.

223
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So I have something to dry the lion.

224
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Of course, my husband thinks it's totally wacky.

225
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But I have no explanation.

226
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's just the way I am.

227
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So I just want to pass that along.

228
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Keep up the good work.

229
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Let the show love Patricia.

230
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Bye.

231
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Thanks, Kelly.

232
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You know, I think we've hit on something here.

233
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This is not a small problem.

234
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
We could actually start a club.

235
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I can just see the public service announcements now.

236
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Millions of Americans suffer from night sweats.

237
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Just to actually had a thought about that.

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm sorry for not putting this in Tuesday show comments.

239
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But I'm hoping you'll see this.

240
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Just listening to Tuesday's episode discussing your body overheating problem.

241
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah, the spontaneous combustion.

242
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I had the same issue.

243
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And the thing I found the problem was me being dehydrated.

244
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So the coffee and the splits would certainly hydrate.

245
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Drink plenty of water.

246
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And it will bring you in Patricia together.

247
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So I've been taking everybody's advice.

248
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I've been wearing boxers and wife beaters to bed.

249
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
No problem at all getting the sleep.

250
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I thought I would never be able to get to sleep wearing clothes.

251
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But that's actually working.

252
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And I tried to hide the hydrating bit.

253
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Drank three big glasses of water before I went to bed.

254
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Actually, even since wearing the boxers.

255
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I haven't had any problems at all.

256
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Hold on a second.

257
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Sorry.

258
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't have time for that.

259
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Whatever it is.

260
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Just interrupted my train of thought.

261
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Okay.

262
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Well, it seems like more people have this.

263
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And that seems to be a pretty good fix.

264
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But what it comes from?

265
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I don't know.

266
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I know there's doctors listening.

267
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'd love to get some insight in some analysis.

268
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Just to why this happens.

269
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Is this a direct result of the brain processing information?

270
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm sure Patricia has also said that.

271
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You know, my brain has to do a lot at night.

272
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
As true.

273
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Is that a part of it?

274
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Is it actually a symptom of spontaneous combustion?

275
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Let me know.

276
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Please.

277
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Voice mail.

278
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And I still can't figure out how to get a message on there.

279
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So if you just hear some recorded message saying leave your message.

280
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You got you're at the right place.

281
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
201.

282
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
65.

283
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
65.

284
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Or 0207.

285
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
681.

286
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
3753.

287
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That's if you're in London.

288
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Hey, Adam.

289
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
This is Darren from Southern California.

290
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I just wanted to say that.

291
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I love your show.

292
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I've been an avid listener of the DSC since about January 2005.

293
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And hey, whatever happened to the drum cadence of the day.

294
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah, that's a good question, man.

295
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:11,000
In the beginning, I found that just about everyone in America certainly has been in a marching drum band, usually at high school.

296
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And we had a little segment called the drum cadence of the day.

297
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I think we're pretty tapped out on that.

298
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But if anyone has a great cadence, you know, of course.

299
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'd love to hear it.

300
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Love that stuff.

301
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Well, anyway, just wanted to tell you about a great experience I had over it.

302
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And before I also, there's another issue there.

303
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
A lot of the songs weren't pod safe, so that people playing hits.

304
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But you can't play it.

305
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Okay, so I think you're going to say you're over at Curry Castle in second life.

306
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The castle in second life.

307
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I was hanging out at the castle this morning, chatting some of the visitors and talking to this one guy about Jim Kramer's mad money.

308
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
He's a show on CNBC.

309
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And what do you know, this guy that does the mad money machine podcast?

310
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I work in the finance industry, but haven't had a chance to check it any financial podcasts.

311
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So about 10 minutes after this happened, I went over to iTunes, found this podcast, and then hit subscribe.

312
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So podcast, you get to new subscriber, and I, and listener, get a new podcast.

313
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's a cool podcast, by the way, check it out sometime.

314
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And I'm sure this is all part of what you're doing there in second life.

315
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And I got to tell you, man, it totally works.

316
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So thanks again for what you're doing in second life.

317
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And more importantly, thanks for what you're doing in real life.

318
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And I hope to see you soon.

319
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Thank you.

320
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
That's really sweet.

321
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Thank you.

322
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I appreciate that.

323
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Isn't that nice?

324
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Most importantly, thank you for what you're doing in real life.

325
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That's nice.

326
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Of course.

327
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm going to take two minutes to finish right now.

328
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Second life, man.

329
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What is all this stuff?

330
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Is that a thing?

331
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,500
Because one of the cool things fans but I've got so little fun stuff.

332
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,500
All we really do is you can easily hold the eels.

333
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,500
But they won't just stay even more busy and stuff, but it's better to stay.

334
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,000
And simple things.

335
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,500
So what is all this stuff?

336
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,000
No, watch it all right, man.

337
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,900
I just hold your part and you have fun.

338
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,900
It's better to do it all right.

339
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,900
Right, the castle is closed,

340
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,900
but it's a huge lie.

341
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,900
I'm adding it.

342
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,900
It's crazy.

343
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,900
Jeff Smith, you're genius.

344
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,900
I think I've got it figured out.

345
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,900
Yes, I do.

346
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,900
Because what you just said about meeting someone at the castle,

347
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
now it's all come together.

348
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,900
Finally, I see it.

349
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,900
And if you haven't tried it,

350
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,900
maybe if I explained it in this manner,

351
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,900
you'll understand better what's going on.

352
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,900
First of all, we're very accustomed to using internet technologies for

353
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:53,900
asynchronous or synchronous communication.

354
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,900
So an example, but podcasting is asynchronous.

355
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,900
I make it, you hear it some other time,

356
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,900
whenever it's convenient for you.

357
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,900
Which, of course, is a revolution in media,

358
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,900
just all by itself.

359
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,900
Then we have email, which is also a synchronous by nature,

360
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,900
which was a revolution.

361
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,900
And now, of course, some people like myself hate

362
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,900
because it's an open,

363
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,900
it's an open hole in my communication life where anything

364
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,900
and everyone can get through,

365
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,900
unfortunately, because it's that way,

366
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,900
the opportunity and all the other crab come at the same time.

367
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,900
So we don't have to talk about that now.

368
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,900
Then a chat, which we've been using for many, many years.

369
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,900
And the culture of chat, if you have kids,

370
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,900
look at what they're doing with MSN,

371
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,900
they're probably on MSN or on Yahoo or on AOL,

372
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,900
Instant Messenger, or all three at the same time,

373
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,900
very possible.

374
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,900
Excuse me, Sensei.

375
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,900
At the office, we use Skype,

376
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,900
because we use Skype as a communications tool for voice a lot.

377
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,900
And therefore, it's usually everyone has it open,

378
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,900
and that's kind of the office.

379
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,900
Oh, quite excuse me.

380
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,900
That's the office, Instant Message System.

381
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,900
I see second life in my real life.

382
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,900
Almost no different than show notes,

383
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,900
or no different from comments at curry.com.

384
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,900
We have ongoing conversations about stuff discussed in the show,

385
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,900
which doesn't necessarily make it back into the show.

386
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,900
Some of it does.

387
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,900
Now, that, of course, is asynchronous by nature.

388
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,900
You can always check in and see other conversations.

389
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,900
But when you really want to chat with someone,

390
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,900
and by the way, marketing executives used to cream over the idea of

391
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,900
having a celebrity in a chat room.

392
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,900
It still happens.

393
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,900
It's the AOL, this is all the time,

394
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,900
and it's very, very successful.

395
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,900
You know, an author, a musician, an actor,

396
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,900
some real life form of celebrity shows up

397
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,900
in this cyber area, cyber life,

398
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,900
where you get queued up, and you can chat,

399
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,900
and you can ask questions.

400
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,900
And, of course, you're not in the same physical location,

401
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,900
but you probably never would have that opportunity anyway.

402
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,900
So, it's only enhancing to what you didn't have, I guess,

403
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,900
because you are actually communicating with that person.

404
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,900
So, it's the same thing.

405
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,900
In second life, which is this virtual world

406
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,900
for those of you just hearing about it for the first time,

407
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,900
when you log in there,

408
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,900
you can do a lot of stuff that emulates real life.

409
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,900
You can build things, you can buy land,

410
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,900
you can interact with people,

411
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,900
but a lot of it is really based on chat,

412
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,900
and it's slightly done.

413
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,900
But a lot of it, I think, is also a platform

414
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,900
for communication.

415
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,900
I'll get to that in a second.

416
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,900
What is the main difference here?

417
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,900
As a pilot, you develop a skill,

418
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,900
maybe it's almost a sense,

419
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,900
but let's call it a skill called situational awareness.

420
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,900
And situational awareness, you may not realize this,

421
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,900
but the windows in the cockpit really aren't used

422
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,900
that much in flight.

423
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
They're important for landing,

424
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,900
certainly, to get your bearings to the runway, et cetera.

425
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,900
But really, it's the reverse of driving a car,

426
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,900
where in the car, you're looking at the road,

427
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
looking at your mirrors, looking at all the other idiots,

428
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,900
make sure you don't bump into anything.

429
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,900
And once in a while you make glance at your instruments,

430
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,900
usually the speedometer see how fast you're going.

431
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
And there's warning lights and stuff,

432
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,900
if your petrol is low or your oil,

433
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,900
you know how that works.

434
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,900
So, it's the reverse in an airplane,

435
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,900
where you're really looking at the instruments,

436
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,900
and as a part of your scan of the instruments,

437
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,900
you'll also scan the outside,

438
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,900
you'll scan your whole peripheral view of what's going on in the sky.

439
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,900
But because of the radio communications you have,

440
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,900
and remember, this is just,

441
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,900
it's a form of chat.

442
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,900
And in fact, the way we talk on the radio and aviation

443
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,900
is just like chat except it's all in a book.

444
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,900
You know, so we know what we're going to say,

445
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,900
and we know what the response should be,

446
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,900
and we understand.

447
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,900
And it's oftentimes, and I do that a lot,

448
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,900
you'll break the format.

449
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,900
So, for instance, if I'm leaving raw,

450
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,900
if I'm arriving at Rotterdam Airport,

451
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,900
and I haven't done Rotterdam more than three, four times in my life.

452
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,900
And, you know, sometimes I'll have to ask something like,

453
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,900
okay, look, I think I'm over Oscar reporting point,

454
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,900
just could you just confirm that.

455
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,900
And the tower will jump in and help.

456
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,900
And then when I land, you know,

457
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,900
after I said that I vacated the runway,

458
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,900
you know, I'll usually say something in Dutch,

459
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,900
and I'll thank the controller for helping me out,

460
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,900
and you kind of break format.

461
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,900
And people do that all the time.

462
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,900
But it is a very strict means of communication,

463
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,900
and it gives us a lot of information in the air

464
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,900
as to what else is going on, who else is in the air,

465
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,900
and where they are.

466
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,900
So, you kind of have this mental image of every single aircraft

467
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,900
in the vicinity of where you are and what you're doing,

468
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,900
and actually far beyond that,

469
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,900
depending on what you're doing and where you are

470
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,900
and what you're what frequency you're on.

471
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,900
And it's funny because you develop this mental image,

472
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,900
and if I had radar on board,

473
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,900
the force is way too expensive for an aircraft.

474
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,900
Like this, you know,

475
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,900
I could actually see that situation around me.

476
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,900
But you still, as a pilot, you get trained,

477
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,900
and you have this situation on awareness.

478
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,900
And that's what it is in the second life.

479
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,900
Because unlike chat,

480
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,900
when I'm chatting to a couple of people at the office,

481
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,900
I actually know where they're sitting.

482
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,900
I don't know if they're sitting there at that moment,

483
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,900
but I know where they're sitting,

484
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,900
so I have a mental image,

485
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,900
and I have some situation on awareness.

486
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,900
Sometimes actually in a place where you can see it,

487
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,900
then the conversation becomes much more natural.

488
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,900
People who want just want to listen in,

489
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,900
will stand back a little bit.

490
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,900
People who want to break off the conversation

491
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,900
can actually move away,

492
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,900
if they move away far enough,

493
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,900
that chat will no longer cross over into my view.

494
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,900
And there's also,

495
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,900
people express themselves with different gestures.

496
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,900
And it's just a part of your personality,

497
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,900
which really, really helps.

498
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,900
The way someone has decided to dress themselves up

499
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,900
in a virtual world does tell you a bit about their personality,

500
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,900
the same as it does in real life.

501
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,900
So, for me,

502
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,900
it's an extension of this situational awareness

503
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,900
that I already,

504
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,900
well, I don't really have it.

505
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,900
You see, I think that's why I'm so interested in it,

506
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,900
because I hear feedback from people.

507
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,900
Now when they say,

508
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,900
when I get a voice mail saying,

509
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,900
hey, I'm walking on the streets of London,

510
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,900
got it, you know,

511
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,900
got a mental image,

512
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,900
no problem at all.

513
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,900
But if it's just comments from people,

514
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,900
you really don't,

515
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,900
there's less of a connection there.

516
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,900
And it's much harder to keep a multi-voice conversation going.

517
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,900
So when you bring all this together,

518
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,900
and my expression, of course,

519
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,900
is that I'm seven feet, six inches tall in second life.

520
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,900
And I have a castle where people come and hang out,

521
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,900
and I've got all kinds of place to sit

522
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,900
and to hang, and last night,

523
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,900
I tried to drop by twice a day,

524
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,900
usually early in the morning here,

525
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
so I can clean up whatever crap was left overnight,

526
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,900
and I can change and modify stuff,

527
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,900
because once you get like 50 people

528
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,900
in your general area,

529
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,900
the system really slows down.

530
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,900
You just can't do much more,

531
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,900
and you can't edit stuff,

532
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,900
and move stuff around,

533
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,900
let alone replace the castle,

534
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,900
which I did yesterday morning.

535
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,900
So last night,

536
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,900
I had a call on 11 o'clock with a pod show call,

537
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,900
which was also cool, by the way,

538
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,900
about that earthly stuff,

539
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,900
getting very close to that.

540
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,900
And so after that, I figured I'd check in,

541
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,900
and so I'd drop in,

542
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,900
and there's probably 15, 20 people on the roof of the castle,

543
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,900
and a lot of them were listeners,

544
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,900
and here's how it goes.

545
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,900
Hey, Adam, how you doing?

546
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,900
I'm a listener.

547
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,900
I've never been in second life.

548
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,900
I came in because I heard about it on your show,

549
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,900
and then we have maybe it'll be a comment.

550
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,900
Lots of people saying nice things about my mom,

551
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,900
wishing her well,

552
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,900
and it's really nice.

553
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,900
And for some reason, it just works.

554
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,900
Then I have that situational awareness.

555
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,900
People understand if I'm not typing back for a second,

556
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,900
because my avatar will actually walk over somewhere else.

557
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,900
It works.

558
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,900
It really does.

559
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,900
So it's not something that I want to get completely immersed

560
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,900
in on the level that some might,

561
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,900
but I can definitely see a use for it.

562
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,900
Oh, shoot.

563
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,900
Right in the middle of something good, too.

564
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,900
Always here to spoil the fun.

565
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,900
I'm a satellite repair man.

566
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,900
I'm coming after you.

567
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,900
I'm a satellite repair man.

568
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,900
What's he gonna do?

569
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,900
He'll fix your misconceptions,

570
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,900
and answer questions, too.

571
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,900
There's nothing in the universe

572
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,900
and he can't do for you.

573
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,900
A satellite repair man.

574
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,900
A satellite repair man.

575
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,900
Here I go.

576
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,900
Show.

577
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,900
Which means satellite listener series stars 102.

578
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,900
That's it for the show for you.

579
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,900
Download our data source code.com.

580
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,900
We'll see you back on Monday.

581
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,900
PCH is next.

582
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,900
And we'll just continue a little bit on the second life.

583
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,900
Because last night,

584
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,900
it's too bad the satellite folks can't hear this.

585
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,900
Last night, a listener from the UK drop by.

586
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,900
Her name is Emma.

587
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,900
And I'd never met Emma before.

588
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,900
Now, Emma has actually been listening to the Charlie.

589
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,900
What did she say?

590
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,900
Since January 2005 or something.

591
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,900
So almost a year and a half.

592
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,900
Excuse me.

593
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,900
I'm sorry.

594
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,900
She's exactly what I was talking about.

595
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,900
Oh, man.

596
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,900
It's Friday.

597
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,900
You can tell.

598
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,900
I'm done.

599
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,900
I'm fried.

600
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,900
I'm toast.

601
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,900
So she said, you know, I heard you talking about this thing.

602
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,900
So I figured to come check it out.

603
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,900
Emma, totally, totally let loose.

604
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,900
She's putting on a ripped t-shirt, a wet t-shirt,

605
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,900
put on a pod show t-shirt, was dancing around.

606
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,900
And of course, I got my, my, my CDs out.

607
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,900
And none of this pod safe.

608
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,900
And I'll talk about that in the sec.

609
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,900
And, you know, we just started jamming.

610
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,900
And then she said, oh, I need a stripper pole.

611
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,900
Well, I tell the ported out.

612
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,900
And this was telling us a lot about Emma.

613
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,900
I tell the ported out.

614
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,900
Got a stripper pole.

615
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,900
And she started dancing on it.

616
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,900
And then I threw down the dance pad.

617
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,900
And everyone was, and people generally were having a good time.

618
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,900
I can't make it up.

619
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,900
And, you know, and these are, you know,

620
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,900
people who listen to financial, who work in financial industry.

621
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,900
You know, doctors, lawyers, goofballs,

622
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,900
losers, winners.

623
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,900
Everything was there.

624
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,900
We just danced.

625
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,900
And having a good time.

626
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,900
And all the while kind of chatting along.

627
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,900
And much to my happiness this morning.

628
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,900
A voice mail from Emma.

629
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,900
Hello, big boys.

630
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,900
This is, I'm not nasty to go.

631
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,900
You may dance a little pole for your pleasure.

632
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,900
Last night.

633
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,900
You bad boy.

634
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,900
I hope we can do it again sometime out of.

635
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,900
Oh, understand.

636
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,900
I promise not to grab your cock and public.

637
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,900
So technically, you didn't.

638
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,900
And technically, you can't.

639
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,900
I've turned all that stuff off.

640
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,900
So you can't just access that area of my avatar.

641
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,900
But it told me a lot about how you were thinking Emma.

642
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,900
Okay.

643
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,900
But you touched my ass and then that got all excited.

644
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,900
So I forget about that.

645
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,900
You know, I know because I had some private conversation with Emma.

646
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,900
She would never be like that in real life.

647
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,900
But I think that she really let loose.

648
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,900
And she like being the center of the party for a little while there.

649
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,900
And it was fun if we really had a good time.

650
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,900
Okay.

651
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,900
So here's, um, getting positive music into the system.

652
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,900
And this is just a little tin foil hat moment.

653
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,900
Oh, oh, Jeff Smith.

654
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,900
Oh, Jeff.

655
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,900
I can, I think I want to commission that one.

656
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,900
A tin foil hat moment or something like that.

657
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,900
We've got to think about that.

658
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,900
Oh, that's a good one.

659
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,900
The way, so you can, so you can set a streaming URL.

660
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,900
So that anywhere within a parcel of land,

661
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,900
you will, everyone will hear the same stream.

662
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,900
Now, I, I like that because it's pretty reliable and it'll work for concerts.

663
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,900
But I don't like it for just playing something in the world.

664
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,900
And the way you do that is you can actually play way files.

665
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,900
And so I figured out a script, which, uh,

666
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,900
now the way files are limited to 10 seconds each.

667
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,900
That's all you can upload into second life, which, of course,

668
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,900
bites major ass.

669
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,900
So, um, so I, so I figured out if I upload a song and

670
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,900
chop it into like 30 10 second bits, um,

671
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,900
then I can have those play in sequence.

672
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,900
What's nice about it is if you walk away from the source that's playing,

673
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,900
it'll get softer if you walk closer gets louder.

674
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,900
And so it's, it's a, it's a much more real, uh, vibe to it.

675
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,900
So if anyone out there can, is it either an apple script or anything else

676
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,900
that'll run on the mac, you know, of course,

677
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,900
some unique thing will be fine too.

678
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:41,900
I need an easy way to just drop an MP3 file into a folder onto a,

679
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,900
script icon or whatever.

680
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,900
And have it automatically be chopped up into, um,

681
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,900
uh, 10 second bits in waveform.

682
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,900
And then ideally, of course, from there, upload automatically into my

683
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,900
accounted second life, but I guess I'll have to do that manually.

684
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,900
Then I can import it into an object and make it play.

685
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,900
It's a horribly, horribly tedious process,

686
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,900
not cheap because it costs you 20,

687
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,900
linden dollars to upload every sound.

688
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,900
But I, I, I really want to experiment with that.

689
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,900
And I just don't have the patience to go through trying to

690
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,900
script that and, and cutting it manually into,

691
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,900
into all those pieces, forget about it.

692
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,900
Okay, so that's it for second life.

693
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,900
And Emma, thank you so much for sending that in.

694
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,900
I, I really appreciate it.

695
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,900
Nice to meet you.

696
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,900
Come back anytime now.

697
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,900
Yeah.

698
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,900
Come extra.

699
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,900
Come extra.

700
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,900
Come extra.

701
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,900
Come extra.

702
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,900
Come extra.

703
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,900
Come extra.

704
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,900
Come extra.

705
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,900
Come extra.

706
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,900
Come extra.

707
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,900
Come extra.

708
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,900
Come extra.

709
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,900
Come extra.

710
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,900
You see?

711
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,900
Or should I say controversy?

712
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,920
Between comics, drip blogger and Roger Smalls.

713
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,900
Now, we heard yesterday from Roger Smalls who is back,

714
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,900
that he was really, really upset with comics, drip blogger.

715
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,900
And I saw on thecurry.com comments,

716
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,900
CSB had posted an entire apology,

717
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,900
and it doesn't stop there.

718
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,900
I, I'm carry.

719
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,900
I would like to apologize to Roger Smalls publicly.

720
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,900
That's true that I have drawn a comic strip,

721
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,900
where it was suggested that Roger is not

722
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:14,260
Roger is not meeting up with you, Adam, Kerry, because Roger is ugly and all shy.

723
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:20,680
I apologize for that, and I have just removed the part of this comic strip where Roger

724
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:29,660
was featured, albeit as fictional character called Roger Squalls, not as Roger Smalls.

725
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,260
Anyway, I was wrong.

726
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:37,260
You are one handsome, handsome, handsome Roger, you are not ugly, you are beautiful,

727
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,260
Roger.

728
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,260
Okay.

729
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:48,260
So, the other smalls, please accept my apology, so remade, peace, okay?

730
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:56,060
Finally, anybody who is offended by any of my comic strips or by any of my tabloids

731
00:30:56,060 --> 00:31:02,420
style writings, please contact me directly, and I will remove related pieces that are

732
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,420
offending you.

733
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:10,780
I will accept, however, requests only from people depicted, not from sad parties.

734
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:18,620
Legendary of this, sometimes people like art or publicity about themselves, no matter

735
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,260
whether it is good or bad.

736
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:26,020
According to the motto, there is no such thing as bad publicity.

737
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,460
So, have a nice weekend, Adam, Kerry.

738
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:35,340
I wish you, sincerely, a good health to your whole, whole, family.

739
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,340
Ciao, Adam.

740
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,340
Bye.

741
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,340
Yeah.

742
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:43,060
People say to me, why did you do the comic strip blogger?

743
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,060
You know what?

744
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,780
I just treated him like any other person who shows up at the Daily Source Code front door,

745
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,900
and lo and behold, there is a pretty nice intelligent guy underneath all that rough

746
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,900
exterior.

747
00:31:52,980 --> 00:32:00,420
Now, unfortunately, Roger hasn't heard this public apology because he sent me something

748
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,860
this morning before I did the show.

749
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:09,260
So he may have changed his feelings about you there, CSB, after what he just heard, but

750
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,140
as of this morning, he was definitely definitely not pleased.

751
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,140
Let's listen.

752
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,500
Hey, Adam, Roger, here.

753
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,620
I heard that one of your listeners mentioned on last week's show, that's the international

754
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,780
masturbation months at the moment.

755
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,780
Now, not sure how this works, does it mean I get to enjoy myself for this month, but

756
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,220
then have to wait 11 months before I get to square my care again.

757
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,380
And can you explain?

758
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,380
Wait a minute.

759
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,380
What did you say?

760
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,100
Wait 11 months into what?

761
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:40,140
How for this month, but then have to wait 11 months before I get to square my care

762
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,140
again.

763
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,140
Oh, Roger.

764
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,780
Did you actually say, Scort my curd?

765
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,580
Can you explain this, please?

766
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,180
Thank you.

767
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:56,060
I want to say put the send you some songs in about masturbation and I found something.

768
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:00,180
Hey, you know, I think there was a, wasn't there a piece about comics, Drew?

769
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,180
I don't know.

770
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,180
Is this yesterday's piece?

771
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:06,180
I don't know what they had I'm doing.

772
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,180
Now I'm all confused.

773
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,180
Hold on.

774
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,180
Is this still the masturbation?

775
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,180
Yeah.

776
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,180
I won't care.

777
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,180
Hold on.

778
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:16,180
Just say this.

779
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:25,180
That's the song about wanking.

780
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:30,180
Yeah, this is the one he sent me.

781
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,180
That's right.

782
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:34,180
It says one person who knows about easing the loneliness of an empty life.

783
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,180
He's come to the nano magazine.

784
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,180
Then it's the comic strip blogger.

785
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,180
I don't think it's international masturbation month within now.

786
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:45,180
I think it's more like international masturbation 52 years.

787
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,180
Because I think that guy's been a tougher all his life.

788
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,180
I'm sorry to say.

789
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,180
It's also like the man.

790
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:52,180
Don't agree with his policies or creed.

791
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,180
Bye for now and happy masturbating.

792
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,180

Yo, right off.

806
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,180
Sorry about that.

807
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,180
I was queuing something up until I had the mic open.

808
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:53,180
Um, okay, pod save music now.

809
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,180
Uh, what was I going to say?

810
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,180
Something else.

811
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,180
Who knows?

812
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,180
It's Friday.

813
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,180
Who cares?

814
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,180
It's not important.

815
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,180
Hey Adam says J Murphy, knowing your affection for cowbell.

816
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:09,180
There is a great blue song at the pod save music network that has plenty of cowbell.

817
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:14,180
Remember by Bob Kirkpatrick from top cat records.

818
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,180
Think it's just right to your Friday party vibe.

819
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,180
When suddenly I played it on Murphy's saloon episode number 23.

820
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,180
Thank you very much, Murphy.

821
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,180
Dude, you are so right.

822
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:29,180
I think I need to break out my own cowbell.

823
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,180
From the pod save music network, Bob Kirkpatrick.

824
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,180
Remember, baby.

825
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:45,180
Remember, I'll feel to feel alone.

826
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:52,180
Remember, I'll feel to feel alone.

827
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,180
You wake up.

828
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,180
Wake up and find me going.

829
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:01,180
Listen to me to me.

830
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,180
Listen to me to me.

831
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:08,180
I'll handle the ball of blood.

832
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:12,180
Listen to me to you.

833
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:17,180
I'll handle the ball of blood.

834
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,180
Don't cry.

835
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:22,180
Baby, it's your time, though.

836
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,180
Now I'm going back home

837
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,180
I'm going home

838
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,180
Now I'm going back home

839
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,180
The way you don't get sick is

840
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,180
I'll be better off alone

841
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,180
With no fun

842
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,680
I'll feel you feel home

843
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,680
The way you don't get sick

844
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,680
I'll feel you feel home

845
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,680
And you'll wake up

846
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,680
Wake up and find me go

847
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,680
Oh yeah

848
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,680
Remember from Bob Kirkpatrick

849
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,680
A name that is hard to mess up

850
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,680
But sometimes I do

851
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,680
Hey Adam, this is not a big break podcast

852
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,680
Coming from New York from Charleston, South Carolina

853
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,680
I was just listening to the Charlie 3-5

854
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,680
And just want to make a comment

855
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,680
Sophia Romos, she pronounced it

856
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,680
Romos rather than Ramos

857
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,680
I did the same thing first time I played her music

858
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,680
If you get a chance, check out my show The Big Break

859
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,680
On www.lowcountryradio.com

860
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,680
I did an interview with Sophia

861
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,680
A few weeks back

862
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,680
We're going to interview you

863
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,680
So you might want to check that out

864
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,680
Love you, show

865
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,680
www.lowcountryradio.com

866
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,680
Yeah, thank you

867
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,680
And it's important I want to say this stuff right

868
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,680
And of course, all the songs played on the daily source code

869
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,680
Become available for purchase to the pod save music network

870
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,680
Once they're played, if the artist agrees of course

871
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,680
That's how we're slowly rolling this out

872
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,680
And I think we'll start accelerating in the next week or so

873
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,680
It's music.podshow.com

874
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,680
And of course you can find all the links to the individual

875
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,680
Artists pages from the daily source code.com show notes

876
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,680
Or from curie.com where I post it as well

877
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,680
If you're on the pod show plus system, go

878
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,680
It's really there now in it

879
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,680
And the Jeff Smith, the guy is a genius

880
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,680
Talk about them all the time

881
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,680
He does all the whole bunch of songs and imaging and stuff

882
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,680
He can't throw a Jeff that he can't do

883
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,680
And all the time all the while he's spending his own time

884
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,680
Coming up with cool things and telling him to me

885
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,680
We pay him for some stuff when we ask him to do something

886
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,680
But he does a lot just because he's cool

887
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,680
But he did something tremendous yesterday

888
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,680
I think he has a

889
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,680
Two-year-old daughter

890
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,680
I don't know how old she is

891
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,680
She seems a little older in the video

892
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,680
Maybe she was three

893
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,680
I don't remember

894
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,680
I think that you are already set for when she's a teenager

895
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,680
Because you've got the psychology down my friend

896
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,680
I've tried Patricia's tried, listeners have tried

897
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,680
To get Christina to finally start with her show

898
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,680
She has the name for it, pod save the queen

899
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,680
Which I love the bits, pod save the queen

900
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,680
She has pod save the queen.com

901
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,680
She's got a show blog up there which she hasn't done anything to

902
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,680
She doesn't know how to edit WordPress and I understand that

903
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,680
And I said I'd get someone to help with that if she won

904
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,680
And of course she wants to do that herself

905
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,680
I got something yesterday from Jeff

906
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,680
And I knew that this would do it, this would push her over the edge

907
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,680
And she was on the phone with one of her friends

908
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,680
I said, come here, hold the phone up to the speakers

909
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,680
I want your friend to hear this as well

910
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,680
Because Jeff wrote her a theme song

911
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,680
I mean, what kid wouldn't be motivated to have their own piece of

912
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
I'd save the queen

913
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,680
Need something new

914
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,680
Before me and you

915
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,680
Don't make me wait

916
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,680
I owe my friend

917
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,680
I'm not saving the queen

918
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,680
Yeah

919
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,680
I'd save the queen

920
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,680
I know what I want

921
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,680
I know what I need

922
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,680
I know how to ask for it

923
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,680
Down on my knees

924
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,680
Everybody dance

925
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,680
No, no, no, no, no, no

926
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,480
None other one

927
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,680
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

928
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,680
Yeah

929
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,680
I'd save the queen

930
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,680
I'd save the queen

931
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:56,400
So, you can imagine Christina went nuts as did her friend on the other end of the line.

932
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,840
Of course, I'll cut it down to make it into a real intro, and she can use it as an outro

933
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
as well.

934
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,880
I'm pretty sure she's going to start now Jeff, I can't thank you enough.

935
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,840
And of course, we'll teach her about real-world economics because when she starts her

936
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,920
show, I'm going to tell her she has to pay for the use of that.

937
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,120
Now she can't afford the normal rates, but Jeff, you understand what I'm saying, right?

938
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:25,600
Well, she's just wanted to understand that there's social and financial reward, and it'll

939
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,280
be a good lesson for her, and she'll do it.

940
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,760
I know she will.

941
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,320
But first I'll get her started with the show, then I'll hit her with a bill, okay?

942
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,440
Hello Adam, this is Tokyo Dance on WhatsApp, I'm ending in Tokyo.

943
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,760
I noticed that you're opening up the podcast using network to musicians that you're playing

944
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,880
your show for payment.

945
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,840
I'd like to ask you to play Dike in Little Wing, sparkling woman.

946
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,440
It's a great reggae tune, you know, someone's coming up.

947
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:54,040
He's also got a great R&B tune up there called Dear Friend, that's Dike in Little Wing.

948
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:59,000
He's been up this year's, the end of December, so I think he'd really appreciate you playing

949
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,320
his song and opening it up for him.

950
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,040
Well, take it easy Adam, check that again.

951
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:09,640
Yo, Tokyo Dance, thank you so much, man, for turning me on to Dike.

952
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:16,440
This song is so fantastic, it was like Japanese music, it was mixed together with jazz and

953
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,440
reggae.

954
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,200
