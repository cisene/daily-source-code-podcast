94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,760
Suburb of Surrey, known as Guilford, crap weather today, my friends.

95
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,480
Let me turn on the exterior microphone here for a second.

96
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480
Oh, you can't hear it.

97
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,480
It's raining.

98
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,800
It's really pouring down today.

99
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,080
A perfect for a Friday.

100
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,280
So we've got the festivities ready to roll on the way.

101
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,760
Lots to talk about today.

102
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,040
One of the main topics that a lot of people respond to from yesterday is about NASA,

103
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:04,760
using misplacing the original footage of the moon landing amongst other things.

104
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,000
Now you know I'm a little bit skeptical about the actual landings that we are supposed

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,480
to have made on the moon.

106
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,000
And you certainly sent in your comments.

107
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:19,040
Hey Adam, it's Carlos again, I was just listening to DSC443 and you asked about NASA

108
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:26,720
losing the the original footage and the actual, yeah, the person to confirm that yeah, that

109
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
is true.

110
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:37,240
And they also have conveniently misplaced slushed out the original blueprints of the spacecraft

111
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,000
that allegedly flew to the moon.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay, bye.

113
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,920
Is that the ones that flew to the moon or the actual lunar module?

114
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,480
I had a great conversation about this with Captain Dan this morning.

115
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:55,640
Who, of course, does not subscribe to my theory.

116
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,160
So not only have they lost the tapes and I've read this several different reports and

117
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,960
you never know what you can believe, right?

118
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,160
I read one report that said that they had lost seven or misplaced, seven hundred boxes,

119
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,360
including the actual footage.

120
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,280
Now what I understand, the way this was done, now this is the early days of television.

121
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,920
And the way they actually did it is they broadcast a slow scan television signal apparently

122
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,440
from the moon, from the lunar module at about 10 frames per second.

123
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:33,080
That was a slow scan broadcast down to a monitor in Houston, in Mission Control.

124
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,080
And the television cameras were actually focused on the monitor itself.

125
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:45,320
So think about all the potential for, shall we say, monkey business that could go on

126
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,640
in that chain of events.

127
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,800
And it's just amazing to me that they've misplaced that.

128
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,160
Yeah, lots of people say it's, the blackberry out of the way.

129
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,240
Lots of people say, well, it happens with government organizations, but not with something

130
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
like this.

131
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,000
I still have my first episode that I was ever on television.

132
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,600
My own personal television moon landing.

133
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
I got that one.

134
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,920
I haven't lost it.

135
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Lost lots of other stuff.

136
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,640
But then again, I'm not NASA, you know, and how many billions do we pay these guys?

137
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,640
How many billions?

138
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
Hi, Adam.

139
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
My name's Andrew Gerven.

140
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,960
Did you know the item-profestible fridge or something?

141
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
A crap.

142
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
That's not what I wanted to play.

143
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
This is the one I wanted you to hear.

145
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,360
I'm calling in about the NASA losing the footage moon landing comment that was left.

146
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,520
And yeah, that's totally true.

147
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,520
Totally true.

148
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,600
And there are reports out that NASA has lost the original moon landing footage.

149
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,080
It doesn't do them any good if they were covering something up because there's copies.

150
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,720
Everyone on the internet at the footage.

151
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,920
But, you know, whatever's happened, they lost the footage, I sent you a link in the email

152
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
that's just coming through.

153
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,760
So just so you have that.

154
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,160
My question for you is, what are your grounds for thinking that the United States government

155
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,160
through NASA did not land any one on the moon?

156
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,560
Why do you suddenly, why are you along with all those conspiracy theorists out there

157
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,880
that say, oh, we never land it, you know, what's your reasoning?

158
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,880
Scruncher.

159
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,880
Okay.

160
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
Scruncher, of course.

161
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,960
Well, I'm not a natural born conspiracy theorist to be quite honest.

162
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,400
However, I am a television person.

163
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,880
I've been making television for more than half of my life.

164
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,600
And when I first started kind of reading about the so-called conspiracy, first of all,

165
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
it makes sense.

166
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,200
You have made sense at the time.

167
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,840
There was a lot going on between Russia and the United States.

168
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,560
The Russians had put Sputnik into space and we were behind and there was a big push

169
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:43,440
and a lot of pressure to basically outdo them for a number of political reasons at the time.

170
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,440
So, you know, if you take that into account and then you take into account how often you

171
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,160
are lied to and cheated through television.

172
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
And I know this.

173
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,440
This is what I know, and it's all minor stuff.

174
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,240
But boy, the times that we have lied to our audience, both in programs that I've made

175
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:10,600
for television networks in Europe, for MTV, basically every single production that I've

176
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,480
worked on, there's a lie somewhere along the way.

177
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,840
And you'll witness what's happened with these Reuters pictures, not just the Photoshop

178
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:24,960
job, but also, you know, a shot of a busted building and then a Mickey Mouse doll conveniently

179
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,640
placed right in front in the shot.

180
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,760
You know, these, these are lies.

181
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,480
These are things that are staged and are placed to evoke a certain emotion.

182
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,280
And of course to a list of certain response.

183
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,120
I think in many cases, it's not politically motivated, it is just a freelance photographer

184
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,320
who's trying to sell his shit.

185
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,360
And that's usually how those things happen.

186
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,920
But if you, I'll give an example, Janet Jackson, when she had, what was the song?

187
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,280
What have you done for me lately?

188
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,280
I was doing television in the Netherlands.

189
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,840
This is, I think, 82 or 83.

190
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,480
She sent out what is now common known as an EPK.

191
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,800
And echo Papakilo, electronic press kit.

192
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,440
And on that is, of course, a new video, and then an interview with Janet, but only

193
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,320
of Janet and the questions are nicely spaced.

194
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,640
So that you essentially can either take out a little clip of an answer of hers or, as

195
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,960
we did, we had a satellite link up with Janet Jackson.

196
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,080
And we even had a little bit of satellite static fuzz there, and then I had it perfectly

197
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,640
timed where I'd asked the questions, and then we'd switch over to the satellite feed

198
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,520
and Janet would answer.

199
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,600
These are lies that are done all the time, and it's so simple.

200
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:38,400
And particularly in those early days of television, I'm pretty sure that it was certainly

201
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:44,440
an option that was open to everyone, and whether it was true or not, that remains to

202
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,440
be seen.

203
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,080
It doesn't help that now all this footage is gone, because what do we have left?

204
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,720
We basically have the hoax that is left.

205
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,920
Could someone please answer the phone?

206
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,160
Please?

207
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,440
Pretty, please?

208
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,040
So we don't have the source material.

209
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,640
You've got to be suspicious of that.

210
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:10,240
On the other hand, I received an email from Chris Aleviado, Adam, I would leave a voice

211
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,640
mail, but I'm very busy.

212
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,920
Oh, excuse me, I heard you say you don't believe we landed on the moon as a heap of evidence

213
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
that we did land in the moon.

214
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,520
Apollo 11, 14, and 15 placed laser reflectors on the moon.

215
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,080
That's interesting.

216
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,520
How many moon landings did we make?

217
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,000
Did we make that many moon landings?

218
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,320
Or did they just drop laser reflectors on the moon?

219
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,920
Laser beams are routinely fired at these reflectors through telescopes at McDonald's Observatory

220
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,680
in Texas and at Grasse in Southern France.

221
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,080
Timings of these reflected beams are used to measure the Earth moon distance to an accuracy

222
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,640
of one inch to explain the existence of these reflectors.

223
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,880
The hopes advocates have no choice, but to claim they were placed on the moon by robotic

224
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
landers.

225
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,440
A huge undertaking for which there's no supporting evidence.

226
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,960
The simple answer, the Apollo astronauts, placed them there, Chris says, okay, I don't

227
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,200
know anything about these reflectors.

228
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,840
That's the first time I'm hearing from them, but if you have any information, let me know.

229
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:11,280
Call me on the voice mail numbers, plus one for New Jersey 201 65 65 657 or in London

230
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:17,160
444, plus 442 076813753.

231
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,480
Now let me bring you that thing that I fired accidentally because this is something

232
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,760
I was looking for yesterday when I was talking with Patricia about it.

233
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,920
This is pretty cool that it pertains to the Edinburgh festival and shadow falls.

234
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,200
Hi Adam, my name is Andrew Gervin.

235
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,440
Did you know the Edinburgh festival fringe or something in Edinburgh this August?

236
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
I did.

237
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,680
It's the biggest arts festival in the world, the rule verse 17,000 performers in Edinburgh

238
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
and as we speak.

239
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,680
The big booze fest.

240
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,120
I'm an Edinburgh local, but I'm also podcasting from this year's fringe.

241
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,120
The rest of Pod Show might be getting scared to it list just now at the thought of Shadow

242
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,120
Falls.

243
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,120
How do you think I felt yesterday then when I met Western Blakely who plays Breyer

244
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,760
Gent, the voice of evil?

245
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,680
We met up yesterday for a coffee and discussed the production that he's brought across

246
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,880
from Los Angeles with open fist theatre company.

247
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Of course, the conversation turned to Shadow Falls.

248
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:15,400
Shadow Falls, which is I understand it, is the first professionally produced Podcast

249
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
drama.

250
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:23,840
I am involved because the director saw me in a play at the open fist and liked my

251
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,080
voice.

252
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:31,080
That group does their radio dramas and then I came in and get to play Breyer again,

253
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,320
which is just a treat.

254
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,680
At this point, that's the only role I'm playing.

255
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,160
The voice of evil, perhaps, you have to listen to all the episodes to find out whether

256
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,560
it's really evil or not, which I don't even know that.

257
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:51,040
So what's as Western think about the medium of Podcasting itself?

258
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:58,160
It's kind of like how the internet has allowed people to create something for almost nothing

259
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,600
and put it out in the world and some of that stuff is going to bubble up because it's

260
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,680
going to be really good.

261
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,800
It was a while ago and I'm trying to think of, I think it's Francis Ford Copelo who

262
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:16,480
said, you know, the next great movie might be made by a 14-year-old girl from Ohio because

263
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:24,200
the technology is available to almost anyone and that's part of the podcasting is,

264
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:29,240
okay, I'm just going to put this out, I'm going to create something and put it out in

265
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,040
the world.

266
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,720
So it's, you know, it's a chance to do for experimentation that stuff that I like

267
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,560
about theater is the same thing that can create, be created with a podcast.

268
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,840
It's great talking to Western yesterday and there's actually the seventh interview that

269
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,440
I've done so far that I'll being hosted at podcastingnews.com, but if you want to check

270
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,400
out the rest of that 20-minute interview, as well as the six other interviews that I've

271
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,960
done so far this year, get across to whispertpromt.com, where you can also read the text

272
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,240
reviews of everything that I've been to see.

273
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,400
Thank you very much for taking the time to play this Adam.

274
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Folder.

275
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,720
I do thank you very much for putting that together.

276
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
I appreciate it.

277
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
That's really cool.

278
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Yeah, the Edinburgh Festival.

279
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
That's a big as deal.

280
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,680
And it is a huge drink festival as well.

281
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,720
So the third episode of Shadow Falls drops this Monday, Shadow Falls.podshow.com, and

282
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,120
I've already heard the third episode.

283
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,960
You are going to love it.

284
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,400
I promise you that.

285
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:30,160
Oh yeah, portions of today's daily source got brought to you by Accur, the new RDX SUV.

286
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,800
If you want to learn more about, in particular, the sound system, the sound system, which

287
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,400
is surround sound, there's a great interview with a Grammy award-winning record producer who

288
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,000
actually helped Accurate with the whole surround sound system together.

289
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,520
You can find that at Accurate.podshow.com, and yesterday also told you about the sad passing

290
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:56,720
of Sophia Ron and Marta's Little Yorky past the way way too young for Yorky, I think she

291
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,520
was maybe seven years old, and it really sucks.

292
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,200
She was sick for a couple of weeks.

293
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:09,440
And if you wouldn't mind, would you go over to Sophia.podshow.com, that's with pH, and

294
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
and leave a message there.

295
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:16,760
There's a beautiful kind of remembrance podshow plus site for Sophia, and I know that it would

296
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:24,360
certainly make everyone who was close to Sophia really happy, and I would appreciate it very much.

297
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,120
It is Friday, my friends, and when it's Friday, that means you pretty much control the

298
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,240
music on the show, and there's one person who always checks in, he is the official musicologist

299
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,240
of the Charlie, the only lawyer with a sense of humor.

300
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
You're out there.

301
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,240
I'd like to make a motion to rock this mother out.

302
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
You're out there.

303
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,240
Please don't bang that gavel.

304
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,240
You can try this cowbell out.

305
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,240
Let's all give up now.

306
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:07,240
To the hardest work in lawyer, it's Jersey, Ty, and then yeah, it's Jersey, Ty, and Bob, and yeah,

307
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
you're out there.

308
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,240
What do you say?

309
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,240
You might even win this case.

310
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,240
The Charlie's inside.

311
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,240
Yeah, yeah.

312
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,240
It was Jersey inside.

313
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,240
All of that.

314
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,240
Jersey, Ty, and Trevor, now.

315
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,240
It's Jersey, Ty.

316
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,240
Oh, yeah, you're going to try it.

317
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,240
Yo, what's up, Adam, and all the Chacha heads?

318
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,240
This is Jersey, Ty, and Adam.

319
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,240
After doing this official musicologist gig now for a couple of weeks, I finally finally

320
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,240
realized that you have some criteria that you're looking for on a Friday song.

321
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,240
Number one, it's got to have a good guitar riff.

322
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,240
Yeah.

323
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,240
Number two, it's got a rock.

324
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
Yeah.

325
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,240
And three?

326
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,240
Well, it's something you've got to play that wacky cowbell tip.

327
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Yeah.

328
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,240
The pot-safe music network, I think I found all three.

329
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,240
The band is chasing red, and the song is stroker.

330
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
Get that cowbell out.

331
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,240
Here we go.

332
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,240
And oh, by the way, Adam, scruncher.

333
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,240
Big time, scruncher.

334
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:18,240
You can't deny you saw the footage, because she had one in my face.

335
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,240
You can't deny they won't do anything.

When you took her back, that you didn't like the design

371
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:20,720

00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,840
our financial team, which is all women and all them beautiful.

379
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:46,880
And we went to this restaurant called Sketch, which is what is it on the conduit street,

380
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,880
I think.

381
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Wow.

382
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
That's a trippy ass place.

383
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,040
I tried to record some stuff to put in the next perversion for profit.

384
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,400
Hopefully it turned out because it was pretty dark, but waiting to see the bathrooms

385
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400

Oh, yes.

Come on, baby, back later on, baby.

389
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,400
Hey Adam, it's Amy Mack.

390
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Look at you.

391
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,400
You made it today three.

392
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Yeah.

393
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
I'm proud.

394
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,400
I wasn't sure you'd stick with it.

395
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Today we're going to be doing some more groundwork to go ahead and grab your

396
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,400
hands.

397
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
All right.

398
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
All right.

399
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
Got the wire.

400
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
That's it.

401
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
Yep.

402
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
You're going to get down on your hands and knees.

403
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
Hands and knees.

404
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,400
You want to make yourself a table so you want your hands aligned right under your shoulders

405
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
and your knees aligned right under your hips.

406
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Okay.

407
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
Good so far.

408
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Yeah.

409
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,400
Now you're going to extend your right arm out in front of you.

410
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,400
Right arm.

411
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
And your left leg out behind you.

412
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
I hope you can.

413
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
Yeah.

414
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,400
We should start my combat to keep you to be nowhere.

415
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
Okay.

416
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
And those back into that table position.

417
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
I'm going to table.

418
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
I'm going to table.

419
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
Ground it and you're balanced.

420
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,400
I'm a table.

421
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Now alternate.

422
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
So your left arm goes out and you're right leg.

423
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Stand it out behind you.

424
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Okay.

425
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
Good.

426
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400
That's one.

427
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Now back to the other side.

428
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
You're going to do seven more on each side.

429
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Feel free to count while I talk.

430
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,400
Or you can listen in for some helpful tips and how to get the most out of this exercise.

431
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,400
Make sure you're breathing and you're staring at the floor so your neck is neutral.

432
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,400
You want to make sure your squeeze your stomach and your butt.

433
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,400
Yeah, yeah.

434
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,400
Really control your arms and legs.

435
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
You don't want to drop them or move too quickly.

436
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
Right.

437
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
Now you should feel some your stomach, back, and butt.

438
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,400
These are your core muscles and they're incredibly important in your everyday activities.

439
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,400
The stronger they are, the less likely you are for back injury, the better your posture,

440
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
which also affects your knees and feet.

441
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,400
And of course, the hotter your butt will look.

I did a lot for me.

461
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,400
I didn't feel anything in my ass.

462
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,400

478
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,400
I have to say a little problem there with my overall condition.

479
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
Hi, Adam Kerry.

480
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,400
Here is your European Union correspondent from crazy.

481
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400

482
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,400

483
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
Comeyx trip.

484
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
Comeyx trip.

485
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Comeyx trip.

486
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Comeyx trip.

487
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400

488
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400

489
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400

490
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Comeyx trip.

491
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,400
Comeyx trip.

492
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
Comeyx trip.

493
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
Speaking of conspiracy theories,

494
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:39,400
it may be that latest action on airports in UK is an attempt by British government

495
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,400
to turn attention away from what is going on now in UK.

496
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,400
What is going on?

497
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:53,400
Well, since year 2004, when big bank, not to confuse with bank bank, European Union

498
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:59,400
announcement took place, the biggest wave of immigrants moved to UK, the biggest

499
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:06,400
in whole history of UK, officially 700,000 people from Eastern Europe just in two years,

500
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,400
but an officially, it is more than one million immigrants.

501
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,400
It is the biggest immigration wave to UK in the whole history of UK.

502
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
What is the result?

503
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Well, cancelled tax must be raised soon, and immigrants take jobs away from natives.

504
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:26,400
So, right wing tabloids are angry in UK, and next year, when Bulgaria and Romania

505
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,400
are joining the EU, the European Union administration may explode.

506
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,400
So, to turn away attention from this shit,

507
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
preferably UK government, you know what?

508
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,400
By the way, I have nothing against Shadow Falls,

509
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,400
because Mr. Niemko is a gay guy, but for fact, in the year of continuous care

510
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,400
by terrorism, why not to put you some comedy show, funny, comedy, not horror,

511
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,400
and this is just an idea, because for example, how I stand is running similar

512
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,400
audio show, but it is called Batkrek Manten.

513
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,400
Anyway, he will later, Adam, you blackberry seedling.

514
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Yo!

515
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Thanks, CSB.

516
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,400
The illustrious comic strip blogger.

517
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,400
I don't know, man, I think that's little far-fetched your theory there.

518
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Although, I have questions about this.

519
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,400
I'd like to know a little bit more about what is necessary to create an explosive device

520
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
from liquids you can smuggle onto a plane.

521
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:24,400
In fact, just before I went to bed last night, I saw that there was a report from West Virginia

522
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,400
that a woman had been apprehended there who had liquids with her,

523
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,400
two of which had tested positive for explosives.

524
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400
I'm like, what does that mean?

525
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
She's walking around with nitro.

526
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,400
I can't mess out there.

527
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,400
I'm just listening to all the wonderful profiles you guys are sending me through the voice

528
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
mail lines.

529
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,400
I'm sure that we have some chemists out there.

530
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,400
What does it actually take?

531
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,400
What do you need?

532
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,400
I think you need a combination of a couple of things.

533
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,400
That's a pretty dangerous shit, like H2SO4,

534
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,400
which you can't put into a plastic bottle as far as I know.

535
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,400
You got to mix stuff up, which could be crackling and popping.

536
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,400
I don't know, it just sounds a little far-fetched.

537
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
I'd like to know a little more details.

538
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
I don't even know who did it, man.

539
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Just give me the details of what was actually required to do this.

540
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
You know, I'm not looking for an instruction booklet.

541
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,400
I just want to know what kind of chemicals do you need?

542
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,400
How does that really work?

543
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,400
And how do you turn your iPod into a detonator device?

544
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
Let me know.

545
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,400
Oh, the Delta tones of Angie B and X.

546
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Hey Adam, I was just wondering when we musicians might look forward

547
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,400
to having our accounts rolled into the pod show plus site.

548
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,400
It'd be so cool when you're looking at my listener account

549
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,400
that you'd see my bands that are on the pod safe music network

550
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,400
as well as my podcaster on pod show would be so cool.

551
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,400
It's speaking of cool.

552
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,400
I'm totally looking forward to doing that pod show drama with you.

553
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
Yeah.

554
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
By the way, Shadow Falls is also a drama.

555
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
Come on, Mr. Blogger.

556
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,400
It's not a horror show.

557
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,400
It's a drama.

558
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,400
Angie, I think you probably got the same email

559
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,400
from Mark Yoshimoto, an MCOF that I did.

560
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,400
We have to basically explain your character

561
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,400
and your background, et cetera.

562
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,400
And so I think Mark is going to be working on that.

563
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,400
My character is pretty cool.

564
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
So that's forthcoming.

565
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Yeah, rolling that in is of course exactly what we want to do.

566
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,400
But it's not as simple as rolling it in.

567
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,400
The pod safe music network is a system all by itself.

568
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,400
It's a huge database.

569
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,400
Which already has a couple of issues of its own.

570
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,400
Mainly that there's no separate label entity.

571
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,400
So labels have actually been uploading stuff under,

572
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
putting the label under the artist.

573
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,400
Which is of course also not right.

574
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,400
We're working on it.

575
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,400
We're working on a lot of things.

576
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,400
But it's a reasonably big job, I have to say.

577
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,400
But yes, of course, we need to have that.

578
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,400
We need to have association with labels.

579
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,400
And as I think I said the other day,

580
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,400
I also like to have venues in there.

581
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,400
And a couple others you can come up with.

582
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,400
So it's working on a baby working on it.

583
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,400
Hey Adam.

584
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
This is Happy and Pearl.

585
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,400
I am the bedtime stories my kids love go for.

586
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,400
And we thought we would check out your audio comment line.

587
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Well Adam, a couple of things.

588
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,400
And we wanted us to tell you thanks for everything.

589
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,400
His downloads have been up 46% since the launch of Podger Plus.

590
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,400
So Adam, thanks for all that you do.

591
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,400
Oh yeah.

592
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
But we do have one thing we want to talk about.

593
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,400
After all, we've been through the frequently asked questions.

594
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,400
So best of Charlie, the trip to Walmart.

595
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,400
Don't you think bedtime stories might get rough.

596
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,400
They serve us and say a moment.

597
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
Hmm.

598
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
Well Adam, we got around.

599
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,400
Sometimes it gets booked and won't have to go from home.

600
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Second line.

601
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,400
Bye Adam.

602
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
Bye bye, go first.

603
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Well, I don't have one lined up.

604
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,400
You know, it's a pretty spontaneous thing.

605
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,400
If I do have to belt, I will certainly remember.

606
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,400
To promote bed time stories.

607
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,400
My kids love 46%.

608
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
That's interesting.

609
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,400
We have seen quite a network effect since we launch Podger Plus.

610
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,400
I don't know if it's 46% across the board.

611
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
But that's pretty amazing.

612
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
That is very, very cool.

613
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,400
The year up 46% just by launching Podger Plus.

614
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
I'm digging that.

615
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,400
104.

616
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
104.

617
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
104.

618
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
104.

619
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
104.

620
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
104.

621
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
104.

622
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,400
104.

623
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,400
104.

624
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
104.

625
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,400
104.

626
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
104.

627
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
104.

628
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
104.

629
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
104.

630
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
104.

631
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
104.

632
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
104.

633
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
104.

634
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,400
104.

635
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,400
104.

636
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
104.

637
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
104.

638
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
104.

639
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,400
104.

640
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,400
104.

641
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
104.

642
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
Hold it.

643
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,400
40.

644
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,400
481.

645
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
Right then.

646
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,460
I'm not going to call you a dick for putting this out.

647
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,460
I mean, it's true.

648
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:52,640
You pay more money and make sense, get better service on the plane insecurity.

649
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,480
But if I might have a little kid for a hat今回.

650
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,300
Think about this.

651
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:07,780
For a sense, the security has been beefed up since 911, and now with these new, new foil

652
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,980
the pack.

653
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:17,220
The security is stronger, the lines are longer, the lines are slower.

654
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:22,220
That means there's much more value to being able to get in the short line.

655
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:28,940
That means I'm sure some people are more inclined to buy first class tickets so they

656
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:32,220
can be in the short line, almost none of the things.

657
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:42,180
Which means in a sense, the airlines are now making money off of terrorist threats.

658
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:48,980
Now I'm not going with certain any way that any airline is beefing up the threat levels,

659
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:52,300
trying to make it seem like there should be more security just so the line gets slower

660
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,940
so people buy first class tickets.

661
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:03,420
So, something about that idea that the airlines are making money off of the threat of terrorism

662
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,820
just feel a little longer than me.

663
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:11,100
That's my 10-fuel hat moment, a helpless thing, no one scruncher.

664
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,900
Well you're a confused scruncher, because I don't believe that.

665
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:18,860
First of all airlines, making money, excuse me, airlines are most of them are a chapter

666
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,860
11.

667
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:24,180
They're not making money at all, you know, I fully expect by the end of the year the price

668
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,180
of a barrel of oil, crude oil, to go up to $100.

669
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,180
Mark my words right now.

670
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:33,380
I said it August 18th, 2006 by the end of the year, a barrel of oil will probably

671
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,180
be about $100.

672
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,300
You know, there was a huge disaster in Alaska.

673
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,300
Did you know that?

674
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:46,620
I think there's 200, 200,000 barrels a day that were coming out of Alaska.

675
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,620
Who was doing that?

676
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:53,660
Was it, ah, I can't remember which company was this only a couple, of course.

677
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:57,180
So they had to shut down because they were leaking shit into the sound again.

678
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,060
And of course, Alaska can't handle that.

679
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:05,340
If Alaska has another exon disaster, Alaska will be, you know, basically dead.

680
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,820
No, no, no, no.

681
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,660
Airlines is not a, I guess you're trying to conjure up a conspiracy theory there.

682
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:16,100
I don't believe that at all, not that airlines are trying to make more money.

683
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:22,380
And also, this is all coming from my rant about business class.

684
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:27,980
And being able to travel in shorter lines, business class is, for exactly what it sounds

685
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,460
like for business travelers.

686
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:37,940
And I remain by my stance that business travel subsidizes other classes of travel.

687
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,980
And why is it that governments around the world subsidize airlines?

688
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:46,580
And they're always trying to help to bail airlines out if it's, if they can at all,

689
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,060
it's not always possible.

690
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,340
It's because business travel is a part of the economy.

691
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:59,660
Particularly in the United States, if you, I mean, just imagine if, if, if for whatever reason

692
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,580
I couldn't travel to San Francisco, that would, that would hurt our company and therefore

693
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:08,380
hurting a minor, minor piece, but it certainly would hurt a piece of the economy.

694
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,460
So business travel is a part of the economy.

695
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:15,340
It's not a part of some kind of luxury class and some kind of class difference.

696
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,340
It's because in business, time is money.

697
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:23,140
So the less time you can spend, traveling the more time you can spend, contributing to

698
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,140
the economy.

699
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,460
That's the whole difference here.

700
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,460
Please, pair that in mind.

701
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:32,460
I have a list of states from Spanish stands and it's the English, the long time Charlie

702
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,460
Lissner.

703
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:42,500
My profile, 44, married to children, listening to PCAs and actually in the hash, just heard

704
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:49,620
you're a rampant on a 4-4-1 regarding plane business class or a class or whatever you

705
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,620
want to call it.

706
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:57,780
I had your opportunity to fly to South Africa recently with my company and I flew business

707
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:03,260
class with South African Airways, let's come over to flown business class in my life and

708
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,260
what a difference it may.

709
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,260
12 hour flight.

710
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:14,020
I work, I get some good food, I relax, I sweat and I get the ground in, take town, ready

711
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:20,940
to start working that day, like you got my gear off of the hotel and went straight to work.

712
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,940
It makes a big difference, yes, we paid the price for it, we paid the price, that's what

713
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:30,940
we want, we want great service, we want great food, we want to get the faster, we want

714
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,260
no chilling and that's it.

715
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:37,900
It's what it's all about, it's the money, I didn't pay as much as you did only pay

716
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:43,620
to in half hours of power to fly here so to save power, which is a bargain, really worth

717
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:49,380
the bargain, but yes, we pay for that and we are the people who do subsidize the economy

718
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:54,980
class, so there we go, I've got a degree with you, it is really and keep the deep purple

719
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,980
flowy.

720
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,980
Fuller?

721
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,980
Scruncher?

722
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,700
Yeah, full the scruncher, please, let me know.

723
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:06,940
Yeah, I think maybe part of the confusion is coming from actually saying that business

724
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:12,380
class subsidizes, if you say the economy class, it sounds like you're talking about a class

725
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,780
of people, but economy class of course is a class of travel.

726
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,700
Again, time is money in business and I think the only reason why I got upset about that

727
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,420
NPR report is because I'm not used to hearing that kind of noise coming out of the United

728
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:30,740
States, you know, it's clearly not about a class issue about, oh, I get, yeah, sure

729
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,940
you get better food, but it's about being able to perform better, and when you perform

730
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:40,020
better, it helps the economy, when you help the economy do, you help everybody.

731
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:46,420
Adam and David, I'm sorry, I don't just listen to DSC441 and listen to your rant about

732
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:50,660
the security line to the airports and I totally agree with you, man, I fly about a hundred

733
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:56,860
thousand domestic miles a year for work and man, I got to tell you, I pay more, I

734
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:01,700
fly more and I deserve to get that shorter line and not have to get to the airport

735
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,700
three hours early.

736
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:07,020
So anyway, I'm with you, man, and keep on rocking.

737
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,420
I'll try.

738
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,420
This is Charlie Triple IV, that's kind of a nice number.

739
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,620
Oh, we could have celebrated that one, couldn't we?

740
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,620
Now then again, maybe not.

741
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:20,740
Hey, Adam, Jack Elias, I'm a get Jack podcast.

742
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:26,660
I often invite listeners at the end of my show to email me to tell me that I suck.

743
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:33,900
Imagine my surprise listening to the Chacha this morning hearing Patricia tell you

744
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,540
that you suck.

745
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,540
That wasn't nice to her.

746
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,940
Oh, a folder, get Jack, got Podger to come.

747
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,180
Yeah, that's folder's got to stick together, dude, for sure.

748
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,620
The ad challenge is coming to a close.

749
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:52,700

One of those finalists will win the $2,000 and will actually, in essence, be hired because

752
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:07,380

753
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,380

So make sure you go and check that out.

755
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:15,140
This is the last thing I wanted to play, which came in and came in on the voicemail.

756
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:21,340
I'm not quite sure what this is and I certainly don't understand the clue or the riddle

757
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,340
yet.

758
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:26,460
Play along because someone's clearly got some kind of plan and when you Charlie listeners

Here we go.

761
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,820

762
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,820
Oh, adom.

763
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,820
Answer this.

764
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:37,340
Oh, I also forgot to mention, when women call in, it's fun to listen to.

765
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:44,340
When you play along for a cast not to miss, this is part one of a promo of nine.

766
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:51,740
Each with a little ahead and letter in line, play each one on your DSC and see if

Our goal is to entice you, adom curry, the podcast taught leaguer.

774
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:32,900
You emanate rays and disguise them as words like the god Hermes, your life is a verb.

775
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:39,300
You straddle too well to remember to yonder the Netherlands, the Gaple, San Francisco, and

776
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,860
an affluent suburb, how do you do it?

777
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:48,420
We all do ponder as you, the daily source code to live for us.

778
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:54,700
You leave us with a leafed buckling and handball a quiver, so sit back, play along, get ready

779
00:40:54,700 --> 00:41:00,540

Don't strain yourself, it's simple and not hard to do.

782
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:16,940
To become an article, not just published in print, but one spoken often, and that

783
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:22,980
out there is your first hand, now you should be hearing from me very soon with the next

784
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,980
riddle.

785
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,980
TPSN.

786
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:32,540
Okay, I'm playing along, don't disappoint me, and send me some naked pictures.

787
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,940
Would you mind?

788
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:39,940
Sorry, pilot error.

789
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:44,740
Hey Adam, it's Neil from the Podsafe Revolution podcast, your daily source code official

790
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:49,500
Podsafe Revolutionary, delivering this message on behalf of a good friend, Paul Durham

791
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,500
from Black Lab.

792
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,340
He's a bit busy these days, so he asked me to hook you up with a brand new tune, it's

793
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:58,100
called a river of joy, and it's actually not on the sea of the sun album.

794
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:02,460
It's a brand new track, it's currently featured in the trailer for the movie The Covenant,

795
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,300
it's on the iTunes Music Store, and it's soon to be on the Podsafe Music Network.

796
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,340
It's known to be different, it's a bit more techno flavored than the sea of the sun

797
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:14,100
album, but I thought it might help out those Podsho kids kick off another football

798
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,100
Friday.

799
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:21,100
It's a cheers dude, and of course you don't even have to ask, I'm with you, I'm a folder.

800
00:42:44,100 --> 00:43:14,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

801
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:44,100
yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

802
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:48,100
It's a foul, it's a foul, it's a foul

803
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:52,100
It's a foul, it's a foul

804
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:26,460
It's a foul, it's

It's a foul, it's a foul

807
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,100
It's a foul, it's a foul

It's a foul, it's a foul

810

I'm a chicken child

815
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,100
If she was a sweet place

816
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:22,100
If she could tell her

817
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:26,100
If she was a sweet place

818
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,600
I couldn't hate her

819
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,600
I couldn't hate her

820
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,600
