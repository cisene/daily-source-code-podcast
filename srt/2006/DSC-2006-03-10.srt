00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,000
very much man. I came in through promos.podshow.com. Appreciate it. Perfect.

181
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,960
That's staging for the show today. Well, for those of you who've been following

182
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,160
the court case yesterday, the judgment was handed down by the court in the Netherlands

183
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,880
by the judge. Remember, it's a professional judge system. So not a jury of peers,

184
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:56,760
but a judge who was clearly not as well informed and had not gone into depth into

185
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,960
the material as I had hoped. And we're going to talk about that today. In fact, I just

186
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,280
got off the honker with Pete up and asked him to keep the satellite window open longer

187
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,040
today. So the folks on serious satellite radio can hear this as well. On that point,

188
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,760
for the serious folks today, we have Pacific Coast Hellway, East Radio, Don, and Drew,

189
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,480
also, which at all, rather for an NCC Chapman in this four hour block of time on serious

190
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,880
stars. Okay. So if you're new to the podcast, let me just run through the issue very briefly.

191
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:34,120
I know I have to reiterate this stuff once in a while, or more than once in a while. A Dutch

192
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,720
tabloid published pictures that were taken from my flicker account licensed under the creative

193
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:46,360
Commons attribution non-commercial share like and they publish those. Clearly a violation of copyright

194
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,800
and at the same time they published information about my daughter's school and the path that she

195
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,000
takes to school and how she gets to and from school, which I felt was and my daughter as well.

196
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,040
And most parents who have emailed me agree that that is definitely endangerment of a child.

197
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,920
So here's the verdict as it came down. And I'm paraphrasing. It's available in Dutch online in

198
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:18,280
many different places. Essentially the endangerment of Christina was completely dismissed and the

199
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,240
reasoning and I'm also paraphrasing. The reasoning according to the judges, you're in the public eye,

200
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:31,560
so you can expect that. On the what I still consider and what is basically the truth,

201
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:37,160
the theft of my property, which they used for commercial purposes in their magazine,

202
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:45,000
the judge ruled us following. Don't do that anymore. And if you do, you will be

203
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:53,080
find 1,000 euros, which is about $1,200, for each time you do use copyrighted work from Mr. Curry.

204
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:00,040
So I presume that that can be used in future case law against anyone who has protected their work

205
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,760
on the internet through the creative Commons license. So while it is a win for creative Commons

206
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,440
because it did hold up in court. And of course, their argument was, well, you know, it said this picture

207
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:17,240
was public and so we were confused. The judge says, well, you know, your professional organization,

208
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:24,760
you should know better. When I find very, so obviously the endangerment of Christina is unforgivable,

209
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:35,720
I feel. And the fact that the judge did not take my work, my property into protection

210
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:45,000
for future protection, I should say, by somehow sanctioning or penalizing the publisher or the magazine,

211
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,680
I think it's a bit of a loss. Now, I wasn't looking for money. Of course, all court cases,

212
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,560
at the end of the day usually civil cases revolver on money and that's kind of how you determine

213
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,600
whether you win a law. So the fact that I got no damages can be seen as a loss.

214
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,400
Now, here's my view on this. And I obviously have quite a number of things to say.

215
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:14,680
First of all, I believe the judge did a great disservice to the court, to herself and to the country

216
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:23,400
of the Netherlands. So this starts by a contradiction. How can you say that you have no protection

217
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:29,720
over your well-being or the well-being of your family because you are famous, because you have been

218
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:37,000
featured in magazines, television and other mainstream media? But at the same time, how can you say

219
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:44,600
that that is not valuable? These magazines clearly profit from highlighting celebrities,

220
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:52,040
from showing celebrities, from taking pictures, telling stories. It really takes the court and

221
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:58,440
its opinions back to the medieval times of court gestures. You know, court gestures were funny and

222
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:05,560
great and they got all kinds of cool things from the king. But they would chop us head off if they

223
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,600
felt like it. So I feel that there is a huge contradiction in what the judge is saying.

224
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:18,600
Now, a disservice to our country comes into play. You know, I'm outside of the Netherlands a lot

225
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,640
and whether it's in even as close as the United Kingdom but certainly in the United States and most

226
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,840
other countries in the world when they talk about the Netherlands and it used to bother me because I

227
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:34,040
know that the people of the Netherlands are not like this, but you know, on an individual basis.

228
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:41,320
But collectively, they're pretty quiet and don't really stand up for a lot or for themselves

229
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:47,080
very often. They talk about it a lot privately. But the Netherlands is primarily

230
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,320
note. If you say to anyone, hey, you know, how about Holland? What do they say? Oh, that's where you

231
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,280
can, that's where drugs are legal and prostitution is legal. Yeah, yeah, that's that's great.

232
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,800
Well, now you can add disrespect for art and creativity to that mix. And I believe that

233
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:08,360
this judgment, just looking from the comments that are public on my weblog and the email that I've

234
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:14,600
received, and this is coming from all over the world, people are saying, wow, this is not really

235
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,720
good for creative comments. This is not really good for protecting our content. Whereas the courts are

236
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,720
extremely good at protecting content of mainstream media and scaring people into submission. And

237
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,080
I should clarify something. You know, these lawsuits that you hear about these huge, you know,

238
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:37,960
$150,000 lawsuits, they really ever go to trial because here's how it works. A big company,

239
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:43,800
if you take their pictures and publish them, if you breach their copyright, if you, if you download

240
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,400
an MP3 file on copy it illegally and distribute it, what that usually happens is you get a call.

241
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,960
Now, the call is not from the judge. The call is from a collection agency, which works for the

242
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,720
big mainstream media companies. And they will scare you, scare you into eventually paying a fine,

243
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:06,840
which I think people wind up usually paying between $5 and $15,000 just to get the court case off

244
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,880
their back. So it's a settlement, but they scare people into it. Now, I don't have enough money to

245
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:19,400
scare any, any large publisher or, or, or, or, or magazine into submission. So I took the

246
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,640
recourse that I had and that recourse was through the courts. And well, there you have it.

247
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:30,680
If you take all these things into effect, it's no wonder. And this is the fact that people are

248
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:36,200
emigrating, are leaving the Netherlands in the highest numbers ever. Every year, there are more people

249
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:48,120
fleeing the country because of issues like this. Now, let's talk about talk versus action.

250
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:55,960
I'm a guy that comes from a long history of doers and in my view patriots. My family has

251
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:04,120
extremely extensive history of government work, public service, work at universities, education.

252
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,840
In fact, we, we have a word for it in our family. We call it the need road syndrome,

253
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,440
which is, uh, you have to be useful. You have to do something for your country.

254
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,480
You know, my parents grew up listening to John F. Kennedy say, ask not what your country can do,

255
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,520
ask what you can do for your country. And many members of my family, even my immediate family,

256
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:32,120
have gone through great sacrifice to be a doer and not just a talker. In fact, 99% of most people

257
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:39,160
I feel are all talk and no action. I'll give you a few examples of how I like to be a doer

258
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:47,080
and like to take action and not just be all about talk. The MTV lawsuit is an interesting case

259
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,160
where a huge corporation came down on me, tried to take something from me that they had allowed

260
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,880
me to use legally and I fought them and I fought them with everything I could, which at the time

261
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:06,040
consisted a lot of media, a lot of bad press, David and Goliath tactic was about all I had. I

262
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:12,920
certainly had very limited funds compared to Viacom. It's still wound up costing me about $400,000

263
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:22,680
to combat it and we settled. Other instances of doers, of doing stuff and not just talking

264
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:31,400
in the Netherlands. And by the way, one of the reasons I'm gone is because the following things happened

265
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:40,200
for years ago. I saw this user generated content coming together. I saw it happening. I knew

266
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:47,160
that what we had was tons of audio and video recording and editing equipment all within our own grasp.

267
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,920
I knew that it was only a matter of time before the bandwidth and the infrastructure would be there

268
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,160
for us to all have. And in fact, people in the Netherlands listening will remember me,

269
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:03,000
remember that I said, someday in the not too distant future, everyone will have their own radio

270
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,280
and television station. This was actually pre, it wasn't really pre-blocking or certainly pre-blocking

271
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,480
in the Netherlands. And so of course, with that comes their own print publication. I started a company

272
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:20,360
called Jambi, an acronym for Just Anarchy Made by You, invested millions of my, literally millions

273
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:29,160
of my own money in that. And we had a client for the Veronica Broadcasting Corporation. We had a

274
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,440
three-year deal. Think about it. Think about these guys. If they had stuck with the deal,

275
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,720
they put, there was some lawyer. They made their, their chairman. And he just decided to stop paying.

276
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,760
And he said, you're what courage you got so much money. One and two pay for it.

277
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:49,640
So he broke the, broke the agreement, a three-year deal, which would have put that organization

278
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,320
at the, at a leading position in the world of user-generated content and distribution.

279
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:03,880
I feel that I really, really worked very hard. And they pulled out, and of course, when you have

280
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:10,120
30 or 40 people and you have only one real source of income for that, things fall apart.

281
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,160
And what happens is all the people who talk and don't do, jump down my shit and call me a tremendous

282
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:24,200
failure. Another thing I did, I saw after terrible, terrible fire in Volandam in the Netherlands,

283
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,520
on New Year's Eve, where scores of children died and were burned beyond recognition,

284
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,840
that because of the laws in the Netherlands, emergency services helicopters could not get to these

285
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,720
children because they were not allowed to take off at night because they had the helicopter located

286
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,120
on top of the hospital in a residential area. They're not allowed to fly after 7pm.

287
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,760
I went to the authorities and I said, you know what, I mean to this helicopter stuff,

288
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,480
I have a little helicopter company. It would be beneficial to me, but I think even more beneficial to

289
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:05,320
all security and beneficial to all people if we could have a separate helicopter in Amsterdam

290
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:12,280
that did have 24 hour a day access specifically for issues of medical emergency.

291
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,520
What would what did the talker say? The talkers jumped on me and said, you just want to get some

292
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:25,880
place for rich people taxi cabs. Something to that effect. And by the way, that heli port is there.

293
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:32,200
It cost me hundreds of thousands of euros to go through all of the red tape. It took me

294
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:39,480
almost five years, but it's there. And you should go take a look at what lands there. Very few

295
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,160
rich people actually. Mostly it's incubator flights with children who need to be rushed to the hospital.

296
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,400
There's also they do a lot for it. It's crazy. They do a lot for baby seals. And that's where

297
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,680
the helicopters are stationed. And you know, and no one has ever said, oh, that was kind of good

298
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,560
you did that. And I'm not looking for that. I don't because that's my internal satisfaction.

299
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,240
Same thing with the MTV dot com domain name lawsuit. That was precedent setting.

300
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:12,360
Anyhow, people will look back and the way the record is usually written is whoever yells the loudest

301
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:18,520
or has the biggest megaphone can determine what history is, can write history. And so I'm not

302
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:24,200
someone who stood up for his rights or for a new territory that had to be discovered within

303
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:31,640
a cyberspace. Now I became the first squatter web logging in the Netherlands. I did a lot.

304
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,560
I was one of the first webloggers. I can't say the first because I wouldn't know that for sure.

305
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:44,200
But certainly I worked very hard on building the infrastructure for web logging in the Netherlands.

306
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:53,080
If you look at web-log.nl, which is in a way kind of the blogger of Holland, the blogger.com.

307
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,280
It was just a guy who would just start it up some stuff. And I was very quick to say, hey, you know,

308
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,320
you should really do RSS feeds because that's really what makes weblogging. Yeah, click and connect.

309
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,000
And he said, well, I don't really have a money for the bandwidth for people scanning all these feeds.

310
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,280
And I said, you know what, dump them on my server. So I really help get that going.

311
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:23,480
Now, the downside of all that is with the internet, talk has become even cheaper. It's even easier

312
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,640
to just talk. It's not, you can't just sit around and hang out at the bar. You know, you can.

313
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,040
But, you know, just saying, oh, oh, we should really change something. This is no good. This is really sucks.

314
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:38,200
And on the internet, now you can actually just sit at home and do that or do it from your mobile,

315
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,520
or wherever you feel like. And just talk. You know, and talk is cheap, my friends.

316
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,840
Doing is what it's about. So let's get back to the lawsuit.

317
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:53,560
This lawsuit was for two reasons for personal reasons. And I can't help the judge's decision.

318
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:00,200
Yeah, I could go to a higher court and try and prove the judge wrong. But that is really the culture of the

319
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,680
Netherlands. The culture of the Netherlands is, and you can ask any Dutchman about this,

320
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:11,480
they compare the population to blades of grass. And they say, if you stick your head or if your

321
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:17,240
blade of grass is a little bit higher than the rest, it will get chopped off. And they say that

322
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:24,120
with such conviction like it's almost a rule. For creative commons, I went to bat this time. It's not

323
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,160
just for me. It's for creative commons. We need to know that this stuff that our stuff is going to

324
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:34,600
be protected and that there is a value on our content versus the content of the mainstream media

325
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,120
companies. The cost of this lawsuit for me, I estimate, you know, I haven't received a billion,

326
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:45,800
but probably between six and eight thousand dollars. And what this lawsuit resulted in is pretty

327
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:51,800
much a pat on the head for all creative people on the internet. They are there. Okay, we understand.

328
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,680
In fact, the judge specifically said, because the pictures were actually really cute pictures

329
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:02,120
and vacation pictures, she didn't see any harm in the publication of them. She completely missed the

330
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:10,360
whole point. So it's clear that through the mainstream system, I'll just have to call it that,

331
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:16,680
we have no real recourse. And I still believe that we have to set some precedent about the power

332
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:24,600
of we the media and the power of what we can do with these tools. It's funny, I was reading

333
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:32,200
some, actually some gossip sites yesterday who were all reporting on the lawsuit.

334
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:40,600
And one of them recounted a story. Let me see, the story is probably, it's 20 years old this story.

335
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:47,240
Even more, maybe even older. This had probably happened almost 23 years ago. It was on the radio.

336
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:56,200
At the time, there was only one popular radio station throughout all of the Netherlands.

337
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,120
Forget the pirate radio stations, which, of course, I'd done all of my doing at as well.

338
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:08,920
Trying to change the media landscape. And at that time, Patricia and I had just hooked up.

339
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,920
And she was actually living in my apartment in Amsterdam. Now, there are rules, there are paparazzi

340
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:20,120
rules in the Netherlands, not very many. But one rule is you cannot take pictures or you cannot

341
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:27,480
publish pictures that are taken through a window into someone's home because that is then you are

342
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:34,680
violating someone's privacy. Now, in this particular case, this one photographer, a paparazzi photographer,

343
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:41,240
his name is Yopfunk Tellingon, hit out in garbage cans outside of my apartment for, he says two

344
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,720
or three days. It probably was two or three, at least two, but maybe three days. And he waited

345
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:54,120
and waited and waited until Patricia was on the sidewalk and I was hanging out of the window.

346
00:24:54,120 --> 00:25:00,680
And I think I dropped the keys down to her. He got the picture. It was huge for him and published

347
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,800
widely. Now, of course, you feel, you feel shitty about that. And by the way, I have deep respect

348
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:14,040
for doers like that. I also have respect in a way for paparazzi in general who will go after

349
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,840
their target and take pictures. Now, there are limits. And I think I'm very clear about

350
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,280
following my daughter who really is outside of, you know, anything that you should be following

351
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,480
around at all. But I do have respect for someone saying, hey, I'm going to go get this picture

352
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,680
and I'm going to go travel to the United Kingdom. And I'm going to go wait until Patricia goes into

353
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,960
a parking lot and then I'm going to take a picture and I'm going to send it back and I'm going

354
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,920
to make some money off of it. Now, I mean, it's not a big social, you know, something that is

355
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:49,240
is good to society in general, but I do have to say I respect people who do something. Anyway,

356
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,160
so, of course, I had no recourse, but I figured at the time, you know what, let's have some fun

357
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:58,520
with this. Now, remember, this was the only popular radio station which had full national coverage

358
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,920
at the time. And so, I'm a radio show, which is called Curry and Fun Inkel.

359
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,400
I said, hey, you know, since I can't really do anything against this, why don't you

360
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:16,680
listeners, why don't you go down to his store? He had a photo store. And why don't you hang

361
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:22,520
outside of his house for a couple days and then take pictures? And the send-up to me and, you know,

362
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,000
the funniest picture will reward, I think, with a t-shirt or whatever. Gosh, it was amazing.

363
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,120
We got thousands and thousands of pictures and this guy was completely overrun. What he felt

364
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:39,400
for the first time is what it's like to be stalked by paparazzi. And I must say, we've actually

365
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:45,720
become quite friendly with each other throughout the years and not a meeting goes by that we don't

366
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,480
bump into each other that it doesn't say, man, you remember that? That was really funny. Boy,

367
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,320
I learned to lessen that. So, to the people of the Netherlands, and again, I have complete faith

368
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:00,440
in the people of the Netherlands in the individuals and people who are online, people who have

369
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,560
grown up with weblogs, people who are in cyberspace, who are actually overturning important

370
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:12,280
or digging up important facts and bringing them into the mainstream eye.

371
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:23,400
I've never asked for anything. Ever. And I would like to ask you to do something for me, just so

372
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:30,440
we can have some fun with this whole situation. And maybe, just maybe show the gossip magazines,

373
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:37,000
show the paparazzi's and show the court that they're sorely mistaking about the power and the

374
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,840
value and the values of what we're doing online. And I'm looking at, I'm looking at, I'm looking at

375
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:52,600
fuckpuntanelle. Webstrapeurlochpuntanelle, vidhate.com, rate to cool.com. You guys,

376
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:58,040
dipspotting.nl. Why don't we show this mark from the Linda, what it's like?

377
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:07,320
He feels that he can send people off to go stalk my daughter and follow her around and publish

378
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,520
where she goes to school and how she gets there. What if we did that to him?

379
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:19,880
Now, it's very easy. He works at an office right near the highway at Outox. He goes,

380
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,720
I don't know where he lives, but it's not so hard to follow him. It's the same thing they did with

381
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,440
my daughter, follow him home. Let's get some pictures of him and his Russian boyfriend.

382
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:35,960
Now, to make this a little more interesting, I was thinking, why don't we have a little competition?

383
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:42,360
And let's place the same value on this material that the court places on our material, which is

384
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:48,200
a thousand euros. So that would be $1,200. So we'll do a competition.

385
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:57,560
Get me pictures of this guy. The best picture, which can be judged by fun factor, by

386
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,720
by a whole bunch of different factors, but it will be judged by the number of comments

387
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:10,040
placed next to each individual picture on the weblog. We'll win $1,000 euros. From me,

388
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:15,880
I will pay it to you. I think everybody knows that I'm good for it and you can ask around,

389
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:22,920
I always pay my bills. Then we'll have a second part of the competition for people who are

390
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:28,840
doers, but maybe they don't want to get out of the house for the best photo mashup of Mark

391
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:35,720
Fondalinda, a thousand euros for that as well. And again, it'll be judged publicly the most

392
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:43,800
comments win. And that will be the best therapy for me. That's all I ask. It's real simple.

393
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,200
Let them know the pod people are here.

394
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:08,200
Sing up the fee. Be in the right to me. Everything I need. Better than the old dead frequency

395
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:17,640
from underground, hooked on the sound. Come set the fire, burn the old dial. A lot of time is now.

396
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:36,840
To the bottom, sick will call you and show you even time to take it away soon.

397
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:46,360
Can you find me for taking it over? Can you find me for taking it over?

398
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:52,360
Can you find me for taking it over?

Can you find me for taking it over?

00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,360
Can you find me for taking it over?

Can you find me for taking it over?

00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:24,440
Can you found me for taking it over?

00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,200
Can you find me for taking it over?

00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,360
Can you find me for taking it over?

408
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,600
Can you find me for taking it over?

Can you find me for taking it over?

Can you find me for taking it over?

Can you find me for taking it over?

00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,880
I knew I'd take it all out

I knew I'd take it all out

I knew I'd take it all out

427
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:29,880
I was gonna bring it with me, be with me, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

428
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:34,880
solicitor or lawyer for the daily source code said that just might not be a very good

429
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
idea.

430
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,880
Uh, thanks.

432
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
I appreciate it.

433
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,880
More history in the making today.

434
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,880
Someone is torturing Perry Dosse.

435
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:52,680
Cutting into him, piece by piece, slicing him open, spilling his blood, removing parts

436
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,680
of his body.

437
00:34:54,680 --> 00:35:01,680
A little bit at a time, who would do such a thing to poor Perry Dosse?

438
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,680
None other than Perry Dosse himself.

439
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:16,680
If he doesn't start cutting faster, he won't make it through the day.

440
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,680
Infection is the horrifying new podcast novel for me.

The daily source code has this quite a genesis to the name of the show.

459
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,680
Of course, daily source code was originally made up to appeal to the developers of

460
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,680
the podcast receivers.

461
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,680
Primarily, I think when Andrew Grummit came on the scene with his team for the lemon receiver,

462
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,680
which now, of course, is juice.

463
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,680
I thought to myself, after having gone through the pain of first learning how to code software

464
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:38,680
and then building a podcast aggregator with basically almost no content to test it against,

465
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,680
at least not regular content.

466
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,680
I thought to myself, gee, you know, what a good deal.

467
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,680
If these developers are so gung-ho, why don't I give them something to work with every single day?

468
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,680
So that was the daily part.

469
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,680
And source code, duh, that appealed, hopefully, to the developers.

470
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,680
Now, as we as podcasting grew and as many,

471
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,680
the nano came on the scene actually, I think that's what we started the nano, which is a screenless

472
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,680
not the nano.

473
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,680
I'm sorry, the iPod mini.

474
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,680
Was the mini?

475
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,680
Yeah, the mini, the one without a screen.

476
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,680
As those came on to the scene, we started tagging our podcast.

477
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,680
So I used to call it, you know, daily source code for, and I'd give the date.

478
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,680
And I didn't even start with numbers.

479
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,680
I think as I wasn't tracking the episode numbers until somewhere on 150 or whatever.

480
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,680
And that just became, you know, such a long intro.

481
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,680
And then I said, you know, why would we just call it DSC?

482
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,680
And then as I was more into flying, I started using the pilot speak and kind of as a,

483
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,680
as a goof, I said, all right, it's the Delta Sierra Charlie.

484
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
All I would car is that pulling up.

485
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,680
No, it's not for us.

486
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,680
I called the Delta Sierra Charlie.

487
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,680
And of course, people took that and started saying, on the Charlie, which is also by the way,

488
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,680
very common in aviation, where as long as you're in the right air space.

489
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,680
And you know, the tower knows who you are, you know, people will use all kinds of different

490
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,680
identifications.

491
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,680
And from the Charlie, we got to the Chuck John, to the Chuck and to the Charles,

492
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,680
and all that.

493
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:09,680
And then, of course, we found out that some people use Charlie to describe other things.

494
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,680
And this is not entirely family's safe what you're about to hear.

495
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,680
But worth listening to regardless.

496
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,680
Hi Adam, it's Charles from Petictionary,

497
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,680
but the word Charlie and penis and vagina.

498
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,680
Two tracks here.

499
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,680
I look at my enormous collection of dictionaries and I find that the word Charlie has been applied

500
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,680
to quite a few choice things over the years.

501
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,680
A style of beard, a woman's breast, the North Vietnamese, during the Vietnam War,

502
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,680
a stupid person, a white person, if you're black, cocaine, a night watchman, a fox, a backpack,

503
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,680
a coward.

504
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,680
No, where do I find it used to refer to penis?

505
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,680
Which brings me to the second track.

506
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,680
You advocate that parents should use the correct names for children's sex organs.

507
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:55,680
I couldn't agree more, but you, dear Adam, are using the wrong word when you call the gross

508
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,680
privates of a vagina.

509
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,680
It just so happens that this very morning, I began a new podcast in addition to my daily

510
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,680
one.

511
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,680
The new one is called Carnal Knowledge, and here is a sample that speaks directly to the

512
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,680
point.

513
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,680
Here I'm talking about that really successful show of the vagina monlogues.

514
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,680
The whole thing is based on the wrong word.

515
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,680
Listen to this.

516
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,680
You cannot love the vagina unless you love hair.

517
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,680
Many people do not love hair.

518
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,680
My first and only husband hated hair.

519
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,680
The thing they're talking about isn't actually the vagina.

520
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,680
The vagina is an internal part of a woman's body.

521
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:39,680
The vagina is named from an identical Latin word that the Romans used to describe the

522
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,680
scabbard they kept their knife or sword in.

523
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,680
Obviously, the vagina is named as a sheath or scabbard in relation to men's penises

524
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,680
representing the sword.

525
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,680
The vagina on a woman is not visible.

526
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,680
It doesn't have hair.

527
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,680
It's the passage between the uterus and the visible and hairy.

528
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,680
The reason the show is called the vagina monologues isn't that Eve Ensler didn't know

529
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,680
the difference.

530
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,680
It's that she was a smart marketer.

531
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,680
The correct name for the body part and question is the vulva.

532
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,680
I'm sure you knew that.

533
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:14,680
But as Dr. Harriet Learner says, most people think a vulva is a brand of Swedish car.

534
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,680
You can hear the whole thing by looking for it at podcast alley.

535
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,680
I've submitted to iTunes too, but it's not been about six hours, so it hasn't shown

536
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,680
up yet.

537
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,680
Go on podcast alley for being so fast.

538
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,680
You can search on Carl Knowledge or on Charles Hudson.

539
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,680
Thanks for listening.

540
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,680
Yo, Charles.

541
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,680
Thank you very much from predictionary.com fantastic.

542
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,680
You know, speaking of vulvos, just briefly just want to stray for a second here.

543
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,680
That new or a gummy thing that Microsoft announced yesterday.

544
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,680
I watched the whole scobal video on Channel 9.

545
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,680
That's the Microsoft developers network Channel 9, which I think is great by the way.

546
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,680
What a great way to market a product.

547
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,680
Have a scobal with this camera.

548
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,680
Go talk to the product manager.

549
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,680
Although it looks very interesting, and it seems like it might be just perfect to combine with cast blasts.

550
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,680
I'm not quite sure because I don't think it has audio in and out points.

551
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,680
It does have built in microphones and stuff like that, but I don't know if it'll take it.

552
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,680
I don't think it'll take an external sound card.

553
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,680
It'll take USB, but USB always has latency, so that kind of bites.

554
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,680
Why does that thing look like a vulvo?

555
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,680
This is the one thing that a company like Microsoft does not have in its DNA.

556
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,680
Style, style, and beauty.

557
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,680
That's what makes the iPod so cool.

558
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:33,680
The iPod now, of course, has become cool for what's on it, and not what it looks like.

559
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,680
I was like, yeah, I'll probably buy one of those if it has the right inputs, but God, it's just so ugly.

560
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,680
So non-stylish and typical, typical.

561
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,680
By the way, on the daily source code, we break for network members.

562
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,680
Steve Webb has something very important he wants to share with us.

563
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,680
Hey, out of Steve Webb here, man, $5,000 a night for a hotel room and average hotel room.

564
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,680
I tell you what, man.

565
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,680
Come to Southern California.

566
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,680
I will rent you my house for substantially less than that.

567
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:07,680
I'm in Southern California, as you know, I'm about an hour from Palm Springs.

568
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,680
I'm an hour from the beach.

569
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,680
I'm an hour from the mountains.

570
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,680
I'm about an hour from Disneyland.

571
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,680
I'm about an hour and a half from Universal Studios.

572
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,680
I've got a brand new pool of my backyard.

573
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,680
You're welcome to use, man.

574
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,680
I'm telling you, I can really cut a deal for you.

575
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,680
So think about that.

576
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,680
Number two, as far as aluminum and aluminum goes.

577
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,680
Aluminium is an element in the periodic table.

578
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,680
So if you're talking about that element,

579
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,680
Aluminium is the correct pronunciation.

580
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,680
If you're talking about the alloy that most all of us come in contact with everyday,

581
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,680
that's aluminum.

582
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,680
It's ALU-I-M-N-U-M aluminum.

583
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,680
So the Brits are right when they're referring to the Aluminium,

584
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,680
if they're talking about the element.

585
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,680
But I have to say that, you know, I've got lots of British listeners too,

586
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,680
and I don't want to offend anybody.

587
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,680
But aluminum is the correct way to talk about the alloy.

588
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,680
You know, actually, I've gotten so many feet.

589
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,680
First of all, thank you very much for the offer Steve.

590
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,680
I really appreciate it.

591
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,680
That's very kind of you.

592
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,680
But we can't even get flights to California.

593
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,680
That's how bad it is.

594
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,680
All of London is like, well, all of Britain looks like they won the lottery, man.

595
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,680
There's no more flights available even in that direction.

596
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,680
Patricia did call her record boss,

597
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,680
a villain from Cote.

598
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,680
He has hotels and golf courses in Portugal.

599
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,680
Of course, he's a mainstream record guy.

600
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,680
And used to be really active.

601
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,680
They have a long lasting love affair.

602
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,680
And he said that he would hook us up,

603
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,680
and I can definitely get to transportation down there.

604
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,680
So I do appreciate it.

605
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,680
Many, many people sent in, many, many dictionary entries,

606
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,680
and apparently aluminum or aluminium,

607
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,680
whether you're talking about the element or the alloy,

608
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,680
are both correct.

609
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,680
It's just a difference in pronunciation.

610
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,680
Let's see.

611
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,680
Next, one other thing.

612
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,680
You've often talked about how words are just words to you.

613
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,680
And for the most part, I would say that there are some words

614
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,680
that I choose not to use.

615
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,680
But when it comes to using the name Jesus Christ,

616
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,680
Adam, he means something to me.

617
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,680
That's a real person.

618
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,680
How would you like it if every time,

619
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,680
you know, I smash my thumb or something like that,

620
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,680
I go, oh, Adam Curry.

621
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,680
I mean, you didn't have anything to do with it.

622
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:23,680
And in most of the cases where you've used that name recently,

623
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,680
he didn't have anything to do with it.

624
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,680
So if you could be just a little bit more sensitive in that area,

625
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,680
I would appreciate it.

626
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,680
And I'm sure that there's lots of other listeners

627
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,680
that would appreciate it as well.

628
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,680
So just to be a little sensitive there in that area,

629
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,680
I'd appreciate it, my friend.

630
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,680
Thanks, Adam.

631
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,680
Thank you very much, Steve.

632
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,680
Well, first of all, I apologize.

633
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,680
Didn't mean to offend you.

634
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,680
And I do understand what you're saying.

635
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,680
Let me tell you where it comes from.

636
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,680
You know, having been in broadcasting and having to have lived

637
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,680
with broadcasts, rules for half of my life.

638
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,680
It's so liberating to do a podcast that, you know,

639
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,680
I kind of drop all the filters, you know, everything.

640
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,680
And that includes speech that I might not use in a public place.

641
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,680
And of course, although in smaller groups,

642
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,680
I just tend to speak the way I speak.

643
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,680
And that using Jesus Christ's name in vain,

644
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,680
I guess is the correct way to put that.

645
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,680
I can understand that's offensive to you.

646
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,680
However, Steve, I do want to say I think that that was a brilliant

647
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,680
marketing play by Jesus Christ.

648
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,680
Think about it.

649
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,680
For all these years, whenever something bad happens,

650
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,680
when you smash your thumb, people say that.

651
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,680
And of course, I didn't, you know, it was in,

652
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:45,680
I've been influenced by my parents or a television or whatever.

653
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,680
So, you know, I didn't make this up on myself.

654
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,680
This has been going on for, oh, let's say maybe 2000 or some odd years,

655
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,680
perhaps.

656
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,680
Personally, I would love it.

657
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,680
I would love it.

658
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,680
It would be fantastic.

659
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,680
People, the next time, something happens.

660
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,680
And you want to say Jesus Christ, say Adam Curry.

661
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,680
Please, I beg of you.

662
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,680
If you smash your thumb, yes, say Adam Curry.

663
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:18,680
Because it is one of the reasons I believe that his name is still out there.

664
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,680
So feel free to do that.

665
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,680
I do not mind.

666
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,680
I really don't.

667
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,680
I would see, in fact, I would, it would be, I would find it a great honor.

668
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,680
And I'm not comparing myself to anyone else.

669
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,680
I'm just saying, I would find it an honor.

670
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,680
If in 2000 years from now, when something goes incredibly wrong,

671
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,680
and they say someone smashes their thumb or bumps into something or

672
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:43,680
stubs their toe or whatever, they say, I'm Curry.

673
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,680
I hope I was successful in that programming.

674
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,680
Steve, I appreciate it.

675
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,680
Point well made.

676
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,680
Adam, this is season from Gragradio.

677
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,680
I was listening to DSC 350 today.

678
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:03,680
Okay, make that Charlie Cha Cha, Charles 350.

679
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,680
And I heard the feedback about your pronunciation of controversy.

680
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:13,680
Now, I'm just wondering if I were to move to Italy and started using, say, the term

681
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,680
Chao?

682
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,680
Would I piss off a bunch of Americans?

683
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,680
Or if I moved to Japan and started saying,

684
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:28,680
how crazy is it to think that one would not pick up some language and accents

685
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,680
from one's own environment?

686
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,680
If only because it's fun to do so, my son is a Colorado boy,

687
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,680
but it didn't take long after his move to Texas for him to be saying,

688
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,680
y'all, he's using other Texasisms.

689
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,680
So, Adam, do your thing, baby, we love it.

690
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,680
And here's a little shameless plug for Gragradio.

691
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,680
After you've finished listening to the Chuck E. Chuchu,

692
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:57,680
come on out to Gragradio.com and check out an episode of Gragradio with Doug and Susan.

693
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,680
Right on, Susan, thank you.

694
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,680
I like your voice, by the way.

695
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,680
Very husky and sexy.

696
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,680
Very, very nice.

697
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,680
Ah, Adam Curry.

698
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,680
Reminds me of Denny Crane.

699
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:17,680
Okay, let's see, we're almost at the end of today's show.

700
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,680
Um, we're going to close the set.

701
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,680
Yes, I paid up saying that we have about 30 seconds for the satellite window to close.

702
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,680
So, those of you check it out on stars and serious.

703
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,680
Hope you enjoyed today's podcast.

704
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,680
There's lots of cool stuff going on with podcast and come to podshow.com,

705
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:39,680
dailystoresco.com, to find out more, to listen to more.

706
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,680
Or just stay tuned right now for a Mark Yoshimoton M.Coff

707
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,680
and the help players coming up with Pacific Coast Hellway.

708
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,680
Um, Madge Weinstein with East Radio, Don and Drew,

709
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,680
and then Wichita Rutherford and we wanted up with CC Chap,

710
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,680
and you guys have a great weekend drive home safely,

711
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,680
and hopefully we'll meet back here on Monday.

712
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,680
So, everybody, wait goodbye to our satellite friends, bye-bye.

713
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,680
And Steve, you may want to turn the, uh, you may want to turn the sound down.

714
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,680
Hello, Adam's Curry.

715
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,680
It's Madge Weinstein of East Radio.com.

716
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,680
You're favorite lesbian on the internet.

717
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,680
I have a boner to pick with you.

718
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,680
What is all this bullshit about calling your show the Charlie?

719
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,680
That is the most annoying, heterocentric, male oriented society,

720
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,680
divergenating, well, I want to say the opposite of demasculating,

721
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,680
but you're divergenating me.

722
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,680
I think that's the word.

723
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,680
I mean, why do you have to call your show Charlie?

724
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,680
It's so stupid.

725
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,680
It's just so macho, bravado.

726
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,680
It's so soccer.

727
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,680
It's so I went to Iraq, but I didn't fight anything.

728
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,680
I just combed my hair and rode on a helicopter.

729
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,680
It's just so ridiculous.

730
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,680
Don't call it the show.

731
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,680
And besides, the Charlie, he's what they call stop for a second.

732
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:57,680
Madge, uh, I beg to differ on the Iraq thing.

733
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,680
I don't care what you say.

734
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,680
Again, I did go to Iraq.

735
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,680
I did meet with the Iraqi people.

736
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,680
I did form my own opinion, and you didn't.

737
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,680
Pain in the England.

738
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,680
So I don't know if you're making one of these drug references or what,

739
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,680
but it's got to be stopped the Charlie.

740
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,680
Why can't you call it something feminine like, um,

741
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:21,680
like the god, the Esther or the goddess or mother nature or my vagina.

742
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,680
No, you can't name it after my vagina.

743
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,680
I mean, whatever, it's bullshit.

744
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,680
Anyway, and the other thing is this,

745
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,680
it's so, your show is becoming more and more sexist.

746
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,680
This Metro sexual business.

747
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,680
What is that about?

748
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,680
And why, um, why do you have to talk about shaving for men only?

749
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,680
How come you don't talk about vaginal shaving?

750
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,680
How come you don't want to know how, what are the things I have to go through once a year

751
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,680
when I shaved my vagina to go to the Bahamas?

752
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,680
How come you don't want to know about that?

753
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,680
All you want to know is about men shaving.

754
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:53,680
You know why?

755
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,680
Cause you're a tranny fucker.

756
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,680
That's why you're a fucking tranny fucker.

757
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,680
You're a pervert, Adam's curry.

758
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,680
You're a goddamn fucking pervert.

759
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:11,680
I'm sure Patricia will appreciate that.

760
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,680
And I'm sure that she'll have plenty to say to you,

761
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,680
and by the way, why don't you come back to me

762
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,680
when you actually have grown a charlie worth mentioning?

763
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,680
Okay?

764
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,680
Oh, one other thing about,

765
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,680
remember we're still talking about doers and talkers.

766
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:33,680
A lot of banter on the boards about download with Heather and Junel,

767
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:41,680
which is a podcast underwritten and sponsored by AccuView Contact lenses.

768
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,680
It's gotten so bad now, particularly people who hang out at podcast pickle,

769
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:50,680
which I've decided I'm just not going to read any more boards,

770
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,680
podcast alley or podcast pickle.

771
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,680
And the people who are doing this, they know what I'm talking about,

772
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,680
they talk so much trash about this podcast.

773
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,680
And it's so evident that they have never even listened to it.

774
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,680
They're so lazy.

775
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:12,680
They'd rather just spew off a few lines of garbage

776
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,680
without even having listened to the show.

777
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,680
It is not scripted.

778
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,680
Yes, it's completely underwritten by AccuView.

779
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,680
There's a reason for that.

780
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:27,680
These girls, and you're so hurtful to the talent on the show.

781
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,680
They are just doing a job, right?

782
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,680
That's nothing wrong with it.

783
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:36,680
No one died and made the podcasting rules of what can't.

784
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,680
Podcasting is a technology.

785
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:43,680
It's not that there's certain rules of what you can and can't do.

786
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,680
Go listen to it for a change.

787
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,680
Listen to the show download.acuView.com.

788
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,680
It's not for 13 year old boys.

789
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,680
It's for 13 year old girls.

790
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:59,680
It's a fun show if you want to talk trash amongst girlfriends and talk about boys.

791
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,680
And yes, they talk about acuView lenses.

792
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,680
They're sponsor.

793
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,680
So stop it already.

794
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,680
Grow up, please.

795
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,680
I had a visit to Joe from the small world podcast here.

796
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,680
You know, every time you hear your listeners talk about things like DRM,

797
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:18,680
wiretapping, or companies like AOL, taxing, or emails, I get so mad.

798
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,680
I want to hurt my eye-potted someone.

799
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:24,680
Let me take a deep breath.

800
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,680
That's better.

801
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,680
Today, in the small world, I'll be talking with Mitchell Shapineck who wrote the end of the

802
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,680
blog sphere about a topic that's been discussed in the DSC.

803
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:37,680
How telecommunication companies are pushing for a legislation to create a multi-tiered

804
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,680
internet, effectively owning the web.

805
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,680
So I thought I'd turn excerpt of the interview with you.

806
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,680
My fellow Delhi source code listeners.

807
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,680
There's a very serious threat, really right now.

808
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:53,680
In fact, as I speak, and in the coming next month or two, the legislation that's being crafted

809
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,680
in the halls of Washington, D.C.

810
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:00,680
that would take the bulk of the control of the internet away from in users,

811
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:05,680
and into the hands of the major table and telecommunication companies.

812
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,680
Companies like AT&T and Verizon and Comcast and Balsal,

813
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,680
who basically want to turn the internet into their own kind of private commercial

814
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,680
feast up.

815
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,680
I think the biggest thing of what people can do is to learn about the matter and spread the

816
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,680
word.

817
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:24,680
When people know about these issues and know that people can do something about these issues,

818
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,680
it's pretty much gravy after that.

819
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,680
If you feel, as I do, that it's an issue that net neutrality and related issues

820
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:36,680
regarding the future of the internet and ultimately the future perhaps of the entirety of the

821
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,680
United States, get involved in some of the organizations that campaign for the working

822
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,680
on these efforts.

823
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,680
I'll mention freepress.net.

824
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,680
National lobbying group called Common Cause.

825
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,680
Their website is common cause.org.

826
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,680
Then more and spread the word about the issue about its importance,

827
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,680
no matter how you might feel about it.

828
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,680
If you'd like to hear the rest of the interview, you can download the show at smallworldpodcast.com.

829
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,680
Thanks Adam, and I hope the vacation works out.

830
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,680
Yeah, thank you very much, buddy.

831
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,680
The podcast Paul here in the UK sent me a Skype message this morning.

832
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,680
I replied, but I guess he was already off to work.

833
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,680
The message said, Adam, have you heard about this?

834
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:15,680
The UK government wants to all podcasters to register themselves.

835
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:21,680
They'll have to pay 100 pounds, and if they don't, and they're caught, then they will have to pay

836
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,680
1000 pound fine.

837
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,680
When does it start this registration?

838
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,680
Well, April 1st.

839
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:30,680
Yeah, Paul, I don't think you're an idiot.

840
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,680
Please don't think that I am.

841
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,680
That's clearly the lamest April Fool's joke I have ever heard of.

842
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:42,680
Just going back to, back to download with Heather and Janelle.

843
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,680
Doers and trash talkers.

844
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,680
Okay, you can sit there and talk and say it sucks,

845
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,680
and the marketing is bad, and it's a horrible idea,

846
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:56,680
or you could get up off your lazy ass, go out, and go do your own show,

847
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,680
and show how it's supposed to be done.

848
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,680
And many of you do that, and I choose not to listen,

849
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,680
because I don't think that what you're doing is cool,

850
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,680
but I don't trash you for it.

851
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,680
God, that's so stupid.

852
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:13,680
You know, here we are all infighting on these stupid message boards.

853
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,680
It's just, ah, they disgust me.

854
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,680
And I'm just tired of it.

855
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,680
I really am.

856
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:23,680
Now luckily, you'll all have something to talk about.

857
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,680
Hey, let's end the show on a high note, shall we?

858
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,680
This is a song that always gets me feeling really good and pumping for the weekend.

859
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,680
The natives of a new song.

860
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,680
And people.

861
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,680
Yeah, that's you too.

862
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,680
Out there on the pickle and on the alley.

863
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,680
We're all just people.

864
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:42,680
People are in using your hand.

865
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,680
There's music playing in your head.

866
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,680
So listen.

867
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,680
Oh, listen.

868
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,680
You're out of reward.

869
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,680
I said.

870
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,680
There's music playing in your head.

871
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,680
There's tension.

872
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,680
Oh, you got to use your tension.

873
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:00,680
You got to keep lagging about music, but

874
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,680
So listen.

875
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,680
Well listen.

876
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,680
You're out of reward, I said.

877
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,680
There's music playing in your head.

878
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,680
Now with that, we come from.

879
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,680
Is it all in the mind?

880
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,680
Is it the reasons to my whole, the act of imagination?

881
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,680
Disign, you see?

882
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:16,680
It's completely in the mind.

883
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,680
There's that soundtrack to my activities.

884
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,680
And it was in the breeze, at our first birthdays, all in knees, in now.

885
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,360
Singin' this song and you can't hope what's singin' long

886
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,160
No witchers, it's one of those demons that let you know

887
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,880
You were born, yes it's a

888
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,880
A stand-roove that's guaranteed, all you mood

889
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,240
Every school starts realising children

890
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,040
Deeply consume my people

891
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:42,640
We both are who people are in music in your head

892
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,080
They're music playin' in your head

893
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:50,320
So listen, all the less I do, I will refer to them

894
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,520
They're music playin' in your head

895
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,120
They're tension, all you can't do

896
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,120
You're the 10 times you'll keep that music

897
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,120
They gotta keep that music fit

898
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:05,160
So listen, all the less I do, I will refer to them

899
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,400
They're music playin' in your head

900
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,720
Why can't you stay, you'll find a tool

901
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,320
Then all come, go, man, add a tool

902
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,120
You've got to check the coordinates

903
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,920
I've got a lot to learn from you, got to learn from the limitations

904
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,120
And hit rid of your expectations except

905

933
01:00:41,120 --> 01:01:01,120
Oh yeah, okay, that's it. Boy, this was really cathartic. I felt really good. That's what I do it for. Just get some shit off my chest. I feel wonderful

934
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:06,120
Hey, I'm looking forward to a great weekend. I hope you have a great weekend. If you think I'm a dick, just remember

I'm only human

936
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:18,120
Adam at curie dot com daily source code dot com and if you see all kinds of weird stuff with file names and stuff like that

937
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:25,120
Obviously what we're doing right now is working on the podcast delivery network. So things might break things might fart all over the place

938
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:30,120
But that's always what the daily source code has been about it's a great testing ground. We've got some volume

939
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:37,120
So we can really see if things break apologies for that. We are working on on everything. See you on Monday everybody take care

940
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:54,120
Get this podcast and we're great ones like it on the high performance podcast delivery network from podjo and limelight networks

941
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,120
I love it
