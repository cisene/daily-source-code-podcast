1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I've got 16 pounds of porcelain toilet strap to my ass.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It was a curry cottage, your curry condo.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It was curry vinda loot.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Some way beyond scrunching or folding.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm gonna need a mop and bucket.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Why don't you listen to daily source code for eight five while I clean up this mess?

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm on screw.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's built this here at Charlie, 45.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Right, right at Murray.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The issue with the third screw will be D.S.C.485.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Like a flower waiting to bloom.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Like a light bulb in a dark room.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm here waiting for you to come home.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And turn me on.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Like a desert waiting for rain.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Like a school kid waiting for spring.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm sitting here waiting for you to come home back home.

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And me on.

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Like a flower waiting for spring.

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Since you've been gone.

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
After all you're the one that turned me on.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Now you know I can turn me back home.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And I have eyes waiting for a new tune.

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And my glass is waiting for some fresh ice here.

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm just sitting here waiting for you to come home.

26
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And turn me on.

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And I have eyes waiting for some fresh ice here.

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And I have eyes waiting for some fresh ice here.

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And I have eyes waiting for some fresh ice here.

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Now you know I can turn me back home.

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Now I have eyes waiting for a new tune.

32
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And my glass is waiting for some fresh ice here.

33
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm just sitting here waiting for you to come home.

34
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And turn me on.

35
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm just sitting here waiting for you to come home.

36
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And I have eyes waiting for some fresh ice here.

37
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And I have eyes waiting for you to come home.

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And I have eyes waiting for some fresh ice here.

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And I have eyes waiting for some fresh ice here.

40
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And I have eyes waiting for some fresh ice here.

41
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And I have eyes waiting for some fresh ice here.

42
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And I have eyes waiting for some fresh ice here.

43
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And I have eyes waiting for some fresh ice here.

44
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And I have eyes waiting for some fresh ice here.

45
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And I have eyes waiting for some fresh ice here.

46
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And I have eyes waiting for some fresh ice here.

47
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And I have eyes waiting for some fresh ice here.

48
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Perfect.

49
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Perfect for a very lazy Wednesday.

50
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Grace skies outside, heater on inside.

51
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Feeling like crap, my friends.

52
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I think the flu is still with me.

53
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I've carried it back.

54
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Maybe it's the second day of jet lag, but I just woke up.

55
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I just feel, you know what I mean?

56
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Who cares how I feel?

57
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You got your own problems, right?

58
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This is from the pod save music network.

59
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And Jersey Todd, I learned me to the fact that it was up.

60
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Of course, nothing special there.

61
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This is job as the official musicologist of the Charlie.

62
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Nina Simone, turn me on.

63
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The Tony Humphrey's vocal mix, Nina Simone, of course,

64
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
superstar in a row and right.

65
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Gosh, what is the song that's it's commercial now here in the UK?

66
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
My baby, isn't it?

67
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Nah, I'll have to look on the Napster find that for you.

68
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Hey, it's a daily source code episode number 485 coming to you from a curry cottage

69
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
in the affluent suburb of Serino as Gilford and United Kingdom huge

70
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Outage last night here at the Gilford Exchange.

71
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Of course, that always comes when I'm doing a video conference with the

72
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Office.

73
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We had a really interesting day yesterday.

74
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We had our first management off site, which means court yard

75
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Mary out down the street, but it's off site, right.

76
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And it was just amazing to see all the people who are helping us build this company.

77
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And in fact, I thought it was a pretty interesting TV show because I was literally

78
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
sitting here with my with my power book.

79
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I have to say we used I chat for the occasion much more stable than

80
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Skype video.

81
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So you know, basically use two power books and that works very, very well.

82
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Using a speaker phone for the actual voice communication just a lot

83
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
clear.

84
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And it was fun to to sit and watch everybody.

85
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And everyone, we started off by everyone telling about their background.

86
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And some of them, you know, and myself included started from you.

87
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I was born in Washington, D.C.

88
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And then what they had done and how they derived to where they were today at

89
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
the show.

90
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And it was, it was a fascinating, it was, I think that's a TV show.

91
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's a format right there.

92
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's called the, the away show.

93
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
There you go.

94
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The management away show.

95
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I would love to see senior executives of many, many companies going on the tip.

96
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Don't you have to talk about the business of the company.

97
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'd love to hear the backgrounds of the people who were involved because it really shows

98
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
the DNA of a company and helps you understand what that company is capable of because

99
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
it's that DNA that makes things happen.

100
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It was fun.

101
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That started at three in the afternoon, UK time and then around six boom.

102
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
No more internet.

103
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And it was like, you know, I could trace route into the exchange.

104
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And so I knew it wasn't a problem with the, with the line,

105
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
between the cottage and the exchange, which as you know,

106
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
is a dedicated line, took new months to get.

107
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And it didn't come back on until around 10, 15, 10, 30.

108
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And then we continued until about 115.

109
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
My time.

110
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So that's you.

111
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Maybe that is something to do with why I feel like shit possible.

112
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Here's something you won't believe.

113
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I think, why know you've heard this.

114
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You know, Jeff Smith, thegefsmith.com is the guy who's doing just tons and tons of great

115
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,000
jingles and imaging and sound stuff for, for many, many independent producers across the podcast landscape.

116
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And our buddy Slow thought it would be a nice idea to make a jingle for him.

117
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Because, you know, it's, when you're the guy that makes all the jingles,

118
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
it's nice if someone does something for you.

119
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So let's just revisit the sound of that jingle that Slow made for Jeff Smith.

120
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So I went wild about that and I love that old time, hokey, classic stuff.

121
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And I even said I said the Slow is it dude.

122
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I would love to have those girls sing.

123
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And from me turns out it's, it's all Slow.

124
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,200
That's him. I don't know how he did it. I'm sure there's some digital trickery involved and then yesterday

125
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,560
And this is this is nuts, man. This is I love this. This is this is so much what we're all about

126
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,200
Jeff Smith created. Thank you for slow. Oh, yeah

127
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,320
I like to mingle with a very best

128
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,040
Now, maybe I'm losing

129
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
I'm singing along

130
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
Thank you so much

131
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,760
I'm playing that song

132
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,400
Thank you. It's loud. Oh, making this sound

133
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,200
Thank you. It's loud. I'm singing along

134
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,000
Thank you. It's loud. It really was this

135
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,960
Thank you so

136
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,960
It's like a jingle off

137
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
It's the war of the jingle makers

138
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,200
But all in brotherly love fantastic now go make some shit for me like that got damn it. I love that

139
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,080
Again back into the fray of what's going on in Europe and we've talked about this

140
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:17,080
So I've talked about this before that the United Kingdom was planning on putting restrictions on immigrants coming into the UK from Bulgaria and Romania

141
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,000
And the reason for this is because when when the EU dropped all the borders

142
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,120
So called all the borders and really

143
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,520
Trying to make it like the United States of Europe which means you know you can move from Jersey to New York or from New York to

144
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
West Virginia

145
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,200
You can cross the borders. You can cross state lines and you can work there

146
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,200
You can immigrate into those states and the fact they call them European member states

147
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,760
There were such an influx of immigrants including myself my my dad from other European countries

148
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,960
That the UK which is an island and can only how's so many motherfuckers

149
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,400
Got a little worried. You know, they got like a million people waiting in lines and hey, we're here

150
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,680
We want permanent residency. I'm I'm number 998,274

151
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,320
And

152
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,120
Looks like they're gonna do it looks like the UK is going to put certain restrictions on

153
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,800
European

154
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:21,720
Residents who want to immigrate into the United Kingdom if they're from Romania and Bulgaria

155
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,400
Well, you know there's one guy out there who's got something to say about

156
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,480
Comic strip

157
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
Comic strip

158
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:41,000
Comic strip our resident EU correspondent come to strip blubber blubber

159
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:48,920
I was supposed to be really slick. Our resident European correspondent comics strip blogger checks in ways in on the situation

160
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,080
Wow

161
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,760
Hi Adam carry

162
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,760
It is Halloween time

163
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,560
So here's a scary story from me

164
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,520
Last week UK decided to block free movement of vampires

165
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:12,840
Who are joining European Union next year in me it means the Chancellor vanja, which is a home country of vampires

166
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,000
It's in Romania in Romania and Romania joins European Union January next year

167
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:27,000
So if you are British, I mean not you but you know, you should check your neck whether a vampire

168
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,400
beaten you out of vengeance

169
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,680
Vengeance and then data for blocking

170
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:40,760
Fimo movement of vampires within European Union anyways as far as I'm concerned. I will only welcome vampires

171
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,320
I mean people of Romania and my historic brothers from Bulgaria into European Union

172
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:55,880
I'm not scared of vampires, but you braids you should because your government not only is a puddle of Joji W

173
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,800
But your government last week just pissed off vampires

174
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,200
And what is your Halloween costume Adam carry?

175
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
What is your what are you wearing?

176
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,080
Mine is monkey as always

177
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,320
I don't participate in Halloween. I find it unhumorous

178
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,400
Our whole family doesn't find very humorous because my wife is a witch

179
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,720
You know a white one, but she's a witch so do we don't mess around with us shit, you know?

180
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,880
Yeah, there you go. So this morning I read in the newspaper that

181
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:31,240
Romania and Bulgaria are now saying well, that's good. Okay, we'll reciprocate all of your fuckers who are over here

182
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,840
We're gonna block them out and put restrictions on their freedom of movement. It's just so wonderful isn't it

183
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,600
I

184
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,120
Do understand from the UK perspective though. I really do understand

185
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:49,160
I think the the unfortunate thing here is that they're putting restrictions on certain member states and not all member states

186
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,480
I did make a mistake. I said that yesterday I said that the

187
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:05,880
That the US was not a colony of the UK well of of course it was initially but only briefly and then we kicked your sorry asses out

188
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,560
And you know what I was talking about

189
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,200
Let's see what else I've got here. Oh, that's if the different james coming in

190
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,160
Oh, Franco is that Franco?

191
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:28,840
Looks like he sent this. Yeah Franco from broadcast the tallya says Adam as of now a tallyan artist registered with the S i a e which is the

192
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:35,480
Italian version of Ascat BMI can go pod safe without worry new S i a e rules permit

193
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,520
to exclude online uses from the contract

194
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,840
That's fantastic

195
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,840
That is very very cool

196
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,320
So just like in the US even if you have

197
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,120
An agreement with Ascat or BMI

198
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:54,360
It's up to you to provide a special license which is exactly what join the pod safe music network is

199
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,760
Special license

200
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:02,120
So that other people can use it under the terms of that special license which would be the pod safe music network agreement

201
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,520
Yeah, it's great news Franco. Thank you

202
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:12,680
Jomical Auckland says dude Splendid.co.uk and I found it in Sainsbury's online store

203
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:19,320
I think the problem is I'm looking for the flavor blends. I have not seen those over here

204
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:25,960
Yes, Splendid is apparently available but I don't think they have the French vanilla the mocha and what's the other hazelnut

205
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,440
And he suggests looking at the baking aisle

206
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
brand new to

207
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,120
To the pod show network. This is cool kick kick to sneak in with that is kick to sneak is

208
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,480
Dude, he he put the high in the high fee movement

209
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,240
He's now on the on pod show plus

210
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,920
Keep the sneak dot pod show dot com. He's got a great video

211
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,360
Preview of his DVD which is coming out these guys rule the San Francisco Bay area you got to check it out

212
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,360
I'll put a link in the show notes, of course

213
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,760
Hey the new

214
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,360
MacBooks came out yesterday

215
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,600
Aren't you sick of it now don't you see how I'm so happy I didn't buy

216
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:14,600
You know the first MacBook first of all. I of course would have been one of the apparently 10% of people who have this random

217
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,240
You know shutdown syndrome

218
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,520
Overheating frying your nuts crap not working stuff blowing up

219
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:29,880
All the hardware issues that the and this is why I why change to windows not because of I love OS X

220
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,120
I love OS 10. I love the Mac interface. I love the way it displays

221
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:41,560
I really love everything about it, but the hardware is just freaking me out and then this is what the third generation out of the MacBooks you know

222
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:48,440
There's no upgrade paths. You said to keep buying a new one and you and you get so frustrated because the one that you just bought sucks

223
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,440
So bad that fucking breaks all the time

224
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,360
Remember that that sound problem that's stuttering sound that really that's really what got it all going for me

225
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,880
So anyway, I'm thinking maybe you know if Apple would would just

226
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,360
Release one and say hey, this is it, you know, this is the state of the art and

227
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:13,240
And it's out there for half a year and it actually works and you know, and I'd love to know if there's another faster one coming out

228
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,600
I mean you don't you can't release three a year it makes me feel like a dick

229
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:24,600
Do one a year I'll upgrade once a year if the shit works and don't do this interim new product releases it makes me so mad

230
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,120
Like I should have known like I wasn't in on the in the it would the in crowd

231
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,960
Let's see oh

232
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,960
Remember Giselle who called in from I think it was San Diego

233
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:48,200
And she really got me going by saying that we had a connection and she really love hearing me in our ear

234
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And

235
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It was a very

236
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,600
sexually oriented message that she sent me I've got my doubts now about this

237
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,920
I think I'm being set up listen to Giselle who checks in again with us. Hi Adam. It's Giselle

238
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,640
So I was out of town until yesterday

239
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:15,560
But this morning I'm out jogging out by Pacific Beach listening to my iPod and Friday's DSC comes on and I got so excited by the sound of your voice

240
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:23,160
But it literally made my knees weak and then I heard you play my message and here I was jogging down by the ocean

241
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:31,880
Yeah, so far so good, right, but it's it starts. I don't know you tell me, but well, I'll I'll I'll ask you the question after you've heard her whole

242
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,120
Her whole voice message freaking out

243
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:39,320
And I wanted to grab strangers off the street and jam my earbuds into their ears so they could hear it

244
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,680
And then you started talking about touching yourself

245
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,440
And I literally got so worked up that I couldn't even think straight

246
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,120
I started thinking about you touching yourself and then started thinking about you touching me

247
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,560
I'm thinking about it right now and

248
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:04,920
I went into a Starbucks right off mission boulevard and I went into the bathroom and I re-round the show and got myself off

249
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,680
Spray there in the bathroom

250
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,560
Biting my lips a whole time for that nobody would hear me

251
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,120
Yes, I'm a freak, but I'm starting the things that I really want you badly

252
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,080
And yes, I would absolutely do a three-way with you in Patricia any time

253
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,240
Maybe I'd even let the two of you time me up and do stuff to me

254
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,120
Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself

255
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,440
I gotta go, but when I get home, I'm gonna get into a nice hot bath

256
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,600
Listen to your show from today. I can't wait for a little bit

257
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,400
Catch your later sexy

258
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,280
Now listen to that last bit. Okay. That sounded like she was reading from a script. Listen any time

259
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,440
Maybe I'd even let the two of you time me up and do stuff to me

260
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,720
But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Get this. I got to go. But when I get home

261
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,800
I'm getting in a nice hot bath. I don't know show from today. I can't wait for a little date

262
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
See now I'm a little disappointed. You're sexy

263
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,560
Catch your later baby. I don't know now. I'm a little disappointed now because I think someone's having a run at me

264
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
This doesn't sound real anymore

265
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Still kind of turns me on though

266
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,880
I'm a fucking freak

267
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:23,880
Greetings Adam and all daily source code listeners. This is bicycle mark citizen reporter of the

268
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,920
Internets

269
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:32,280
That's right. I'm one of the many reporters that look at the world around us that report on issues in ways that the

270
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:37,480
mainstream simply won't using the wonderful technology of podcasting and video blogging

271
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,040
I just wanted to put a call out there for all citizen journalists if you're doing a program

272
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,520
I'm interested in hearing about it and if you're interested in citizen journalism then perhaps

273
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:53,000
Come over to my work at bicyclemark dot org that's bicyclemark with a k dot org

274
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,560
This week I'm doing a special tribute to Paul Wellstone remembering the man

275
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:04,360
What made him special and how much the world needs him nowadays and what would he say if he saw what was going on now

276
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:11,480
For the more I'm doing a series on global mayors mayors who are out of the ordinary for their profile or for their

277
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,160
Policies or making big change in their cities in ways that the national government never could

278
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:24,120
So for all the citizen reporters and the people concerned about the world around them hope to hear from you Adam take care

279
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,760
and I use a bidet

280
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,560
Just a bidet

281
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,560
Just a bidet man, just a bidet

282
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,280
bicyclemark citizen journalists no less and not a big fan of that

283
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,440
Of calling someone a citizen journalist or a group of people a citizen journalist

284
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,600
I think it's I think it's a waste it's a waste of

285
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,040
Great resources the bicycle mark has a fantastic audience

286
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,960
As does here's one for a Richard blue sting another person who I think would call himself a citizen journalist not coincidentally

287
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,320
They're also good friends

288
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,320
Richard blue sting who is currently

289
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,480
Apparently temporarily sitting in from edge wine steen on yeast radio

290
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:15,000
Is going to release an interview actually I call it a conversation because I already heard it a conversation with Cindy she had

291
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,560
Of course the mother who lost her her son in Iraq and that stage of protest against that again

292
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,480
The war and against the administration specifically against the George Bush

293
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:35,320
And it was a it was a fun conversation to listen to I think he's going to release it on the next Monday on the 30th of October

294
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:42,120
I wouldn't go as far as to call it an interview because it was just like you know Richard and Cindy talking and

295
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,320
You know there was no controversial questions. He was just kind of pulling stuff out of her

296
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,320
It was nice to listen to because

297
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,200
It was the first time that I've actually heard Cindy she and talk

298
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,760
You know as herself in a relaxed atmosphere, you know, just a good conversation and so that was interesting

299
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,240
And I'm not going to comment on it until you've had the opportunity to listen to it as well

300
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,680
I'm also not sure if Richard's going to edit it or

301
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,080
Plenty pieces out. I don't think he will

302
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:16,200
So I'll I'll I'll I'll hold back on on that conversation but the whole idea of citizen journalism

303
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,920
You know, it's like we're we're educating an entire

304
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,560
Generation of people who know how to sound off, you know sound off

305
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,240
Be media talk like media and I'm not talking about like traditional media, but you know

306
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,280
Just exposing it's all about the exposure it's all about the communication of the issues

307
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,640
But they're very few people who are using all this technology and

308
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,160
These these vast audiences that we have and these social media networks that we're creating

309
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,040
To actually go and do something, you know, I would much rather see someone say

310
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,720
Hey, I'm running for office and I'm going to

311
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:02,840
My platform that I'll use will be the new media platform because let's be honest if you want to be president

312
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,440
I guarantee you even I can become president if you give me $500 million

313
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,040
Because I'll take that $500 million. It actually costs about

314
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,640
300 million in the last election. So that's why I'm going to give me a little little margin there

315
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:22,360
I can be $500 to advertise because that's how we choose presidents. It's how we choose this so powder that we buy in the supermarket

316
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,360
It's how we choose which gas to buy it's

317
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,240
It's how we choose what other crap to watch

318
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:34,440
It's how we choose presidents marketing works television advertising works. I personally believe that

319
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:40,760
Independent independently produced media and the way we're distributing it is much much larger

320
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,880
much more engaging and I'd love to see

321
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,640
Was Barack Obama interesting guy. You know, I saw him for about an hour and a half on Larry King

322
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,760
And I think he's got the charisma. That's really what we need. We want an actor in the White House, you know

323
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:02,040
Someone who has is reasonable and can act that that's what we as Americans wanted the world wants that really you want a strong

324
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,680
Dedicated leader. It's all that that's what a lot of leadership is about is how you position yourself and and how you lead by

325
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,640
Example and he'll make mistakes if if he ever gets in the office everyone will fuck up

326
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,280
But that's okay, you know, just say yeah, I fucked up

327
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,320
That's the easiest way to deal with it and we're going to do better next time

328
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,720
But why isn't he

329
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,760
You know using this new platform is because he knows that he's not ready his organization is not ready

330
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,080
It's just going to be a traditional campaign. I have to say on all this. I'm really with Dave Winner on

331
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:36,120
How we should be using this. I'm just not interested in people exposing how horrible government is and

332
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:44,200
The atrocities of everything in the world and how unsafe it is. I want people to go do something and here's something that I've always held to

333
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,000
A country gets the government that she deserves

334
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:55,640
Really does what we have now in in the White House is what the United States deserves it really is in the UK

335
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,800
You've got Tony Blair you don't like it you deserve him

336
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:05,000
You know, you everyone has the individual power to go and change that. I'm personally not all that unhappy

337
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,120
And the main reason is because I know that it's only going to be two more years, you know

338
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,440
And then there will have to be a change one way the other that's going to be a different president. That's for sure

339
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,840
I would actually call to arms and go to arms if there was

340
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,600
If somehow and I've I have heard this pop up before that all you

341
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,240
Bush administration's gonna try and prolong the the term limits

342
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,640
I tell that's gonna happen, but yeah, I'd actually grab a gun if that happened

343
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,720
But if you want to change the world if you're so unhappy then you know jump on the platform

344
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,800
Use this stuff and run for office run against whoever's running

345
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:49,160
That's that's how you do it that is the only way we're we're teaching people we're teaching our kids

346
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:54,360
How to communicate about how unhappy they are. I think we're kind of forgetting to teach some how to run

347
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,840
For something how to run and compete and debate

348
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,160
At any rate it's going to get a lot better

349
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,640
Mainstream media at least that is because it is finally dying out the final

350
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,040
Signal is here my friends. What is that final signal you ask well

351
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,160
I've said before that when any industry is about is just about on its last legs

352
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,720
There's a technical term for what happens. It's called consolidation and

353
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,640
Essentially all the small companies roll up into one big one

354
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,880
You see this with oil

355
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,120
You see this with the the record business

356
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:36,680
Only a few huge companies at this point conglomerates made up of many many many smaller companies

357
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:43,000
And then there's only one step after that and that is what's happening to clear channel communications clear channel

358
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,400
Of course owns 1200 radio stations owns many outdoor venues

359
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,000
Really owns a large chunk of the US media landscape

360
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:58,520
They are now in talks with KKR. That's right the famous guys if you're read the book or seen the HPO movie

361
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,120
Barbarians at the gate about

362
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
RJR Reynolds in the bisco

363
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,400
Then you know that these guys are in they'll take

364
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,880
The company private which means they're going to buy the company from the shareholders

365
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:17,960
So we'll no longer be publicly listed and then they're going to split the fucker up thousands of people will lose their jobs

366
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:23,640
They're going to split these divisions sell them off to individuals or individual

367
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,120
Other companies who feel that they have a need for a piece here a piece there and

368
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,320
This is it they're going to destroy it. They're going to break it all down. They're doing it for themselves

369
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,320
They make huge amounts of money

370
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:41,080
On the on this type of process particularly the people who are running the company make huge amounts of money

371
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,880
And of course with the loss of all of these jobs people getting nervous

372
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,200
They start looking for jobs elsewhere and I think they're going to find that there are many alternatives

373
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,840
I would welcome many radio professionals to join the pod show network

374
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:01,240
You know we pay for for people who want to work no problem come on over sending email happy to have you

375
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:09,240
So it's just another you know a little little little mark on the wall there as we see mainstream media

376
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:14,760
Crumbling before our very eyes again the question is what are we going to do with it when we have all that power?

377
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:21,240
All right, so I'm in mistaken Michigan right now. I'm a skig in Michigan isn't exactly a great town

378
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,200
Quite frankly it's a shithole. I can't fucking stand it

379
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,360
I mean there's nothing to do here. There's nothing but bowling and drinking and drinking and bowling

380
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:34,360
And I don't drink anymore because I'm an ex-alkaholic and I'm not going to go bowling without drinking because it's bowling without drink

381
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,360
Just fucking stupid

382
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:42,440
All right, so I'm walking home and I'm trying to cross a street. It's a one way four-lane highway

383
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,160
It's really not that busy. You know what I'm saying

384
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,000
If it had maybe like five cars on it, I'd be impressed

385
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:56,040
So I look I see the cars are stopped at a light down the street and across in a little street. No big deal, right?

386
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,280
Well, I'll behold them on the other side of the street and a cop flashes me over

387
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,960
You know you really shouldn't cross in the middle of the street kid

388
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:10,120
Hey, I'm from New York City. I got the street court crossing think hovered

389
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,760
Well, it's really not safe to cross in the middle of the street. You should use the crosswalks

390
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,560
Listen, I'm from New York buddy. I've crossed eight lanes of rush hour traffic

391
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,640
I've had yellow cabs almost hit me because they're too anxious to get a jump on a green light

392
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:30,840
I've had more on jump red lights while I'm in the middle of the street and I've weaved in and out of midtown rush hour traffic to get to work on time

393
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,240
I know how to cross streets buddy

394
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:42,280
They smile that me gave me a $75 ticket for disturbing the peace and then told me have a nice day

395
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,080
Now that's fucked up

396
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,040
Oh, and Adam your New York phrase it a week. Yeah, watch it more on I'm walking here

397
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,840
Watchin more on I'm podcasting here. Thanks buddy

398
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,480
Uh

399
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,160
See two things I had written down. Oh, yeah a lot of people sending me this email about jet blue

400
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,040
Experimenting on it and in fact the email is actually coming in experimenting on passengers

401
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:11,720
Well, they weren't experimenting on passengers apparently jet blue tried out an experiment and we're monitoring

402
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,960
Their air crew to see if there was any decrease in performance

403
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:22,760
Flying 10 hours instead of the current maximum, which I have not been able to confirm that that's the maximum

404
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,560
But the current maximum apparently of eight hours of flying

405
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,720
And so of course people are outraged that this was being tested well passengers were in the plane

406
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,560
I don't think I have enough information to comment on it right now because it's just a lot of he shed

407
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:43,000
He said she said here say there, you know a low level FAA official granted the the test

408
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,440
They had the third pilots in the cockpit and you all this stuff

409
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,440
And of course there's lots of agendas in here

410
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,240
Primarily the pilot's union

411
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,080
Who may not want to have

412
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:01,560
Their pilots flying longer this you know be very careful with spouting off about this one thing

413
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:07,400
I'm pretty sure of you were in no danger if you're on jet blue and I'd get on any jet blue flight at any point

414
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:14,360
Because I just don't believe that you know, I just can't believe all this noise you know I saw this with the cori-lightle

415
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:23,160
Reporting how completely incorrect it was so I'm just not gonna jump on board here and say

416
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:27,720
Yeah, yeah, jet blue did a bad thing. I'll keep my eye on it, but it's just oh

417
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:34,840
We're so quick to judge hey one cool piece of software I wanted to tell you about this TV unit works. Have you heard of this yet?

418
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:40,360
It says some I think these guys are in somewhere in in Asia East Asia

419
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:46,920
Maybe it's China. No, not China. I can't remember who it was well all of course I'll put a link up TV unit works

420
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,600
And this application which as far as I can tell is windows only

421
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:57,080
You started up and it's it's appear to appear streaming video application and

422
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,800
Essentially you can watch American television

423
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,240
It's very cool because it's got ABC and BC CBS it's got ESPN it's got comedy central

424
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,240
It's got a whole bunch of basic you know channels basic television channels

425
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,000
Unfortunately most of them are the San Francisco feeds so

426
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,800
Really with the eight-hour time difference it makes no sense for me to try and watch anything in prime time

427
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,680
But just the whole idea that I can flip it on here and I'm seeing a San Francisco signal literally

428
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,560
I'm seeing the San Francisco local affiliate of each of these stations

429
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,160
It's fantastic. I'm sure there's a huge lawsuit waiting to happen here

430
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,440
although I don't know if I were ABC and BC or CBS I'd be fucking delighted

431
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,400
You know you're you're it's not like the commercials aren't being aired with it the commercials are being aired with it

432
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,680
It's free extra distribution you're marketing to me and I'm loving it

433
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:49,880
Something you may want to try out though because it's cool and and they will also let you broadcast using their infrastructure as well so

434
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,720
Keep a close eye on that

435
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:58,360
Lakuna coil that's the last song I'm gonna play for you today. I didn't even know this but

436
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,320
Lakuna coil who has appeared on cover rolling stone magazine and

437
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:09,320
Let me just see if I can find I'm in the pod save music network right now. Let me just click through here

438
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,840
Here we go look on a coil. Let me see what the bio says

439
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,720
Look on a coil exhibits a miraculous eloquence in their collusion of melody and metal

440
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:27,480
They also maturely exhibit and chanting Gothic overtones and point melancholy to build their ethereal ethereal ethereal

441
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,480
ethereal musical landscape. Oh, I really butcher that

442
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:37,000
So this track has been released before the official album

443
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:44,440
Fucking A you better believe it because they've seen the light this is Lakuna coil

444
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,040
And closer

445
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,040
It's actually called the radio edit go figure

446
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:11,280
What it comes are

447
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,360
Yeah

448
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Falling in the far, then something real

449
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Tell we're in the city, the streets, but I'll go to

450
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Won't you get close, I'm in to you

451
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
No, no, I'll do it so then

452
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
There is just nothing to get changed

453
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
So I'll face you, you last rich, you scorn

454
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
No, we need to get lost

455
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I'll get far, far, far, far

456
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Which is to find a son ofków, you scream

457
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
T Sound on my flame

458
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,400

Let alone in the redgads

461
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Let's stop

Break it to the dry

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Let alone

464
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Shake your brush

465

Blow it down

466
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And then the flames

467
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,720
