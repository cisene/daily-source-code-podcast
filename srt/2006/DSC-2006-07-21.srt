I like to think I'm flying into this show.

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,480
I'm just kidding.

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,480
I'm crazy.

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,480
One hit.

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,480
We got it.

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,480
I got it.

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,480
We have clearance plans.

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,480
Roger Roger.

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,480
What's our vector, Victor?

16
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,480
How are you?

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,480
Very cool.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,480
Missing clearance over.

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,480
Over.

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,480
Roger.

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,480
Gotta sew.

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,480
But you may do.

23
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,480
That's what it's all about.

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,480
Gotta sew.

25
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,480
And that you may do.

26
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,480
Love you.

27
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,480
What's all about?

28
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,480
I'm not sure.

29
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,480
I'm a surfman.

30
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,480
I'm a hero.

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,480
Think I'm wild.

32
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,480
No, we got a soul.

33
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,480
I'm a human.

34
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,480
That's what keep it kind of.

35
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,480
Gotta sew.

36
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
I'm a human.

37
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,480
Way out of your mind.

38
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,480
We have no limit.

39
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,480
Watch the other side.

40
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,480
I'm a muster.

41
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,480
Gotta go to the station.

42
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,480
But to me, it's real.

43
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,480
What's not right now.

44
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,480
We keep it kind of kind of.

45
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
I know what we got.

46
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,480
It's a soul.

47
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
I'm a human.

48
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
I'm a human.

49
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
I keep it kind of.

50
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
Gotta sew.

51
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
But to me, it's true.

52
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,480
But to me, it's true.

53
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,480
But to me, it's true.

54
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,480
But to me, it's true.

55
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,480
But to me, it's true.

56
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
But to me, it's true.

57
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,480
But to me, it's true.

58
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
But to me, it's true.

59
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,480
But to me, it's true.

60
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,480
But to me, it's true.

61
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,480
But to me, it's true.

62
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,480
But to me, it's true.

63
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,480
But to me, it's true.

64
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,480
But to me, it's true.

65
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,480
But to me, it's true.

66
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,480
But to me, it's true.

67
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,480
But to me, it's true.

68
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,480
But to me, it's true.

69
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:29,480
But to me, it's true.

70
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,480
But to me, it's true.

71
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
But to me, it's true.

72
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
But to me, it's true.

73
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,480
But to me, it's true.

74
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
But to me, it's true, but to me, it's true.

75
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,480
But to me, it's true.

76
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
But to me, it's true.

77
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,980
But to me, it's true.

78
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,980
Boring each other.

79
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,980
I like the way, it's true.

80
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,980
Welcome to the Curry condo.

81
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,980
It's a daily source code coming to you from Northern California, another beautiful day.

82
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,980
With some tunes to kick it off from Jersey.

83
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,980
It's rocked down baby with a soul connection.

84
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,980
Sounds like it could have been from Athens, Georgia.

85
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,980
Don't you think? A little bit of BJT2's vibe in there.

86
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,980
Wow, not much to report about yesterday, I'm afraid.

87
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,980
I don't really remember much of yesterday.

88
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,980
I was so completely wrecked and tired from, you know,

89
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,980
the jets at life of flying and drinking.

90
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,980
Oh man, I was destroyed.

91
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,980
Still got a lot of stuff done though.

92
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,980
Actually had a pretty good crap, crap mixer.

93
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,980
Had a pretty good chat with the folks from Barefoot radio,

94
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,980
which I think airs, that air, I don't know when it goes on.

95
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,980
They do stuff live and then they also do stuff as a pre-recorded podcast.

96
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,980
Check them out at BarefootRadio.com.

97
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,980
So it is bright and early Friday morning.

98
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,980
I'm so looking forward to the weekend.

99
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,980
I cannot wait to get more than five hours of sleep.

100
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,980
That would be really, really nice.

101
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,980
It's so early every day when that alarm clock goes off.

102
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,980
Man, ready to kick it for you.

103
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,980
It's Friday.

104
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,980
We got the party going on.

105
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,980
We got, um, how many?

106
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,980
I got like four or five different songs.

107
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,980
So let's move right on through in a couple of pieces of feedback.

108
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,980
Some of which are more entertaining than others as usual.

109
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,980
Hey Adam, this is Travis Goss, the host of the unradio show.

110
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,980
And I was thinking about your podcast earlier today.

111
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,980
And what I thought about was episode number 398.

112
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,980
There's released on June 2nd.

113
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,980
And that was the episode where Bare Lady Patricia was your guest.

114
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,980
And three quarters away through the episode.

115
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,980
You played a song of hers called Daddy.

116
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,980
And I did not know until that time that she was a singer.

117
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,980
She used to record songs back in the 60s and 70s and 80s.

118
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,980
Possibly in the 90s.

119
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,980
I am not.

120
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,980
Maybe possibly in the 50s.

121
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,980
Oh, I'm so sad Patricia's not here to hear this.

122
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,980
She always says, I know it gives a shit about what I was doing.

123
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,980
And then one can't say about it.

124
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,980
Oh man, I hope she's listening to this at home.

125
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,980
Idiot, this is where you fill in the gap for me.

126
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:52,980
So basically, I'm a guy who listens to hard rock and metal and also anything that's gothic.

127
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,980
But when I heard her sing that song, my foot was tapping.

128
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,980
I was like, wow, that is so fucking cool.

129
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,980
I'd say, man, you wrote yourself good one because I give anything as whole world

130
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,980
to have a girl like Patricia 5.

131
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:13,980
So anyways, what I'm asking is, are there any albums of hers that you could recommend?

132
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,980
I'm pretty sure that most of them are out of print.

133
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,980
But that's what internet is for.

134
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,980
Finding all this stuff.

135
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:27,980
I'm more than willing to go on eBay or go to any online record shops and try to find her albums.

136
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,980
Okay, well what you need to do is go to redbullet.nl.

137
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,980
That's the record company.

138
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,980
Either that or EMI.

139
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:40,980
You got to go to the Dutch EMI website or she's had like three or four different record companies.

140
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,980
And I think we've discussed before we don't have her back catalog.

141
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,980
We really don't.

142
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,980
It's just, it's just, there's so much of it.

143
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,980
Just, you know, you leave it in this house and you give it to that person.

144
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,980
You forget about it.

145
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,980
And yeah, you can have this CD.

146
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:58,980
And before you know what, you have no CDs, no records, no pictures, no videos, no not just memories.

147
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,980
So what would you recommend for me?

148
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,980
And also, a couple more things I like to mention.

149
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,980
Just listen to Shadow Falls.

150
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,980
Genius.

151
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,980
Mark.

152
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,980
Dude, you created one of the coolest podcasts ever.

153
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:22,980
It's like a throwback to all days when we had radio as a means of entertainment before there is television.

154
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,980
Of course, as well, well, well, well.

155
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,980
The, when radio was, was like fun to listen to.

156
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,980
Yeah, back in the day, when radio was entertainment.

157
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,980
Yeah, I got to tell you, man.

158
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,980
We had so much fun putting this project together.

159
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:40,980
It's been many months in the making, but it was, it was cool to, you know, work on the story.

160
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,980
And Mark has such a great team.

161
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,980
I mean, we don't really, maybe the office in Los Angeles is a piece of shit, shack and Venice Beach.

162
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,980
I don't know.

163
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,980
I don't even know what kind of, we say studio.

164
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,980
I have a feeling.

165
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,980
I've got like a microphone and a Mac and Pro tools or something.

166
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,980
But the group of people that that we were able to work with on Shadow Falls is just phenomenal.

167
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,980
These are really good actors.

168
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,980
These are people who are working actors who just saw the fun of this.

169
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,980
And, you know, and of course, they, they got paid.

170
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,980
And they enjoyed it.

171
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,980
They really had a good time.

172
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,980
It was really creative.

173
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,980
You know, and Mark has all kinds of stuff that we got to get to.

174
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,980
These are like, we have clips from table readings.

175
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,980
We turned on some recording while there was writing going on.

176
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,980
I mean, it really, truly, it is the audio version of a spelling entertainment.

177
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,980
It's my time.

178
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:36,980
But it was so cool that with podcasting, you sort of reinvent this whole thing with old-time radio.

179
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,980
But it came out with something brand new and fresh.

180
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,980
And as genius, I, I am an instant fan of Shadow Falls.

181
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,980
I am so looking forward to the next episode great stuff.

182
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,980
And finally, one more thing.

183
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,980
I know you retired the subject.

184
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,980
I'm a folder.

185
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:57,980
It's a lot more sanitary than being a scruncher in my humble opinion.

186
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:03,980
So anyways, Adam, I thought I'd go ahead and ask you questions and pass along some good comments.

187
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,980
Talk to you later.

188
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,980
John Radio Show.pot show now.

189
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,980
There it is.

190
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,980
Okay.

191
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,980
All right, man.

192
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,980
Thank you very much.

193
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,980
Enjoy the pod show plus.

194
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,980
So I don't know.

195
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,980
When is the next episode of Shadow Falls coming out?

196
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,980
Is it, uh, do we do it on Monday?

197
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,980
I'll have to ask Mark.

198
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,980
But, uh, yeah, Kudos for sure.

199
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,980
I mean, Mark is going to take all the credit for this.

200
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,980
And that's okay.

201
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,980
We know who really did all the work.

202
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,980
Don't we, Mark?

203
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,980
You're honored.

204
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:32,980
I'd like to make a motion to rock this mother out.

205
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,980
You're honored.

206
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,980
Please don't bang that gavel.

207
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,980
You can try this cowbell out.

208
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,980
Let's all kiss a night.

209
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,980
To the hardest work.

210
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,980
And long hair.

211
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,980
He's jersey tied.

212
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,980
Hey!

213
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,980
Talk to me.

214
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,980
Let's go to hell.

215
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,980
So you talking to me?

216
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,980
Well, I'm the only one here.

217
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,980
Well, well, well, what's up, Adam?

218
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,980
I'm curious.

219
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,980
Jersey Todd.

220
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,980
And I could not have possibly heard this on yesterday's shot shot.

221
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,980
It's going to be the thank God.

222
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,980
It's Friday edition of the Charlie when we're Northern California.

223
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,980
We got a rocket out.

224
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,980
So send it into me.

225
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,980
And that's yes.

226
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,980
I'm looking at you, Jersey Todd.

227
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,980
The official music colleges of the Charlie.

228
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,980
Get it in early.

229
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,980
Get it in as soon as you can.

230
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,980
Are you looking at me?

231
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,980
You know, you and me, Adam.

232
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,980
We're, we're Jersey guys.

233
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,980
And you know, here in Jersey.

234
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,980
That's considered calling a guy out.

235
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,980
Whoa, whoa, whoa, pot father.

236
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,980
You call me out.

237
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,980
Get out of here.

238
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,980
Forget about it.

239
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,980
You want a Friday song.

240
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,980
You got a Friday song.

241
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,980
Okay.

242
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,980
Fine.

243
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,980
It's summer time.

244
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,980
And you need to go down the shore.

245
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,980
You need to hear one of the most unique voices on the podcast.

246
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,980
Music network.

247
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,980
And that voice is Jendello.

248
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,980
So of the band allowed.

249
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,980
You want passion.

250
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,980
You want rock.

251
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,980
You want to get things going.

252
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,980
Well, then you've got to get a loud.

253
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,980
Hey, got nothing but love for you, baby.

254
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,980
Have a great weekend.

255
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,980
I was born on the beaches.

256
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,980
I am long and to be free.

257
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,980
I have lived.

258
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,980
But the stations will be crossed.

259
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,980
The hands over me.

260
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,980
I will die.

261
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,980
And I must be the only case in a zero.

262
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,980
My belief on our actions.

263
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,980
Ain't no conflict in this world.

264
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:19,980
You are the world of Washington.

265
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:26,980
You are the world of Washington.

266
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,980
You are the world of Washington.

267
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,980

You are the world of Washington.

276
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,980
You are the world of Washington.

277
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,980
You are the world of Washington.

278
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:22,980
You are the world of Washington.

279
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,980
You are the world of Washington.

280
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,980
You are the world of Washington.

281
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,980
You are the world of Washington.

282
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,980
You are the world of Washington.

283
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,980
You are the world of Washington.

284
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,980
You are the world of Washington.

285

You are the world of Washington.

286
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,980
You are the world of Washington.

287
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,980
You are the world of Washington.

288
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,980

You are the world of Washington.

308
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:31,960
Now we fall on the beach

309
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,960
Oh, yeah, time is up to here

310
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:41,960
Oh, yeah, time is up to here

311
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,960
Oh, yeah, time is up to here

312
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,960
Oh, yeah, time is up to here

313
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,960
Oh, yeah, time is up to here

314
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,960
Thank you, Jersey Todd, the official musicologist of the Charlie

315
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
You did me just as once again my brother

316
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,960
Aloud and beaches from the Podsafe Music Network

317
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,960
Jiminyd on a Friday, yeah, that sounds good

318
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,960
Ah, he's been looking forward to Friday night

319
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,960
You know the Friday night in San Francisco

320
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
where I come home after working

321
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:21,160
home after work and just collapse and forget to eat and do you have the ability from the weekend

322
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,360
cast really, really loving the new Pod Show stuff. I think it's great. There's one question

323
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,160
are we ever going to merge the Pod State Music Network and the Pod Show stuff so you can have

324
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,600
one login where you can, an option where you can merge your accounts and playlists so that

325
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,360
you're able to put things up on the, on the Pod State Music Network and also on the, on the

326
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,760
Pod Show account. Just wondering if that's ever going to be a possibility if that's ever,

327
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,280
if that's even brought up. So thanks, love and the show keep it up. Yeah, baby. Absolutely. Yeah,

328
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:57,080
yesterday, emo boy Mark showed from Pod Show HQ showed me what it's going to look like because

329
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,600
yeah, of course we're going to merge that. It makes that doesn't make a lot of sense where you

330
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,200
have one account that also works in the Pod State Music Network and it's also where you

331
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,320
where your songs are that you've purchased absolutely and also the purchasing still has to be

332
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,720
turned on for everybody. So there's, you know, there's a lot of stuff going on. Absolutely.

333
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:21,560
And it looks really phenomenal. Just look at Pod Show Plus. Look at my page on Pod Show Plus,

334
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,960
look at anybody's page and then imagine what we could do adding music to that and integrating

335
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:32,280
the Pod cast and integrating listeners. It's yes. So the answer, of course, is yes. Absolutely.

336
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,120
And all the songs that you hear today on the Charlie, can of course be found on the Pod State

337
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,840
Music Network links to those in the show notes. Hey, Adam, it's Bruce Murray from the Zedcast and,

338
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:49,080
you know, folder, scruncher, roller, muncher. I mean, it doesn't much matter to me, okay? What you do

339
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,960
in the privacy of your own WC is between you and your maker. I mean, people who listen to the

340
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,200
Zedcast know, I don't ran very much. You know, I'm trying to keep it light, but there is just

341
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:05,400
something that burns my butt if you'll excuse the pun. And that is after the aforementioned fold or

342
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:12,440
scrunch, people who do not replace the roll. Okay? This is just human kindness. I mean,

343
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,920
sometimes you're in a hurry. You can run in, close the door. Aw, sweet relief. And then you turn to

344
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:25,240
the roll and there's nothing there. The person before you has used every last square and left you

345
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,280
the empty roll. And then you're hobbling around the bathroom with your pants around your ankles.

346
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,320
It's not a pretty sight. Okay? So, and it does not like it takes that long. Here, here I'll show you.

347
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,040
Okay, I'm here in Pacho Headquarters and somebody has left an empty roll in the stall.

348
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:47,000
And if Chris Rockwell came in right now, he would be mighty upset. Anyway, I'll show you how quick

349
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
this is. Start the timer. Okay? Doesn't gauge? Toss the old core. Hey, three points. Reinsert.

350
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,160
New roll and engage. Oh, yes. What's that? Four, four and a half seconds? I mean, I know

351
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,440
everybody's in a hurry, but come on, people. Before you race, please replace.

352
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,240
For the record, I fold Anne scrunch. That's why I guess that pretty much makes me a funger.

353
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:15,160
Anyway, Adam, you can check out the Z-cast at Pacho Plus and I was going to do the little

354
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,800
lighter click thing at the end here, but I'm pretty sure it'll be a little unsafe to have an open

355
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:26,760
flame in here right now. Exactly. Oh, wait. All right, man. Thank you very much, Bruce.

356
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,800
Really appreciate it. By the way, the lady Patricia is often known to leave the core exposed.

357
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,000
More about that when I get back to the hospital.

358
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,480
It's cold, he didn't fall out. Boy meets girl Jimmy, he world was slapping pills to les all out.

359
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,920
Not once, not twice, he was thraced out to lady. Back in all brand new, but I had to.

360
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,920
Bounce over to the Uncle Service Insta. Click up his pills that take care of my nervousness in.

361
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:23,720
On the way, I saw planes and was stuck up with stars. She played games, but she took them too far.

362
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,120
At the driving, watching soft morning, you can tell by the trail of the tent that there was

363
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:33,320
something in the popcorn. Popped in my cab, destination, mid-town. Just a kid up with some kids and

364
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:39,240
like to get down. I made my rounds and that was that. In between the frowns, the scraps, and hard

365
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:45,240
intact, and I remember. I seen a ass early November, on the Thursday, taking back Sunday for a brief

366
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,920
fun. She shot a wig like no hard feel is that she jell it to Brazil, and the pills had me spun.

367
00:17:50,920 --> 00:18:20,280
How many different band names did you hear in that track?

368
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:26,920
Music network. It is taxi driver brought you by Jim class heroes on the daily source code for Friday.

369
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,720
If you're listening to this in Australia, how's your Saturday doing? Hello Adam. This is Ron with

370
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:38,360
zip 71101 podcast here in Louisiana. You mentioned it was hot there in England, 91 degrees.

371
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,360
Well, it's 106 here in the shade in Louisiana. Man, August has not even come and it is already getting hot.

372
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,560
Well, we've just learned to live with it. So I guess that's what you'll have to do as well.

373
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,440
Hey, I heard you play sunny combs in the kitty cat rodeo. What was that Friday?

374
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:03,720
And I just happened to have a new interview. My latest episode with sunny combs, and then you can find that

375
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:11,720
at zip.podshow.com. Just click under my shows and I'll take you right to it. Love and pod show.

376
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:18,440
And it's not a lady Patricia. We said hello from Louisiana. Hi, Adam. This is Whitney Hoffman from

377
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:25,640
the L.D. podcast. Listening to the Charlie as I was tooling around in the car today. I saw it

378
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:33,880
of how neat it was when we were in England. I'm the virgin trains run by Richard Branson. They

379
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:40,440
had channels like radio channels that they have on airplanes where you can plug in your headphones

380
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:46,120
and listen to all the different music that was kind of pre-selected. And I was wondering,

381
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:54,840
have pod show looked into doing channels for airlines and trains and things like that?

382
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:01,000
Just like the channel exists on serious satellite radio, it would be great if there were podcasts

383
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,240
and pod safe music available when you're taking a trip somewhere on a long distance,

384
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,560
you know, and get some more exposure that way to people who might not otherwise actually listen

385
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:18,200
to pod cast. Just a thought, something you might be interested in. Thank you for everything. I love

386
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:24,200
pod show plus and love the Charlie. Thanks so much. Bye-bye. Yeah, thank you. Good question, actually.

387
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,320
You're from time to time that does pop up and there'll be, once in a while, there's a company

388
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:35,160
that does something for airlines and then there is like a brief conversation. But

389
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:41,400
in general, first of all, that business is very stable. People who do that stuff for

390
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,440
in flight entertainment, those companies, they know their clients and they know how to handle

391
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,280
their clients and they know what to do. So it would have to go through one of those companies and

392
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,880
there's all kinds of stuff going on there that I just don't think we can break into. But really,

393
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:02,760
it is kind of a dying breed. Sure, I know that there are people who absolutely still listen to

394
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,960
the inflight entertainment, but really with MP3 players. I think that that is pretty short lived.

395
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,240
And maybe we'll see a lot of that capacity that's in those inflight entertainment systems

396
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,560
being swapped out for something else, a little more useful. Like, well, broadband connectivity.

397
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,200
Yeah, I know. I know that airlines are now saying they don't even want to do it because it's

398
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,160
too expensive and the customers don't use it. But believe me, within the next five years,

399
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,920
we'll be connected everywhere and you'll be able to just turn on whatever box that is you

400
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,360
have in your hand and you'll be able to get stuff that doesn't even live on the box.

401
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,400
It'll just come in streaming and it's very clear that's going to happen. Maybe 10 years, who cares?

402
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,720
But yeah, it would be nice. Certainly on the Virgin Trains, that would be cool.

403
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,880
So if anyone's listening and you're curious about how we could hook up, give me a call at the

404
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,880
Charlie. Hi, Adam. This is the French lady.

405
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:00,200
Ah, it's going to be not dead yet, the life I call you to give you some feedback.

406
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:07,880
No, I'm not dead, and I'm still podcasting. You can check us at the 2021.com.

407
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:15,880
It's my little website. And I'm kind of a secret agent, no, and still busy with a lot of this one

408
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:23,720
and I'm building a theater, explain them that theater in Las Vegas, that's why I

409
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:31,400
I didn't call the time to see this is what sucks so bad. You heard the quality of that call was bad,

410
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,840
right? And then it cuts out. It was really a shame because he went on for like a whole

411
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,800
other minute, the French lady bastard. Finally checking in, it's just the quality of the call

412
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,960
was so crappy and you couldn't really even follow the conversation. But what he did do is he did send

413
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,480
me a song that he thought would be perfect for playing on the Friday. Chacha, so I want to roll

414
00:22:49,480 --> 00:23:02,200
that one out for you. Jazz breakfast on the Charlie. Feel that. Make your feet want to move.

415
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:15,480
So I want to say music makes me groove. Gekko 3.

416
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,680
Yo, we're coming back late from the show. There's only one place to go because it's open till three

417
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,160
in the end or entry fee. We're just in the queue and it's high time for me to wear

418
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:34,600
but hold them back up and to let the moves come out nice and clear. Seven ovals. He been drank it all night long.

419
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,480
But bother read is not the favorite place to go with night. You know we told the many times

420
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,880
that we just don't like the light. The sabers ain't facts, but a maiden meets with a wattage yet.

421
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,520
It's open and free and represent the fucking cottage. Spirits are high, what a bunch.

422
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,440
From all the cool, the moment we take out already we could do. Without the movement of the

423
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,600
getting and going around the shift, yeah man, that ain't no uma bad yet could it get eight points

424
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:02,280
to step on do. You want to do, you wanna do, you wanna do, you wanna do, you wanna do, you wanna do,

425
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:10,200
you wanna do a jazz breakfast. It's the question not everybody who laughs. From do, you wanna do,

426
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,360
do, you wanna do, you wanna do, you wanna do, you wanna do, you wanna do, you wanna dudo, you want to do it,

427
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:22,800
It's gone 2202, it's so beneath to make a move

428
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,240
I've the neck and back the OJ, well through sticks

429
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,840
It's in the foam, smooth, try it out

430
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,800
It's a lot of pausing for the body in the afternoon

431
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,400
Now we're singing our hangover tune

432
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,640
We're almost been standing in the shower for an hour

433
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,360
Fuck him, we're making our way

434
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,160
To the city, can't think we got a table at the back

435
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,520
So we don't take no flag

436
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,920
When we try and play pool and end up looking like so cool

437
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,920
Slow the true hiccup and rest of the crew

438
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,600
That's the smooth, smooth, smooth, smooth tip

439
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,800
And we're falling too

440
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,040
We got the love of me, shoot mama, don't be wild

441
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,240
I'm the late everybody

442
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,840
I know the table you say yeah

443
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,840
When we say here you want to do

444
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,040
Do you want to do? Do you want to do?

445
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,080
Do you want to do?

446
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,280
The jazz breakfast

447
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,800
I'm a hip-hop to wait just

448
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,080
I do you want to do? Do you want to do?

449
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,080
Do you want to do? Do you want to do?

450
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,120
Do you want to do?

451
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,400
The jazz breakfast

452
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,480
Lips the king, once she knocked off paper

453
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,760
And yeah, could I get tea for three or five more for coffee

454
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,160
The girls are still the side, so we start here with me

455
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,680
Now I know it's not an event

456
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,040
Because you can't miss the slack

457
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,560
Because we all want chicken burgers

458
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,840
I'll be nursing jack

459
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,280
I'll be nursing jack

460
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,640
I'll be nursing jack

461
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,000
I'll be nursing jack

462
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,280
I'll be nursing jack

463
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,640
I'll be nursing jack

464
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,160
I'll be nursing jack

465
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,680
Shit, I need some pickle chili

466
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,280
I'm a Monterey snack

467
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,520
Lips the side, you got the arby breakfast

468
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,800
No shit, hold the funk, I said

469
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,480
It's your little beans, I think they've touched you

470
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,760
They got it, love is hungry

471
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,200
But what, fuck's he's making?

472
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,800
He wants the arby breakfast

473
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,400
Vegetarian, we have a bacon

474
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
The spirits in the beef are all fun

475
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,320
But I mean they never get the order right

476
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,760
No shit, wait so patiently

477
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,000
Now we can't see the table for the lady's time

478
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
They made the fun, we know where we'll return

479
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,680
Because the mousse is going to make us

480
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,840
Do you want to do? Do you want to do?

481
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,840
Do you want to do? Do you want to do?

482
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,880
Do you want to do? Do you want to do?

483
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,840
The jazz breakfast

484
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,880
Do you want to square?

485
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,160
Yes

486
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,920
Do you want to do? Do you want to do?

487
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,880
Do you want to do?

488
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,160
Do you want to do?

489
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,920
Do you want to do? Do you want to do?

490
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,040
In jazz breakfast

491
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,920
Guys, guys, can we get some more jazz

492
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,280
without?

493
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,920
Thank you, this is plenty

494
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,680
Do you want to do? Do you want to do?

495
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,160
Do you want to do?

496
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,400
do you want to do? Do you want to do?

497
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Do you want to do a jazz breakfast?

498
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,160
Uh, uh, do you want to do?

499
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,840
Do you want a dude, do you want a dude

500
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,740
Do you want a dude, do you want a do

501
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,000
A Jack Sommerckfriend, who steaks down the photosket with the check?

502
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,600
Yeah

503
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,400
You know we'll remember all this cool music coming from us from the pod save music network

504
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,000
Ah... Friday Show as always compiled by listeners of Charlie

505
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,100
Thank you so much laxi french bastards

506
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,240
Next time dude, don't pick up the phone

507
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,560
If you're gonna really run on with something cool like that

508
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,580
Send me a video comment

509
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:09,580
Which you can still do, of course, adamaccurry.com, DailySourceCode.com as where you can find this show.

510
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:16,580
You can play it right there, you can get the show so you can always be alerted when there's something new there.

511
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:22,580
Yes, we even have old-fashioned XML links, so you can copy and paste it into the favorite pod catcher of your choice.

512
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:27,580
The following is a paid political announcement from the Troy Needs and iPod Foundation.

513
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:33,580
Always true, there are a podcaster and an iPod.

514
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:38,580
Master Yoda, is adamcurry the pod father?

515
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,580
Told you today, how?

516
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:46,580
For Trinit, pod show plus, go there you will.

517
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:50,580
iPods run heavily in pod casting.

518
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,580
Adam has one.

519
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,580
Alan has one.

520
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:59,580
I don't have one.

521
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:04,580
You must bring balance to the pod cast.

522
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:10,580
For once you start down the pod casting journey, forever with the dominate sure does.

523
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,580
I won't fill you master.

524
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,580
I'm not afraid.

525
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:26,580
You can help bring balance to the pod us here.

526
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:32,580
This is www.troyneeds and iPod.com today.

527
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,580
I shouldn't say it.

528
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:41,580
I played that because Troy has a domain name, Troy Needs and iPod.com.

529
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,580
This thing is now escalating.

530
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:49,580
It's his other guy who has a domain name, which is I need to add more than Troy.com.

531
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,580
I was thinking, what a perfect opportunity to go to godaddy.com.

532
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,580
And register, screw those guys.

533
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,580
I should have the iPod.com.

534
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,580
In fact, here's a new contest for you.

535
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:08,580
The most original domain name registered through GoDaddy, which will be judged by me,

536
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,580
and by me only, of course.

537
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,580
We'll receive an actual iPod.

538
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,580
It only costs $6.95 to enter the contest.

539
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,580
Go to godaddy.com.

540
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:21,580
Choose that Waktas domain name that pertains to the Troy Needs and iPod.com contest.

541
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,580
Use code DS3, DSC3.

542
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,580
Upon checkout, you get the domain name for a whole year for $6.95.

543
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,580
Think about the entertainment value.

544
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,580
And, of course, a chance that an actual video, it's not just an iPod.

545
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,580
I just heard from the judges, it's a video iPod.

546
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:44,580
I don't want to be infinity cause it goes to midnight.

547
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:49,580
I don't want to be in Berlin green because it's plastered all the time.

548
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,580
I don't want to be in line with my cause.

549
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,580
There's nothing there to do.

550
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:00,580
I just want to spend some time with you.

551
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,580
I don't want to be in sincey cause.

552
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,580
It smells like burnt tires.

553
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,580
I don't want to be in Cleveland cause.

554
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,580
The vehicle catch on fire.

555
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,580
I don't want to be in date.

556
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,580
Not without a 22.

557
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:24,580
I just want to spend some time with you.

558
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:30,580
Will it solve them hard to find the reason?

559
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:35,580
To stay in this and carry in place.

560
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:46,580
But it's hard to find the reason to be.

561
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:51,580
I don't want to be in New York cause it's buried under the slime.

562
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:56,580
I don't want to be in Portland where it's raining all the time.

563
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:02,580
I don't want to be in San Francisco in the early morning too.

564
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:08,580
I just want to spend some time with you.

565
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,580
I don't want to be in London cause.

566
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,580
The skies are always grey.

567
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:18,580
I don't want to be in Paris because I don't powerly know from saying,

568
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:23,580
I don't want to be in China with a horrifying flu.

569
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:28,580
I just want to spend some time with you.

570
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,580
Oh!

571
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:37,580
It's a reason that morning in Vancouver.

572
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:42,580
The highest folks are scaring the church.

573
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:48,580
We watch that church from Earth's sludge.

574
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:53,580
I guess this place could be a horse.

575
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:58,580
They say the grass is always greener.

576
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:03,580
On the other side of the car in life.

577
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,580
But I just stay.

578
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,580
The grass is pretty anyway.

579
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,580
Because I just want to spend some time with you.

580
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,580
I don't spend some time with you.

581
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,580
Josh Woodward won then up the Charlie for his Friday.

582
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,580
Thank God it's Friday.

583
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,580
I'm ready for the weekend.

584
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,580
Thank you again for everybody who sent in songs.

585
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,580
I think it's titled Innership.

586
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,580
Because that's what shows up in the ID3 tags.

587
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,580
Although on the Podsate Music Network, if you follow the link, you'll see that it's listed

588
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,580
as in Teria.

589
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,580
I don't think that's right.

590
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:39,580
And I sure hope it's Innership because that's the stuff that keeps helicopter pilots alive.

591
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:43,580
Alright everybody, next week's going to be a really big week.

592
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:49,580
We'll be rolling out campaigns, features, new episodes of amazing new podcasts.

593
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,580
So including I would hope a brand new shadow falls, bone design the way.

594
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,580
And I'll be here in Northern California to take you through it a haul.

595
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,580
Hey, take it easy this weekend.

596
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,580
What are you going to do?

597
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,580
Do it safely.

598
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,580
And I'll see you on Monday.

599
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,580
Boy, I'm slow.

600
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,580
Another Pod Show podcast.

601
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,580
Stick it in your ear.

602
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:20,580
Get this podcast and more great ones like it.

603
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:25,580
On the high performance Podcast, a delivery network from Podshow and line-white networks.

604
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,580
I love it.
