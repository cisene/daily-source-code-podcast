No, no, no.

10 hundred radio stations used to be.

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,200
Yeah, they used to say they were at the top near private stable.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,520
But they really weren't.

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,260
we're in Jersey in Chicago. Then we got C. Clifton. Yeah, so we got to Nellon's

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,360

Jersey jam cast. We get Jersey tide. There's that, let's show it that no

20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,800

Renee, Martinez shot, I can name a mall. Yeah, macatak. Yeah, the same for 64.

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,560
I was $16 million worth of airplane scrapped to my ass. Then the next

25
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,400
generation radio content in my ears. I like to think I'm flying to the

26
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:52,100
damaged church. I'm just hitting this male Kori.

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,160
This what you take.

28
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,000
I know that I stopped and began again

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,840
There's a big sand in the middle and with the fresh season

30
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,400
With the land of M&M

31
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,840
Such a beauty, lost in the melody

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,720
Like a fairy dying, back from the solid dream

33
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,360
This mystery of a body

34
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,960
Stops the body, should be fell in the air

35
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,280
It's kinda hot on me, cool with the water

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,200
What the matter, many of you love

37
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,600
If you can imagine how I wanna get you

38
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,360
Love in the bottle, maybe I should be shown

39
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,360
Love in the bottle, maybe I should be shown

40
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,600
Girl, you will miss me

42
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,400
When you're booking down sick, like crazy

43
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,040
And I try, but my knees get lazy

44
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,040
When you're bringing around somebody said, man, said, man

45
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,760
Everybody's just standing back cause

46
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,480
There's a thing up the night when I'm in the front of us

47
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,640
Can't battle in a team or something

48
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,000
Because you got to learn that, I'll make you want to battle in this

49
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,560
When you're recording, mama, there's many of you

50
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,240
Love, if you can imagine how I wanna get you

51
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,200
Love in the bottle, maybe I should be shown

52
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Love in the bottle, maybe I should be shown

53
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,400
Love in the bottle, maybe I should be shown

54
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,280
Love in the bottle, maybe I should be shown

55
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,440
In the bottle, maybe I should be sure

56
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,560
Love in the bottle, maybe I should be sure

57
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,200
You could, what if you can, same sex

58
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,080
Maybe it doesn't look modern

59
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,080
I know I just couldn't get it, so I didn't have to stay

60
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,580
I got it, so you can go go

61
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,580
Wanna talk about me, so sit down, you and me, yeah

62
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:05,080
Getting silly and just to kill an end

63
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,080
I know what I've been beginning again

64
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,080
There's a big sand in the middle and the branches

65
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,080
With the land I came in there, I'm such a rude and lost in the melody

66
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,080
I can't forget you back from the thought of you

67
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,080
Just a mystery of a body

68
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,080
Just a body should be a felonist

69
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
I got it, so you can go go go

70
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,080
Wanna what you're like, I got it, so you can go

71
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,080
Wanna see what I've been trying to show me

72
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,080
I'm in my heart, so you can go

73
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,080
Wanna what you're like, I got it, so you can go

74
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,080
Wanna what you're like, I got it, so you can go

75
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,080
This is kinda how I'll make you walk with them

76
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,480
With the motto, with the man, I'm a mini-eat

77
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,480
The music, I'm out of sitin, I'm rapin' your love

78
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,580
To be held by all, if it is to put your love in the car

79
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,280
Really explore the studio space with the cowbell

80
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,580
Everybody how you're doing is the daily source code

81
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,980
Coming to you from the affluent suburb of Surrey

82
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,480
known as Gilford in the United Kingdom

83
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,080
Once any other gardener's just left you guys missed it

84
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,680
Got a bit of a late start today

85
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Christina announced last night she was not feeling well

86
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,880
So we decided to keep her home from school today

87
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,880
Which of course when you know, 16 is like, like we have any say over it

88
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,180
It's clear when you're the 16 year old doesn't want to go

89
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,080
She really doesn't want to go and she does like schools actually

90
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,880
So we got a little bit of a sleep in today until I was like quarter to nine

91
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,080
That's a big deal in the cottage

92
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,880
So of course, I'm running around behind myself already so much to do

93
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,480
I had some tapings, I was taping this morning in my bathroom

94
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,080
But of course, that is the true luxury of podcasting and independent production

95
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,080
Alright, thanks for all the opening show opens

96
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,880
For four, six, four today, 464 episodes and counting

97
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,080
Daddy cast the Jersey clan and of course comic strip blogger

98
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,880
He left an interesting comment yesterday in the show notes over a daily source code dot com

99
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,880
Let me let me read this for you

100
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,880
You didn't play intro four six three for me probably too scared you were you chicken. I well no problem

101
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,880
I've just sent you intro four six four actually comics are blogger

102
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,680
I just completely spaced on and I'm sorry. I wish I could do it over again

103
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,400
But you know, send whatever you want. I love playing openings and then he goes on to say regarding getting an

104
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,280
EEA visa for the UK as you know now the Christine and I are officially on on mom's co-tails

105
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,760
We're allowed to stay in the UK. He says maybe you could for once say in public. Thank you

106
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,600
You're well, let me do it. Let me let me say it once in public here

107
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,680
We go. I have to say this so yes, be commands it and I will read verbatim

108
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,280
Thank you European Union for freedom of movement so that I can't live in UK

109
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,720
Thank you

110
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,640
Yes, thank you European Union. That is kind of cool the way that works. I totally agree

111
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,360
Yesterday had a couple of German listeners check in and he's guys had a very serious question

112
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,200
Now, you know, I'm not a beer drinker. I definitely get my kicks from the sticks

113
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,520
But they wanted to know where the best placement is in a refrigerator for a beer for keeping it

114
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:38,400
For keeping it cold and drinkable and well, I knew this would happen all you have to do is throw it out on the Charlie once and the comments keep rolling in

115
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:46,760
Daniel from a stoic growth was done on Ontario here. I was listening to DSC463 and was rather concerned when I heard the comments from the two German listeners

116
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,300
Being a German expert myself. I referred to my handbook the

117
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,760
Deutsche Spundelskop Public Handbook called for Russia or poor

118
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:04,000
Guide to German living when you're not there anymore and it's beer handling section. It does refer to the correct temperature at which to

119
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:11,320
As a sort of store and drink beer and it has really nothing to do with the whether the fridge is colder or not

120
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,360
It where in the fridge is colder or not. It is more so concerned with the quality of the taste of the beer

121
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,520
That sort of mitigates the the bitter after taste

122
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:29,480
So the beer is to be refreshing but not freezing as otherwise. There is no taste all right and done on your reason that you would really

123
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,440
Sort of want to freeze it at the point of incomprehension is that

124
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:39,720
Is is because while the beer is too cheap the trick is to spend a little bit more money and get something that isn't as horrific

125
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:47,800
The handbook list is a good start any kind of beer that that is advertised on television and if you dispose of that you're sort of on your way

126
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,880
So I just thought I had no clue you could talk about beer like that

127
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,000
Just sort of mentioned that and then I'm sort of prepared to revoke the citizen service over that so

128
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,680
What the file note scruncher. Oh post-cript

129
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,960
Remember in school when they they tell you that that that the human brain is is based on is

130
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,360
Has the sort of wrinkles in it and that this provides additional surface area for where you blend just a flow

131
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,440
So to put yeah, I think I missed that particular class to be quite honest. I don't really remember

132
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,040
I've seen a brain it does look wrinkled the ability for all of the neurons and such the function and

133
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:34,440
Then if it were to suddenly you know smooth out then then you really wouldn't be able to so sort of support the kind of activity that

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That the brain does

135
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,120
So and I'm thinking that this sort of applies in a similar respect to two to those scrunching folding business

136
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,280
I mean with your folding you sort of wrap it around a couple of times and you don't really get you sort of have a

137
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:51,160
Fixed surface area, but scrunching on the other hand and this is a sort of the magic science it work

138
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,440
I think

139
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,000
So to permits additional service area for the paper in which to sort of dispose of the adverse material that what otherwise

140
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,440
Well create a sort of a squishiness that that's

141
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,240
Don't even like so

142
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,400
That's sort of my pseudo scientific analysis. I thought you might enjoy that take care

143
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,880
Dude, of course. I completely

144
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,840
Appreciate you taking the time to send in a comment, but two things one

145
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
What the hell did you just say?

146
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,200
Two

147
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,640
Decaf sent say oh my friend. It definitely exists. Oh no

148
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,240
Just when you thought you were safe

149
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,880
It wings on by a

150
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,880
Can't do for you

151
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:58,920
Sneak it in under that satellite window before closes PW Fenton host of digital flotsom and producer of the pod show on serious

152
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,920
Hey Adam speed up

153
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,200
On Tuesday you played a comment by a Brit named Charles

154
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,840
He is now my new best friend because he absolutely loved the only thing I've ever done

155
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,120
That people almost universally complained about

156
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Two people thought it was funny

157
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,000
Me and apparently Charles. So I love the guy. He's also right about digital TV

158
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:31,000
But it's not the fault of digital TV as much as the cable and satellite companies that keep adding more and more

159
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,400
Money generating content to a limited amount of bandwidth

160
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:42,760
I totally share Charles frustration. I have an enormous cable bill and the picture quality gets

161
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,400
Crappier and crappier every day

162
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,720
Charles, I feel your pain and

163
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,680
You should know you are clearly

164
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,680
Adam's brightest listener and a scruncher no doubt

165
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,800
Peter, what are you man? I forget have you told me?

166
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,880
Yeah, I got to tell you though. There's something different going on here. Peter, but we don't actually

167
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,440
Cable is is not very

168
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,960
Well penetrated throughout the UK because of the landscape, et cetera

169
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,360
And we do have these boxes over here which are called free view and these are digital

170
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:23,000
Boxes that take an analog signal off of your roof antenna or sometimes even if you're in a in a

171
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:30,520
Good reception area you can even just stick like rabbit ears on top of it and it receives one big fat analog signal

172
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,640
But that contains you know 20 or 30 different digital signals and that actually works quite well

173
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,600
It's very popular. I think there's like 15 million of those things sold in the UK

174
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,560
You pay once you pay like 50 50 pounds or whatever, so it's like let's just say 80 or 90 bucks maybe

175
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:52,840
And you take it home and you've got instant channels instead of your BBC one and two and and maybe you get your channel four

176
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,440
All of a sudden you got 20 channels to choose from and it does work and the reception really is quite okay

177
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,800
I forgot to tell you by the way at the top of the hour a top of the hour of body

178
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
All right, I got to go shoot myself

179
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,800
At the beginning of the show is what I meant

180
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,800
I

181
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:34,840
Played love and a bottle by Lee coolter and I just I don't want to say that it had a very just and timbre lake feel to it

182
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,320
Didn't know what you think and it wasn't someone bringing him over to the UK. I wouldn't mind seeing one of his shows

183
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,120
to reach Adam in America

184
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,760

185
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,760

For Adam in great Britain

191
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560

00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,560

199
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,160
Thanks for calling the daily source code goodbye. Oh, oh, hold on a scruncher

200
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:22,440
Hi, Adam. This is Whitney Hoffman from the LD podcast

201
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:30,840
I've been noticing that there are a lot of people wanting about lack of link love or where's their pod show contract and they're doing such a great job

202
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:36,680
How come you're not noticing them in different comments that they're sending to you and I thought really what we need here is

203
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:44,440
List of rules or etiquette rules that we can all abide by to just trying and keep everything polite and

204
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,080
Step here's my version see what you think

205
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:56,120
Welcome children to the church of podcast and we have put together the following command and said that we all

206
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,480
milleted peace and harmony in the pod us here

207
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,960
Adam Curry is the pod father who helped bring us a pod show in the pod safe music network

208
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,840
There shall be no other pod fathers beforehand

209
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:17,240
That shall not work so false promises of other networks and shall honor the daily source code is the origin of the pod us here itself

210
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,000
That shall work to the name of the pod father and bay your tape for friend and any intention

211
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,800
Jesus to bestow up on you or your shell

212
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:32,840
That shall not covet thy neighbors touch a contract given time good content and audience

213
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,000
You too, maybe 14 enough to become part of the holy network

214
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:45,400
Remember the importance of the PME in pod camp and other podcasters need us and keep such gift together's whole way

215
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:53,720
Honor the pod father and lady Patricia said that your days in the pod school will be long and it may win the favor of the pod

216
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,120
Father and spouse

217
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,240
That shall not implicitly discytler podcasters no sending the spam

218
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,640
But you should fill up podcasters as you would want them to change you in time

219
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:13,160
That shall label that podcasters clean your own simplicity so they may be deemed safe for the workplace

220
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,480
Or of small fry in the car

221
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:23,480
That shall keep thy parameters between 30 and 60 seconds in the pod us fear so that all may play a listen with

222
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:31,080
That shall respect thy own talent and manage thy own brand and not leave it to others to do so for you

223
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:38,200
That shall respect the podcasters community elite when they show you love and thank them accordingly

224
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:46,600
That shall not cover thy neighbors listeners, but see to improve the podcasters and cultivate it by own following

225
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,240
That shall be honest and in particular with any dealings with fellow podcasters and see to bring

226
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,200
Harmony in the podisphere and

227
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:02,280
That shall not batch of the pod father, but contents are linked by our and shall be prepared to deal with

228
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:09,160
Bansions from the Holy Land of the D.A.C. if you break this command man, so ended our lesson

229
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,960
Anyway Adam, that's my view on things that we should all be treating each other

230
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,680
Kindly in the podisphere and

231
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,320
If you're doing a good job eventually everything else that you want will come

232
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:31,160
Thanks again for everything and for playing my past comments on the air. I really appreciate it

233
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,440
oh

234
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,760
Well just like the real ten commandments. There's some flaws in yours

235
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,440
I do appreciate it by the way. I did of course have to think of Joseph Jaffee

236
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,320
Not did you think bend over bitch?

237
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,680
I had to think of Joseph when I heard that. I disagree

238
00:17:53,160 --> 00:18:00,280
You know, I think that's very much taking pod casting to through a blogging route and I don't really like that

239
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,560
That's what I think a lot of you know what pod casting has become which I think is a shame really

240
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Because it's you know

241
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,960
I'm doing this for listeners if those listeners happen to be other podcasters great of course

242
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,040
And there'll always be something relevant for I hope all listeners and I hope listeners who aren't

243
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:26,120
Interested in making podcasters or what pod casting is just want to listen to show or some entertainment or just a half hour of whatever

244
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:33,000
You know, that's the people I'm doing it for and and I think that everyone will want to listen to a little bit of

245
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,640
Information about some other makeup of the audience

246
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:42,440
To me pod casting and really independently produced media whether it's video whether it's audio

247
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,040
It's about the audience and blogging which is you know, we have a blogger sphere that's where we have a pot of sphere

248
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:53,720
That seems like a little clickish, you know like a circle jerk of people just talking amongst themselves

249
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,440
I say yeah, I listen to your show. You listen to my show. Yeah, I read your blogs read my blog. Yeah, link here blog. Yeah, that's like

250
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,200
I don't come that's not in my DNA. That's not where I come from

251
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:08,040
Everyone who's listening is a listener and I know for darn sure

252
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,720
Thank you by the way for keeping those profiles coming into the voicemail

253
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,840
I'm saving him. I'm gonna do a show one day just all voicemail profiles just so we can all introduce ourselves to each other

254
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,120
So if you haven't done so send one in because it'll be a long show

255
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,320
That's for sure

256
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,360
It'll it'll probably be a separate podcast. I'll have to break it up into bits

257
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,560
So anyway, so yeah, I'm not too down with with all that yeah, just the circle jerkness of it all

258
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,440
Hey, you know David Epilito is that guitar man from New York who I like very much

259
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,560
I love the I love the songs he does. I love what he does in central park although I've never seen him perform live

260
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:46,840
I know I will that won't be too long when you know we will hook up eventually and I talk about him

261
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,840
Frequently on the daily source code and I got a piece of feedback that really blew me away

262
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,840
I would not expect anyone

263
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,760
To respond like this hey Adam this chat from Plato's Bullet hope things are going well with you

264
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,880
I just wanted to chime in on a few things actually just one thing really

265
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
But every show you do you promote this

266
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,600
David Epilito that guitar man from central park you always compare him to the Bob Dylan of our time

267
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Uh-oh, no, I say he is the Bob Dylan of our time

268
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,640
I never said that I never compared him to the Bob Dylan of our time that would mean that there already is one

269
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:29,080
No, I think he is you know Bob Dylan he had some very catchy tunes, but I think it was really about the lyrics and what he was saying

270
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:37,240
And and having the balls to say what he was saying and I think you're wrong on that after listening to a bunch of his shows and everything

271
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,040
I really don't I don't see any comparison the Bob Dylan at all Bob Dylan

272
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,080
Created some amazing lyrics back in the day and I hold on dude

273
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,440
You're gonna tell me the Tom Cruise scares me isn't a fantastic lyric of our time of today

274
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,960
Sorry to say I saw him in Springfield at the Illinois State Fair a couple years ago

275
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:05,240
And I must say it was the worst concert I've ever been to but I did like his original stuff and and back in the 60s when he he was really when he's lyrics

276
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,640
Men something David Epilito doesn't have an ounce of talent that Bob Dylan ever had

277
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:15,640
David Epilito is the weird alien anchor Vic of our time. I think that's oh no, no, no, no, no

278
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,560
Now weirdo yankovic is something completely different and weirdo yankovic of our time is still weirdo yankovic

279
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,840
meant to say

280
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,480
But he comes up with some good guitar licks, but that's it really his lyrics are just parodies

281
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,000
Just like weirdo

282
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,120
He doesn't really have any talent. I think a third grade of dude just as well

283
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:39,640
But he does something for some reason have a great following and he's just that guy out there who hates the bush administration

284
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:46,840
And he wants everybody to you know make love not war and all that bullshit from the 60s that died out fast and

285
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,920
Obviously doesn't have a place for it. I'm gonna make a guess right now

286
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,320
Just listening to this I listen to how harsh you are dude

287
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:03,080
A third grader could do what he does. I don't think so. I don't think a third grader could come up with this kind of material

288
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,080
He has no talent all he wants is that hippie bullshit about make love not war. Oh, I'm sorry

289
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,200
I'm so sorry. I'm kind of for that and I'm no hippie

290
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,520
And he's just one of these guys that hates the bush administration. Well, there's a lot of these guys

291
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,880
That hate the bush administration and I'm not even counting myself as one of them, but

292
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:32,440
You know, there's a lot of people that disagree with the administration. I'm just going to guess

293
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:38,520
I'm gonna take a wild guess and say you're a scruncher in today's society

294
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,320
So if you want to hear other viewpoints like that

295
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,480
I encourage your listeners to check out Plato's bullet on the Potio network

296
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,920
Thanks a lot. I'm a scruncher. Yeah, told you

297
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,280
Scruncher. I'll check it out dude. Plato's bullet. Okay, I'm glad you're on

298
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,480
Potio plus on the pdn. We'll definitely check it out

299
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,920
Have to agree

300
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,600
No, actually I can't I can only disagree and by the way

301
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,400
He has pretty cool friends

302
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,040
Hey Adam David a belito here in New York City from thatcaptardman.com

303
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,560
I know you'll appreciate this a friend of mine called me up. He's a musical legend and

304
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,120
He wanted to say something on your show. He wanted to say something to anyone who would listen

305
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,440
He told me because he knows that with as much laughs and as much fun as I love to have

306
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,960
And as much as I love to find new music and get it out there that we want music to make a difference again

307
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,320
And he's the guy that brought the Beatles to America. I told him the daily source code was the best bet in town

308
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,320
So here he is

309
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,920
But David a belito is doing it

310
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,960
But I do love the company

311
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
It's so beautiful purpose

312
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,640
The new we knew yorkers

313
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,720
Hopefully have discovered it had to take you to go to the home

314
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,280
Central Park

315
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,360
Thanks Adam man. Look me up when you get to New York, right? Definitely dude

316
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,920
Definitely cool. It did burn steam

317
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,240
I

318
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,440
Wonder has he actually listened to anything on the pots? How old is Sid burn steam these days?

319
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,920
He's got to be pushing 70

320
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,760
Oh, we totally totally need to get him involved with the pod save music network. How cool would it be?

321
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,600
Let's do a Sid burn steam show

322
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:32,840
Well, he just pulls out the songs that he likes from the pod save music network David. We've got to put this together man. That would be so awesome

323
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,480
We'll get a producer for him even just having listen to stuff and if he likes it then

324
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:45,560
We put it in his show. Wouldn't that be awesome? Sid burn steam dot pod show dot com da a girl can dream

325
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,400
Yesterday I was asked to talk about my dad which I

326
00:24:52,520 --> 00:25:03,880
Admittedly don't do very often on the daily source code and I talked about a lot of my feelings and if you want to you should probably go back and listen to four six three if you want to hear that and I you know

327
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,880
I was talking about listeners

328
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,520
And whenever I'm speaking, I really do feel like I'm talking to a group

329
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:17,880
The group I visualize is much smaller than than the group that is actually listening and I forget I forget that

330
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,040
Well, even my sister and Italy is listening

331
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,520
Hi Adam. It's your sister willow from Florence

332
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,800
I'm sending an audio comment since you specifically

333
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,920
Said that you wanted audio comments and not emails

334
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,920
Okay, anyway, it's obviously commenting on our father and what you said

335
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,280
I'd have to say that I agree with most of what you said

336
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,880
One thing struck me as odd that you said at a certain point now

337
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,880
I can't really remember I was listening to it on the way home. I was in a car with the kids

338
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,480
I think you said talking about kids. I think you said that he wanted

339
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,280
more other kids a wife other kids now that never

340
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,560
Never seemed to me to be that way. I mean, I always had the impression that the whole idea was yes

341
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:16,920
Reboot new life, but new life, you know, having being the single cool bachelors, whatever and

342
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,440
I always had the idea, you know that after a couple years like hmm right in my art sort of like, you know

343
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,440
Having a wife wasn't too bad after all and so

344
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,160
You know, he got his himself a wife, but I really don't think that

345
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:38,760
He was waiting for more children. So that the fact that that of course, then he does have another child, but I

346
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,880
I never had the impression that he would want it, you know, like he was when he was a child

347
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,760
Once the fact occurred once you know he thought he was gonna

348
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,920
Be a better father just time around. He was gonna have a second chance and I don't think that worked out either, but

349
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:04,840
Doesn't matter what I also wanted to say that yes, we've tried a lot and we've all given him, you know, whatever

350
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,840
We could give him and in the end I haven't given up

351
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,040
I've just decided not to expect anything anymore maybe that's

352
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,720
Maybe that is giving up and in my from my point of view, it's just you know if I don't expect anything

353
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,920
I won't be disappointed you have one big disappointment today that you sort of decide

354
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,480
I'm not gonna expect anything anymore, but you know once you do that you just free

355
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,840
You know, and I feel you know, I feel I

356
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:41,000
For me that's the solution. I don't expect anything and so I don't know if your listeners care

357
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,160
You care

358
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:48,680
This was just my two cents. Okay. Oh, and and a quick promo

359
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:56,680

00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,680
www.curry.it

361
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,200
Okay, have a nice day. Bye. Joe Bella

362
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,200
Man, this to me is a true historic moment in podcasting. I mean, I could not

363
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,240
It was so cool yesterday

364
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,400
Yeah, it came in last night and I heard this and I like wow, man

365
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,600
This is awesome. This is really cool. Thank you Willow. I

366
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,560
Really really appreciate that

367
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,120
Yeah, and and you know what in hindsight, I think you're right

368
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:30,360
It wasn't a reboot for new kids, but once of course we knew that that they were gonna have kids

369
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,120
And once that came along. I think you're right. I think he had his and if actually even said that he even said

370
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,760
I'm gonna do better this time. It's like well fuck you

371
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,720
But I think you're right. I think just

372
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,840
Learning to not expect anything is probably the best way

373
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,200
To deal with it, but I'm not alone then and I knew I wasn't and

374
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,200
But wow, what an interesting way to have this conversation

375
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,440
I love you fantastic

376
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,160
More comments about this about this discussion came in as well

377
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:13,800
Hey, Adam, this is the philosophy guy. I wanted to comment about your comments about your dad

378
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,320
I too a child of divorce my dad decided to

379
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,000
reboot his life when I was six so it kind of let us

380
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,920
High and dry and he went out and

381
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,440
Did his thing and left my mom and

382
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,880
My self and my sisters alone for a long time and

383
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
So we never I never really knew him

384
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,280
We did a few things together, but nothing that I would

385
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,480
Write home about

386
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,000
So I feel I feel you're you're paying sometimes

387
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,360
But you know what it taught me it taught me that

388
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,160
What's important is how

389
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:05,800
I treat my own family, you know my my three kids in my wife and

390
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
When I feel like

391
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,200
Rebooty my life you know, I just have I remember that

392
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,920
You know, it's not about me. It's about the family and I mean we smack that kid in the background

393
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,720
Tell the kid to shut up. I never want to have

394
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I never want to have

395
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,120
Sorry about that. I had to

396
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,160
I never want to

397
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,160
Leave my kids the way I was left. So

398
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,240
I get that sense

399
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,440
Adam that you're the same way that you sound like you have a wonderful relationship with

400
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Christina and

401
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Your wife Patricia and

402
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,960
And that it's it's family that matters and

403
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,720
I wish you all the best and

404
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,360
I can understand if you don't want to talk about those painful things

405
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,360
I know that sometimes I don't but

406
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,040
Sometimes it's it's good so take care

407
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,960
And God bless all right philosophy guy

408
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,040
Yep

409
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,280
You know what I think we all do have that if you've never had the feeling of wanting or needing a reboot

410
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,400
Maybe you should just try it the trick of course is to do it with your family and we've done that several times

411
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,720
We rebooted from the United States to

412
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
Europe and after

413
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,800
Patricia got ill we definitely did a full-blown reset you know delete the email

414
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,800
Cut the credit card sell all the crap. We did a major reboot when we came to the UK

415
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,120
And that is a lot of fun. We really enjoyed and it may be it's not for everybody but we really we really do enjoy it

416
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,120
And yeah, of course

417
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:59,080
And you know and every parent has that moment where you mouth opens and your own parents come out, you know, it freaks you out

418
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:04,120
But a lot of it is good and of course I got a lot of values from from my both my parents

419
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:12,120
But I don't know maybe maybe I was expecting to maybe I was set up incorrectly by trial literature

420
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,400
As of what to expect from the the perfect family life. Hmm. Yeah, that's possible

421
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,560
Not everybody has the nine to five job my my dad certainly didn't

422
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,640
So you know, I guess it is a balance of everything and sometimes it works and maybe sometimes it doesn't I you know

423
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,640
I'm it's not painful for me

424
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:37,640
It's just I like I don't know what to say it's like that's it. I guess. I just accepted. I'm I'm I think I am more of a guy who just accepts stuff

425
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Like

426
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:46,120
