In just days, Podshow will unleash the all-new Podshow-plus network with all new features and functionality designed from feedback provided directly from you.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
From you, the audience, the audience, Podshow.com.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Change the world, win valuable prizes.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm getting ready for my addition on the new Podshow video show, Port City PD.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
A pop show?

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You want to be on a pop show?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yep.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Have you seen a pearl?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The story?

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The acting?

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The sound effects?

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's amazing!

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm trying out to be on the new show for as you know Pearl.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm the wave of go-for destruction.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You think it's appropriate for a go-for from bedtime stories?

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My kids love to want to be on Port City PD.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Pearl?

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If it offended, then don't watch.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But for right now, check out my Judo Kick.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah!

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Happy, just introduce the show.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Sure.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Delta's Sierra Charlie.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Four.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Nine.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Three.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
With fifteen bags, the spring has stuck in our pants.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Sugar?

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And fifteen bags of toilet paper hanging from our cracks?

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We don't need no speaking sugar.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'd like to think I'm right.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
For the future.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
For the future.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Podshow is scary.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Sometimes an atom's all alone.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
He needs his love right there on the microphone.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So here she is, yes, the lady Patricia.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The same two heads are better than one.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And with this angel from above,

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
There's nothing that they both can't do.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
A make you wild as dreams come true.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So grab your earbuds and jam them in.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And let the fabulous show begin.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's Adam and Patricia.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes, Adam and Patricia.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Adam and the lady Patricia.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
She slept a car and she said she's caught and played in.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
To make them move from here.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This time it wasn't as if she was complaining.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This time it wasn't for me.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He tried to come and save her down.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
He tried to convince her she was wrong.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
She said I think you'll never understand.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let it go.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm sorry now.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm sorry now.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Let it get to go.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm not out.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm not out.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm not out.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
She screamed at him that she so tired of breathing.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
For anything in life.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm not having fun there.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm barely frustrated.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It comes just like a nap.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
She had it up and she felt that things were changing.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Comments that she was right.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
She thought no question no doubt.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And now I'm sure.

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Let it get to go.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm sorry now.

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm sorry now.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let it get to go.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm not out.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm not out.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm not out.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm not out.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm not out.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm sorry now.

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm sorry now.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Let it get to go.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm not out.

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm not out.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm not out.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let it get to go.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm not out.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm not out.

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm not out.

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Girl stuff.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You didn't like it?

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't like it.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You think of that girl with the glasses on Lisa.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Lisa Lopez.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You're not a real podcaster man.

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're not a real podcaster man.

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You're not a singer anymore.

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You don't want to sing anymore.

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's a baby source code for nine or three coming to you from the current curry cottage.

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Soon to be the former curry cottage.

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm going to call the new place the curry cottage.

103
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I have no idea.

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's a little too big maybe to be qualified as a.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's your perfect it is.

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That's what everybody says.

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Picture perfect.

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What?

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I don't know.

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Anyway.

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
To guess where they're from.

114
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Breakhouse.

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Guess where the girl that you just heard is from.

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's what I want to ask.

117
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay.

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Where's she from?

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah.

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You'll never guess.

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Germany.

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Well, I'll close actually.

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Switzerland.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh.

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah.

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This is this is a bunch of producers out there called ninety nine productions.

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Ninety nine ninety nine red balloons.

128

Four doxions.

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah.

Inc.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And.

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What they do is they have their own studio.

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And then if they find someone who's talented, then they just do a do a record with them.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And then try and try and make it.

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Make it happen.

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah.

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah.

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So they got a whole bunch of stuff on the fun.

Yeah.

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I like it.

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And I kind of like that song.

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
A little bit of the.

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Very good.

146
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I don't know.

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It sounded already like a hit.

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Like do I know this song?

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I think I already know this song.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And that's good.

151
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's what they did with her home.

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Will that work?

153
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Fuck.

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't know.

155
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
How exciting is that?

156
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yes.

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I don't know why isn't it working.

158
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And you know why it's Adam?

159
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yes Patricia.

160
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
They want to know in England.

161
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
People will come into the country.

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes.

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's not work.

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
They want to know the skills that people would bring to this country.

165
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Oh.

166
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
This.

167
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This is.

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm not working here.

169
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm just living here.

170
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I get I get paid in America.

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay.

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't do any work here.

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The only thing I've done here is I speed.

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah.

175
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I speed too much with.

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But in the future, they're going to see, you know, who immigrates to this country.

177
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
They're going to be very strict with that.

178
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And see if they can can bring a new skill.

179
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Now, you know, you're just see, I don't think it's for anybody.

180
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I think it's only for Romania and Bulgaria.

181
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's what I just said.

182
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm new.

183
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Who's they?

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The news.

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The news.

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What news?

187
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What news?

188
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What news?

189
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What news?

190
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, and to BBC owned by the government.

191
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Well, I think it's very good to look.

192
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You know, I do.

193
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm just saying, I don't know how to bring.

194
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I don't know how true that is is what I'm saying.

195
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't think it's a correct.

196
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Uh, report.

197
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's really correct.

198
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
They can't do that.

199
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You can't be part of the European Union and then say,

200
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But no one else can come in here.

201
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You can't do that.

202
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's like, that's like New Jersey saying,

203
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
If you're New York, I'm sorry.

204
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You can't come in.

205
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Well, that's not what they're saying.

206
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
To just say, can you bring something?

207
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Is it something?

208
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Can you add something to this country?

209
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Well, you're just going to.

210
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Just leech off of the system like you and I.

211
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Absolutely not.

212
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We we spend the money.

213
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Look, they may make a tougher.

214
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's true.

215
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah, that's good.

216
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But they can't stop anyone from coming in.

217
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
They just can't.

218
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That's not what they're saying.

219
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Anyone who wants to come here and has no job.

220
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You're fucking crazy.

221
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's so expensive here.

222
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah.

223
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You will die.

224
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah.

225
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You will die of starvation.

226
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It is very, very, very expensive here.

227
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah.

228
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Don't do it.

229
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yeah.

230
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I think that's, you know, keep the pound in.

231
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Keep the prices high.

232
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Keep all the riff rap out.

233
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah.

234
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
If you're not here for shopping.

235
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah.

236
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's what I was saying.

237
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Are you working here, sir?

238
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
No.

239
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm spending.

240
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
We're just shopping.

241
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That's all we're doing.

242
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Did you see their faces?

243
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's always okay.

244
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Well, yeah.

245
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Welcome.

246
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
How are you doing?

247
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Oh, that's good.

248
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Then welcome.

249
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Good morning.

250
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
How are you?

251
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Tata.

252
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah.

253
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
All right.

254
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So we've missed you on the show, huh?

255
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, did you?

256
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah.

257
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So busy.

258
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
No.

259
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Every single time I've done a show, you were too busy.

260
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And I was busy too without a staff.

261
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Sure.

262
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Because you are so busy.

263
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I have to do the other stuff.

264
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
In fact, just before we started the show, I got a phone call.

265
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Which delayed the start of the, you want to know what that was?

266
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
We launched BT Pod Show.com.

267
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So yesterday, we, or we unleashed, we unleashed the new Pod Show Plus.

268
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah.

269
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And now we have the English version, the UK version, English, the UK version at BT Pod Show.com.

270
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And so this morning, the chairman of BT, the Dutch guy, Ben Provine, was on the BBC

271
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Breakfast.

272
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Which, of course, I missed.

273
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I didn't see it.

274
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I didn't know.

275
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I didn't know.

276
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And it was talking about it.

277
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
If anyone recorded that, I'd love to see it.

278
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I went to the BBC, he's like, what is it?

279
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
They have a podcast service, but they don't actually.

280
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
They're not using it very much.

281
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
They show you the highlights of the news.

282
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I want to see the whole program, you know?

283
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Like, let me just scroll through that.

284
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So they're freaking out because they found some questionable content on the show at BT Headquarters.

285
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Really?

286
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah.

287
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And so, you know, I'm not in the censorship at all.

288
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's, you know, I think everything goes.

289
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Within, you know, within some, like, we don't want pornography on our site as an example.

290
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
That's, you know, we don't want, and forget about whether it's legal, illegal.

291
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm just not interested, you know, go somewhere else for that.

292
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'll send you some good links if you want, so.

293
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So then there's this show.

294
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's, it was a called sneeze wart.

295
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And I'm like, oh, this is a, you know, it's a very questionable podcast.

296
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And I'm looking through all these episodes.

297
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Like, there's some, some girl, you know, dancing sexy.

298
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What a close-on, even.

299
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I can't believe this.

300
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah.

301
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What is, this can't really be true.

302
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't understand that.

303
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Come over here, because I found the episode they're talking about.

304
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You remember Leah from Big Brother?

305
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah.

306
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You're going to have to come over here, huh?

307
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Because I can't turn them on over.

308
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Do you have your glasses?

309
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah.

310
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah.

311
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Let me see if I can see it.

312
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh, I can see it.

313
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Okay.

314
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
There you go.

315
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You can see it.

316
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So the show, by the time you hear this podcast, this episode will be gone.

317
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So you don't, don't, don't go looking for it.

318
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah.

319
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This is Leah from Big Brother.

320
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Oh, I'm going to give you some audio here.

321
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Do I have sound with this?

322
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Sneeze word.

323
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Let's see.

324
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I hope I have audio.

325
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh, my God.

326
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh, my God.

327
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah, but that's what she was talking about.

328
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
She didn't do any more, and she was actually a shame doll.

329
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Dude, she has to do it.

330
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I don't know if it's new, but after seeing this.

331
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Looks very new.

332
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah.

333
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh, my God.

334
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Well, yeah.

335
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Hello.

336
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh, my God.

337
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But now, but you're saying it's a hot porno.

338
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I have to say it's a porno.

339
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yeah, it's hot.

340
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The day before yesterday.

341
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yes.

342
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I was upstairs, you know, cleaning my face.

343
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And I always do, you know, put just like Leah got her face clean right there.

344
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
She needs.

345
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I was in my bedroom, and I always switch a TV on, you know, for, you know, just to get in the mood for sleeping.

346
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yeah.

347
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So, and I had it switch on BBC 4.

348
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Mm-hmm.

349
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Well, they had sort of a sex show there, but it was telling people, you know,

350
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
yeah, it was more teaching people about sex, about what happens, you know, because

351
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Well, then it's educational, then it's okay.

352
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's educational.

353
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah.

354
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You have no idea.

355
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It was beyond porno.

356
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But wait a minute.

357
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Were they, was horrible?

358
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Were they really?

359
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yes.

360
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Were they showing fully erecting?

361
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Everything.

362
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Full erecting.

363
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Close up.

364
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah.

365
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Because that's actually illegal.

366
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What do you think is?

367
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Where the, the combos.

368
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh, God.

369
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It was seemingly.

370
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
He was coming out.

371
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The guy was coming.

372
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So, he was, but close up ejaculating.

373
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yes.

374
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Thank you.

375
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
There you go.

376
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
My dear.

377
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And he was close up.

378
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Because that's, hold on a second.

379
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That's the point out of it.

380
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's the difference.

381
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
If you say coming versus ejaculating, that's the difference.

382
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That's the difference right there.

383
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Well, you know.

384
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah.

385
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So, did it turn you on?

386
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
No.

387
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Well, I mean, you know, then it's, it's okay.

388
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Hmm.

389
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Well, all I know is, there's two things.

390
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It was.

391
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Let me answer.

392
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Gosh, you never let me answer the question.

393
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I wasn't done.

394
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Educational.

395
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yes.

396
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's what it was.

397
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
There are two things.

398
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
In the UK as far as I know, you're not allowed to show a fully erect penis on television.

399
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah.

400
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I don't know why.

401
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I don't know the problem is, but that's not loud.

402
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't care about that.

403
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The problem here is that's, that's a stolen video.

404
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That's someone.

405
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That's a, that's a, that's a part of a movie.

406
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That's copyright.

407
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So, that has to come off.

408
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That's the real problem.

409
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah, that's the problem.

410
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So, but, but I don't think it's the, I think we've, we've all seen it now.

411
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You know, we've all seen it by.

412
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Are we still surprised?

413
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I think so.

414
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
We are.

415
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yeah.

416
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I've seen so much.

417
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Especially on the internet.

418
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I mean.

419
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Are you really?

420
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Is that what you're doing on your computer these days?

421
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Show me.

422
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You're showing me.

423
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You're showing me.

424
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Show me.

425
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Show me.

426
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Show me.

427
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Show me.

428
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This is awesome.

429
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah.

430
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Okay.

431
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So, what we're going to talk about.

432
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
We had so many things that we've ever since I got back.

433
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
We said, yeah, we'll talk about this.

434
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
We'll talk.

435
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh, um.

436
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Well, first of all.

437
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yes.

438
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You're not in a good mood.

439
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What do you mean?

440
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm not in a good mood.

441
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Well, I know to the, you are very tense.

442
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Well, downstairs.

443
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You just accused me of fucking up five years of our life.

444
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Huh?

445
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Just before the show.

446
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Oh, in Holland.

447
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yeah.

448
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You, you, you tagged me.

449
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You always tagged me because I'm Dutch.

450
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
No.

451
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I just said.

452
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yes, I do.

453
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You're right.

454
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah.

455
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So, that's why you say, why do you want to be there then?

456
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You know, I didn't want, I don't want to be there.

457
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Oh, but then you wanted to be there because you, you thought you had something going there.

458
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And you wanted to stay there for what?

459
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Right.

460
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
But you attacked me.

461
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So, and so that's why I'm not in a good mood.

462
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah.

463
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So, don't attack the Dutch, okay?

464
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yeah.

465
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
No.

466
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I am attacking the Dutch.

467
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm not talking about that you are in a bad mood now.

468
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You are in a bad mood the last couple of days.

469
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Not in a bad mood.

470
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm busy.

471
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yeah.

472
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You're very busy.

473
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Right now, you're putting me in a bad mood by saying this.

474
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Why?

475
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Well, because I'm not in a bad mood.

476
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Throw it out.

477
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Come on.

478
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm busy.

479
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm fucking busy.

480
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's what I mean.

481
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And when you are busy, you are so focused.

482
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yeah.

483
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah.

484
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Because that's what you always are.

485
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You're very focused on what you're doing.

486
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
There's no space for anything.

487
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But listen, I'm 42, which I consider to be pretty old.

488
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You know, compared, I remember when my dad was 40.

489
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm like, dude, you're fucking old.

490
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yeah.

491
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And we're really trying to build something here.

492
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And now is the time to make it happen.

493
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I know.

494
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And I'm tired.

495
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I travel around the globe.

496
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But what?

497
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's amazing what you guys are doing.

498
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I think it's wonderful.

499
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yeah.

500
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
We haven't even had time to enjoy it.

501
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah.

502
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
We've been working.

503
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah.

504
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So.

505
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm very proud of you.

506
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And you know, Christine and I do understand it.

507
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And it mean, well, we shop.

508
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Yeah.

509
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You never hear me about that, dude.

510
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You never hear me.

511
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm never grumpy.

512
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm just joking.

513
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Never ever.

514
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No, no.

515
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
There you are.

516
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Yeah.

517
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I knew Luke.

518
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What do you mean?

519
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That's cheap.

520
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So, do you know how many people can afford new look either?

521
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Oh.

522
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You know, you guys are fortunate.

523
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I know.

524
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Just to you.

525
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So, you got complaints?

526
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Uh, sex.

527
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You've had sex for me.

528
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I've given you sex.

529
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
As by the time I go to bed, you're already asleep.

530
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
True.

531
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah.

532
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yeah.

533
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Or see, here's something.

534
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You know, Patricia doesn't like to have sex when the teenagers awake.

535
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
No.

536
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
No.

537
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Turns me off.

538
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah.

539
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Okay.

540
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But I know that she's still, you know, with a door open and everything.

541
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't like that.

542
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Okay. Well, so does that limit your choices?

543
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
When do you, you can have sex or not?

544
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I always with children.

545
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So, but so, please don't say that it's my fault.

546
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah.

547
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But she's sleeping over sometimes.

548
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But let me tell you.

549
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
She knows exactly what's going on.

550
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The minute you close that door, click the big fucking lock goes on.

551
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You think she doesn't know?

552
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Are you really kidding yourself?

553
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Do you think that she isn't having sex?

554
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh, I don't want to know that.

555
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah.

556
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Exactly.

557
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
She doesn't want to know it.

558
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I don't want to know it.

559
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yeah, but of course I know it.

560
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yeah.

561
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Well, there you go.

562
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Okay.

563
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So, what's going on with all these people?

564
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Well, excuse me, before you move on.

565
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Are you sexually satisfied in our relationship or not?

566
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Because people are wondering about this now.

567
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
No.

568
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yes, I am, my darling.

569
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Be honest, if you're not, you know, just let me, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, lots of people would,

570
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
would happy to come by and help you out.

571
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm sure.

572
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Well, talking about that.

573
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Uh-oh.

574
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm going to do.

575
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Do you tell them yet?

576
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
No, I was sworn to secrecy.

577
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
All right.

578
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
All right. All right.

579
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Well, I'm busy changing the world, winning valuable prizes.

580
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You know, don't have time to sexually satisfy my partner.

581
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You decide to make it even busier and go do something yourself.

582
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Well, I do have a crazy guy in my arms in the future.

583
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Because I'm going to do a strictly condensing in Holland.

584
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Yeah, in Holland.

585
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
In Holland.

586
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And that is dancing with this.

587
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
This is the stars.

588
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So, let me ask you, Miss Pai.

589
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah.

590
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Since you won't change your last name to mine.

591
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Why did you decide to do this?

592
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Why are you going to go to Holland?

593
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Well, you know it.

594
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
To do a television program.

595
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm not doing for the attention, because I don't like that, actually.

596
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And I don't need it.

597
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Then why are you doing it?

598
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Well, I had sort of going from summer to the winter,

599
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
and having a lot of things on my mind,

600
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
and being busy with trying to find a house and all these things,

601
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
and disappointments and days, and that, and falling through.

602
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I was...

603
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Your life is so horrible, isn't it?

604
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Oh, no, no.

605
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I was a little bit in a dip.

606
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I didn't feel well.

607
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
My body didn't feel good.

608
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
There was no energy left,

609
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and you went to America.

610
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
My parents were here, which was a lot of fun.

611
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And the people of that program were calling me.

612
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And my mom was in the standing next to me,

613
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
who heard the conversation.

614
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
This is when I was in the San Francisco.

615
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yes, and you were in San Francisco,

616
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and they were asked me if I was interested to do that.

617
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And I said, well, I have to think about it,

618
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and I'll call you back.

619
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And my mom starts to jump up and down.

620
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Oh, you have to do it.

621
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's such good.

622
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
We enjoy it.

623
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And everybody's watching it in Holland.

624
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And they think you can do it.

625
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And it's good for you.

626
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And I said, well, you know,

627
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I love dancing, though.

628
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You know, I don't want to sing,

629
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
but dancing, I always wanted to dance.

630
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Although I've never did it before.

631
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Well, dance, ballroom dancing, nothing.

632
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You know, not with a partner.

633
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So I thought, you know, maybe it's good.

634
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Maybe it's good to challenge my body.

635
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You know, because I'm not a very healthy woman.

636
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And see what I can do.

637
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And give me a boost.

638
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You're very healthy woman.

639
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
What are you talking about?

640
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Well, my heart is not.

641
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You know, and sometimes you're afraid of your heart.

642
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Because you don't know what you can do.

643
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
How far you can, you know, push it.

644
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You're always, it's always hanging above your head.

645
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You know, and for this, I'm very healthy.

646
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And my muscles are okay.

647
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And I thought, maybe I'll do it for myself.

648
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And see what I can do.

649
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And maybe it gives me a boost.

650
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And then, um, I think it gives you a boost.

651
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Then why?

652
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
After that.

653
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
No, well, after that.

654
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You think, wow, you know, I can do that too.

655
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And it gives me good feeling.

656
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yes.

657
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But that's why I'm doing it.

658
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I totally.

659
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So I had one rehearsal this week.

660
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And I heard that was a couple of very good guys.

661
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Well, hold on.

662
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
First tell me.

663
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So yeah, tell me about your dance partner.

664
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Because don't you get a professional, though.

665
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Yeah.

666
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So my, I told my sister, Ivan, who was, was always watching that.

667
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Who was a professional tango dancer herself?

668
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Not at all.

669
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
But she said, oh, that two guys were really good looking.

670
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Very, very good.

671
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
They're sensational.

672
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
They've got a lot of passion in them.

673
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You should have one of them.

674
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
So I had a request.

675
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And I said, you know, my, my family says it.

676
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I have to choose this one.

677
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You were about to say, my husband has given me enough sex.

678
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So could I have that Remco guy?

679
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That's, that's what I thought you were going to say.

680
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
No.

681
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And so, and I got the one that I want.

682
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I got the one that I want.

683
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And I had to make my arms this week.

684
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah.

685
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
My got 28 years old.

686
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah.

687
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Yeah.

688
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Mm-hmm.

689
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And how do you go?

690
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It went very well.

691
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I try to make me jealous, because I'm not bothered.

692
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm not bothered.

693
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Face, I'm not bothered.

694
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Face is not.

695
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Pain is not bothered.

696
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Pain is, look, pain is, my pain is face.

697
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm not bothered.

698
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm not bothered.

699
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm not bothered.

700
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Oh, God.

701
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Walling out of your crook.

702
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yeah.

703
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Of my crook.

704
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's a stool.

705
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Yeah, I know.

706
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
No, that.

707
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So, um, no, I'm not making it.

708
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Because we're not jealous.

709
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
We're not jealous.

710
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You like it.

711
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You always say it's good for you.

712
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I haven't seen it.

713
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Good for you.

714
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yeah, good for you.

715
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
No, I'm very happy.

716
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yeah.

717
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It's just that it adds so much planning, planning,

718
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
dimension, because you want me to do it.

719
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Yeah, right now.

720
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
To stop everything and start flying you around.

721
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Yeah.

722
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So, yeah.

723
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'll just like you when you're going.

724
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You know, there's so many things.

725
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Yeah.

726
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
But that's me going.

727
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It's a go on.

728
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
That's a big difference between me going.

729
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And you really.

730
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And I know when mommy is going.

731
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Yeah.

732
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
And the hardest thing is that, you know, you want.

733
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You want to have another pilot with you.

734
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And that's the hardest thing is to find another pilot during the week,

735
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
because most of them work.

736
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Yeah.

737
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So, I think if you just take your chances with me.

738
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I didn't do it.

739
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yeah.

740
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Yeah.

741
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So, now it's going to be fun.

742
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It's harder than I thought, actually.

743
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Now, what dances do you have to do?

744
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I have to do a waltz.

745
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
That's a waltz, isn't it?

746
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It's for Christmas show and a new year show.

747
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So, it's not as long as it's.

748
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Well, no, no, it's silent night.

749
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yeah.

750
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
They're making a waltz.

751
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It sounds like a bit disappointed about it.

752
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It's very old fashioned.

753
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Well, why don't you tell me when I'm going to the song?

754
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I think I'm going to talk about it.

755
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Well, it's Christmas.

756
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So, I know that maybe that that show will be a little bit more Christmasy.

757
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
But I have to talk about that other show.

758
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And the other one is sort of...

759
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Here's what you do.

760
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Here's what you do.

761
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You say, I've got a great idea for a song.

762
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I'd like to do a waltz, too.

763
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I have a pot safer piece.

764
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
One, two, three.

765
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
One, two, three.

766
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah, it is.

767
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
You can do a waltz.

768
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
One, two, three.

769
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Yeah, it is.

770
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You can do a waltz.

771
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
One, two, three.

772
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
One, two, three.

773
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
One, two, three.

774
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
No, no, no.

775
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
No, no, no.

776
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Okay.

777
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
All right.

778
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So, I hope that finds me something else because it's a bit...

779
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Silent night sounds dreary.

780
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Well, Silent night, okay.

781
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
But then the other one is South American.

782
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's very nice.

783
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It's...

784
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
But still, it's...

785
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
How about your...

786
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
My mum...

787
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
You love it?

788
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And I think I forgot that.

789
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Can't you do mumbo eetleano?

790
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
That's a mumbo.

791
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
This is...

792
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I think this is a zember.

793
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Who gives a shit?

794
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
My mumbo's zember.

795
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Who cares?

796
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You think the audience care?

797
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You don't even know the difference between a mumbo...

798
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
A mumbo, a mumbo...

799
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
But do you know what I mean?

800
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I mean, this is crazy.

801
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Do I have...

802
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Do I have mumbo?

803
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I don't have mumbo.

804
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You think...

805
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Hmm...

806
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Not here.

807
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Yeah.

808
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
But you know what I'm saying?

809
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It's like...

810
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Who gives a shit?

811
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Whether it's a mumbo or a somber?

812
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And they'll be your song.

813
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
They'll be kind of cool.

814
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
No, they don't do that.

815
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Because there's a big orchestra there.

816
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It's playing live.

817
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Yeah.

818
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Just...

819
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I mean, exactly the way they do it here.

820
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
They have to do it.

821
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Do it.

822
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Do it.

823
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Do it.

824
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yeah.

825
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I have no idea what it is.

826
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
That's right.

827
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You're talking about it.

828
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Your pass I do it was really lovely.

829
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I said do it.

830
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Well, I told them that you want to do it too.

831
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You want to try it.

832
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
No, that's not true.

833
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
That's...

834
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
You always say when you're sitting on the couch.

835
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
No.

836
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I can do that.

837
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I can.

838
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
But I'm only going to do it for Bruce Forsyte.

839
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm not going to do it for a Roman Brown stator.

840
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm sorry.

841
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I'm not going to invite you here.

842
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Not yet.

843
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
That's right.

844
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I'm not going to accept the invitation.

845
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I will not.

846
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I will not.

847
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Nothing.

848
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I will...

849
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I will have nothing more to do with Dutch media.

850
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Done.

851
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Especially those fuckers.

852
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I don't...

853
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I haven't forgotten RTL4 cock suckers.

854
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Yeah.

855
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Enjoy your show.

856
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
But...

857
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
That guy's already gone.

858
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Yeah.

859
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
There are already other people sitting there.

860
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Yeah, but you know what I mean.

861
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Yeah.

862
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
You know what I mean.

863
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
It's just the whole general thing.

864
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I know.

865
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I know how you think.

866
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Yeah.

867
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I mean, I'm not angry.

868
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It's done.

869
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Mm-hmm.

870
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Do you want to mean?

871
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Yeah.

872
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Well, I will probably...

873
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
We'll never be done because I'm Dutch.

874
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Yeah.

875
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And you...

876
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Never be Dutch.

877
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
But you know, you will...

878
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You want to become English.

879
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I'm getting your British passport.

880
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Uh-huh.

881
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
When you were British passport, then you're done.

882
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Then they probably want to ask me for...

883
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
For strictly condensing.

884
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Well, let me do a commercial.

885
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I'm going to go on a second.

886
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Ten lessons.

887
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I've learned a lot surfing internet.

888
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Number one.

889
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Entering your email address on some websites is an open invitation to spam.

890
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Number two.

891
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Before forwarding an email about the ghost of a dead boy appearing in the theatrical film.

892
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Three men in a baby.

893
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Check Snopes.com.

894
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
First.

895
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Number three.

896
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Spyware.

897
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Then forms you that you have spyware.

898
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
There's not very helpful.

899
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Number four.

900
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
The FBI will never send you an email warning about your visiting 40 illegal websites.

901
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
They'll simply bust down your door.

902
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Never, ever, Google the Toronto-based quartet.

903
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
The Bare Nicoladies on a computer at work.

904
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Number six.

905
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And Microsoft are not tracking this email.

906
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And forwarding it to 15 other people will not get Walt Disney signed to send you free passes to Walt Disney World.

907
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
There is no such thing as a national do not email registry.

908
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Number eight.

909
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
There is no ousted prints in Bangladesh willing to share $15 million with you.

910
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Closing one porn pop-up window opens 15 more.

911
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And number ten.

912
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I think as your service provider will solve most of these problems.

913
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Unfortunately, the remaining few will take some common sense.

914
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I've got to get your EarthLink email service.

915
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So you actually were interested in the pills that were you got spam with like, what was that again?

916
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Like some...

917
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
The Xanx.

918
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
The Xanx.

919
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It's a fucking drug.

920
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
They're sending me those.

921
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Yeah, it's called spam.

922
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Yeah.

923
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You would actually save one.

924
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
You're like, oh, that's interesting.

925
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
That's cheap.

926
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It's nice for drugs.

927
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Yeah, but that's not good, man.

928
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You don't know what you know.

929
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
No, that's what they say.

930
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Of course.

931
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You never know who makes them.

932
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Yeah.

933
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Or if it's even what it says it is.

934
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Yeah.

935
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Maybe it's not.

936
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Give me an update on Paul McCartney.

937
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Because while I was gone, shit really hit the fan, didn't it?

938
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Oh my god.

939
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It's nasty.

940
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And why...

941
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
How does it come that people when they divorce?

942
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It's such a mess.

943
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Can they just divorce?

944
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
No, that's the press, huh?

945
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It's the press.

946
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Of course they can.

947
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
This is the press is having the game.

948
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Remember, Heather?

949
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah, but if there's nothing going on there,

950
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
and they're not angry with each other.

951
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And they can do anything depressed, you know?

952
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Well, first of all, they're in a divorce.

953
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So they're not happy with each other.

954
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
There's just no two ways.

955
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I don't care who's breaking up for what reason.

956
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Yeah.

957
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
That's just a fact.

958
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
So you're never going to get someone smiling.

959
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Oh, I'm so happy because they're just not.

960
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Okay.

961
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Sometimes who's ever so happy.

962
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
You want to do it.

963
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
No.

964
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Give me one example.

965
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Thank you.

966
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
You don't have one.

967
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Very, very quiet.

968
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Dude, do I have to go get the fucking magazines about that?

969
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
No.

970
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Do you want me to get the magazines?

971
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I don't have them, but it sounds good threatening that.

972
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Well, because you were there.

973
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Well, of course.

974
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
No, no, no.

975
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You made it worse.

976
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
There you go.

977
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
That's where all the problems started.

978
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
20 years ago, I was there.

979
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Yeah, but the divorce went very quickly.

980
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Very good.

981
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Yeah.

982
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Nobody wanted anything.

983
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And Baba.

984
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Yeah, but you also didn't divorce a guy who's a billionaire.

985
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Okay.

986
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It doesn't matter.

987
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
That's not the same.

988
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
That's calm.

989
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
That happens.

990
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That's nothing.

991
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And by the way, Paul McCartney is like royalty.

992
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I know.

993
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Sir Paul is, you don't mess with Sir Paul.

994
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
We'll see.

995
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
So it is the press that is make.

996
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
This is what the press does, huh?

997
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Whether it's about you or me or poor.

998
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
But you know that Paul McCartney and Heather that a while ago, I was looking at them.

999
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And I said, this is not good.

1000
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
The two of them.

1001
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I know that.

1002
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
But not give me the update on where we at first.

1003
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Well, I don't know.

1004
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
She's asking a lot of money.

1005
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And well, actually, we don't know because it's all speculation, of course.

1006
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
What was the thing about her leg?

1007
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Her leg?

1008
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Oh, he was smacking her around.

1009
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
With her own leg?

1010
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Yeah.

1011
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
No, I don't know with her leg.

1012
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
That's what you told me.

1013
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I was a champion.

1014
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I was a champion.

1015
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I was a champion.

1016
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
He hid the leg.

1017
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I hid the leg.

1018
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
He hid her artificial limb.

1019
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Oh, really?

1020
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I'm not allowed to do that.

1021
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
That's fucking hilarious.

1022
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
That is very funny.

1023
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
No, but, you know, outside, if she has a...

1024
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Who knew?

1025
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
What am I going to do?

1026
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
What am I going to do?

1027
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Who didn't leg or not?

1028
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Yo, bitch.

1029
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
He found your goddamn leg.

1030
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
She...

1031
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Sugibane.

1032
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
She...

1033
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
He's just not.

1034
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And she doesn't look like a very nice person.

1035
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
You know?

1036
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And I've seen her couple of times.

1037
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I've seen interviews.

1038
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I've read interviews.

1039
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I still don't like it.

1040
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And you know what I think is the problem.

1041
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And where it begins, where it all begins.

1042
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Before you get to that, can I just say one thing?

1043
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
She may not come across as a nice person.

1044
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
But you really don't know her.

1045
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Let's not forget she did lose a leg.

1046
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I mean, and she did try to make something of herself.

1047
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
So I give her some props for that.

1048
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
You know, you lose...

1049
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
You lose like most people say fuck it.

1050
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm going to sit inside in my wheelchair all day and be unhappy.

1051
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And by the way, maybe she's still just a little bit unhappy about it.

1052
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Like getting fucking chopped off by a police motorcycle, no less?

1053
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Of course.

1054
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
But...

1055
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I get for a little bit of leeway there.

1056
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Just a little bit.

1057
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And we don't know about it.

1058
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I don't think it's an excuse for not being a very nice person.

1059
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Dude, you think I'm grumpy now?

1060
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Take off a fucking leg and then see how happy I am.

1061
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You'll be so happy.

1062
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So this is what I'm saying, you know?

1063
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
People are a little brave.

1064
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:59,000
But what I said to you is I think that the whole problem with the two of them...

1065
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
You put your left leg.

1066
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
You left leg.

1067
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
That's where it started.

1068
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
No.

1069
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
You know, that wasn't even a problem for Sir Poma Cardney.

1070
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Not at all.

1071
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
But what I think he's older.

1072
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Okay.

1073
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
You are older than I am.

1074
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You are now analyzing the problem between these two.

1075
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Yes.

1076
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
What is the age difference between Paul McCartney and Heather Mills?

1077
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I don't know.

1078
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
He is 64.

1079
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It's more than we have.

1080
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And she is what? 40?

1081
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Not even, I think.

1082
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Oh, come on.

1083
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
She's got it.

1084
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
She's got it.

1085
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
You have to look it up.

1086
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Google.

1087
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Hold on.

1088
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Google.

1089
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Can't spell it anymore.

1090
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
No.

1091
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Sir Paul McCartney.

1092
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Yeah.

1093
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Keep calling.

1094
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's like royalty.

1095
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Exactly what you're saying.

1096
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You know.

1097
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
1968, dude.

1098
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
She's younger than I am.

1099
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
She's 38.

1100
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Exactly.

1101
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
38.

1102
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Yeah.

1103
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Shit.

1104
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
That's a big difference.

1105
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It's like 28 years.

1106
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
But listen.

1107
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So before you start, I think people like Paul McCartney.

1108
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
They have a whole history.

1109
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I think he's very important.

1110
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,000
He was a very important person, especially in a music history.

1111
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Everything started with the Beatles.

1112
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Everybody in the whole world is still copying the Beatles.

1113
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
All the new groups are still copying.

1114
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
You can hear something.

1115
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
The Beatles in everything.

1116
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
It was so important.

1117
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I think that somebody like Heather is absolutely not interested.

1118
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Doesn't understand it.

1119
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Although he's maybe not talking about it.

1120
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
He's not, I think he's not a person that keeps on talking about the Beatles.

1121
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
He looks ahead.

1122
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
But still having that.

1123
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
He's a stone or dude.

1124
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
He's sitting there all day going.

1125
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Yeah.

1126
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
He knows a lot about music.

1127
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
His life is music.

1128
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Every memory is music for him.

1129
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
She doesn't understand it.

1130
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And that's where the problem also starts.

1131
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
What you're saying is, whereas it is his life.

1132
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Yeah.

1133
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And if you have a part the next to you that has nothing.

1134
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Nothing.

1135
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I guess he kind of, because I still, I caught the Beatles at the very tail end where they had the blue album and the red album.

1136
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Remember the collectors albums, like compilation albums.

1137
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And I played those over and over and over again.

1138
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Yeah.

1139
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
But I'm four years older.

1140
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And right after that came disco.

1141
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
That's, you know, I remember having my Beatles,

1142
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Blue, double album and red, double album.

1143
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
And on top of that was Greece.

1144
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Yeah.

1145
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And on top.

1146
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And then the inside of the night fever.

1147
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And then after that I was, I don't think she witnessed.

1148
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I don't think she did.

1149
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
No.

1150
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I don't think it's really an age thing.

1151
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I think she just doesn't give a shit about music.

1152
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
No.

1153
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
She doesn't give a shit about that.

1154
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
It was a bad match.

1155
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
The only thing that she thinks of is, oh, thank God.

1156
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
He's born with God.

1157
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
That's why he can help me.

1158
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I can see that.

1159
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Well, that's me.

1160
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
You don't know that.

1161
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I agree with what.

1162
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I heard that in something I saw on TV.

1163
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You should write it.

1164
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It looks at his face.

1165
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And I thought that is wrong.

1166
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
You should write for the son.

1167
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
You'd be a great corner.

1168
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
If I look at myself.

1169
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I absolutely can't compare myself to Paul McCartney.

1170
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
But I am from a musical family.

1171
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
My, my dad is a musician.

1172
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Everything was music.

1173
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Now I say, I'm medium.

1174
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
You the only thing you know is Google.

1175
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And sitting on your ass and looking at your laptop.

1176
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Excuse me.

1177
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
The thing of me.

1178
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
You think of Google.

1179
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Sitting on my ass?

1180
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
No.

1181
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
That's what I'm saying.

1182
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
What if you were just somebody who was always busy with, you know,

1183
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Internet.

1184
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I am not God.

1185
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You don't know anything about music.

1186
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
You don't know about the history of music.

1187
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
You don't know where it's coming from.

1188
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
You don't know shit.

1189
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
So every time I say something, he's like,

1190
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I don't know.

1191
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I've never listened to it.

1192
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I would be a very unhappy person.

1193
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I wouldn't marry you.

1194
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And here I was.

1195
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I would not have married you.

1196
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
This time thinking was about my cock.

1197
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Here's some guys who are influenced by the Beatles.

1198
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Yeah, it is the band.

1199
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
You know who these guys are?

1200
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
One of your daughter's favorites.

1201
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Who is it?

1202
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Come on.

1203
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
They just joined the podcast music network.

1204
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I don't have a name, but I know.

1205
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
My chemical romance.

1206
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Yeah.

1207
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Yeah.

1208
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Yeah.

1209
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Yeah.

1210
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Yeah.

1211
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Yeah.

1212
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Yeah.

1213
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Yeah.

1214
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Yeah.

1215
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Yeah.

1216
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Yeah.

1217
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Yeah.

1218
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Yeah.

1219
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Yeah.

1220
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Yeah.

1221
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Yeah.

1222
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Yeah.

1223
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Yeah.

1224
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Yeah.

1225
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Yeah.

1226
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Yeah.

1227
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Yeah.

1228
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Yeah.

1229
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Yeah.

1230
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Yeah.

1231
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Yeah.

1232
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Yeah.

1233
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Yeah.

1234
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Yeah.

1235
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Yeah.

1236
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Yeah.

1237
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Yeah.

1238
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yeah.

1239
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Yeah.

1240
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Yeah.

1241
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Yeah.

1242
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Yeah.

1243
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Yeah.

1244
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Yeah.

1245
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Yeah.

1246
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Yeah.

1247
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Yeah.

1248
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Yeah.

1249
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Yeah.

1250
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Yeah.

1251
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Ah.

1252
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Yeah.

1253
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Yeah.

1254
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Don't.

1255
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Yeah.

1256
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Yeah.

1257
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Yeah.

1258
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Yeah.

1259
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1260
00:38:46,000 --> 00:39:16,000

1261
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1262
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I'm like that, that's not the end

1263
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Never, never, never

1264
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Never, never, never, never

1265
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Never, never, never

1266
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Never, never, never, never, never

1267
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never

Never, never, ever, never, never, never, never really

1269
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Never, never, never, never, never, ever

1270
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:57,440
The new musical sensation known as chemical Michael Roman's from New Jersey and they just put this song up on the pot set of music that work

1271
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,580
I do think that's pretty cool. Well, we did some exercise on it. That was nice. Yeah, I saw it on my butt in front of the Google

1272
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:12,580
I heard you bought it. Okay, bitch. What else from? Well, I read that

1273
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:20,580
Brittany looks really good. She was getting divorced. They've let him in show for two seconds.

1274
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:28,580
Yeah, for two seconds. She just stopped. I saw it on YouTube. Yeah, I think she woke up now. Yeah. She finally got it. Dude, how about all those videos of you on YouTube?

1275
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:35,580
What was that? That's pretty cool. Yeah, that's you know, and this is what I like about YouTube is all that

1276
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:43,580
You know, all the the television stuff that you can't find anymore. Yeah, there's just no way to go and get it back. That's fantastic

1277
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:47,580
Yeah, it really is because it's some good stuff and a lot of your video clips are up there and

1278
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:56,580
Yeah, even a producer I think who did one of the we had a sort of a top of the pops in Holland and he produced it and we've been there many many times

1279
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:01,580
And he put the mom the you think he did that. Yeah, I think he did it totally it's sort of a strange name

1280
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:07,580
But I recognize totally legal, but yeah, you don't care. I don't care. I don't care at all

1281
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:13,580
Yeah, then why do other people care? I don't know. Thank you. I don't know why it's wonderful

1282
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:21,580
I think I think that it's wonderful. Yes, since those videos that know to do it, you know since those videos been up I get emails saying hey, I'm

1283
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:30,580
You know sometimes we don't know what to answer because I don't know where they are. I don't know now we know there's like one song on iTunes

1284
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:37,580
I think wonderful. I think well you should call your record company tell them didn't to EMI release a box set of your older work

1285
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:46,580
Yes, they did. Yeah, but my last record company wanted to release a DVD. Yeah, I think they're they're all in trouble

1286
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,580
They're not they're not doing it. I don't know now. They're all in trouble

1287
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:54,580
They they have no money to spend anymore. No, that's the business is gone. It's just it's you know

1288
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:59,580
Remember we used to have guys who would ride horse carriages and with horses and that they had no cabs

1289
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:04,580
No, where are those guys? Yeah, they're gone. You know sometimes things just have to go

1290
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:11,580
Yeah, gross restores and supermarkets. Yeah, that's sort of things. Yeah, that's that's a shame actually

1291
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:16,580
Anyway, Brittany. Yeah, Brittany. So I think she finally woke up

1292
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,580
That Kevin Fettaline was feeding her hamburgers

1293
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,580
So that she was really looking

1294
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:26,580
A shitty as possible and as fast as we really think that guy was doing that on purpose

1295
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:30,580
I don't know, but if you are Brittany Spears husband

1296
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:34,580
You have to be a little bit responsible say darling don't do that

1297
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:40,580
It's a pity because you've got a talent. You have to come back and you have to look but he probably didn't do that because he saw it

1298
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:43,580
If you hamburger and all the money's going to be mad

1299
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,580
You're just making that shit out

1300
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,580
You don't know that's horrible

1301
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:51,580
That's that's what that's what all the newspapers and entertainment tonight do

1302
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,580
No, but he looked like a loser

1303
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:57,580
Okay, agree with you there. That's that's what she's the worst. She gets the two kids

1304
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:01,580
Yeah, oh no, and he's asking now he's going to

1305
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:05,580
I know what he's going to try to get the kids. Oh, please

1306
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:08,580
Yeah, please. I don't I don't believe that for sure

1307
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,580
He's not going to get the money

1308
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,580
What the money?

1309
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,580
I heard money. He did if they married and he deserves money

1310
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,580
Well, he probably gets a little bit, but

1311
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,580
I think he should get a lot

1312
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:24,580
You know, I think if Heather Mills can get

1313
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,580
She's going to get 50 million pounds

1314
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,580
So about to preen up

1315
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:31,580
Yeah, but they didn't have it preen up and I don't think Brittany Spears and Kevin federal

1316
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,580
I never preen up

1317
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,580
You don't care

1318
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,580
You don't care

1319
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:35,580
I really just don't care

1320
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,580
No, we don't care about Brittany

1321
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:42,580
Well, but it was set to see her like that and it's what people feel

1322
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,580
And you know who's coming back

1323
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,580
We talked about this

1324
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,580
Whitney Houston

1325
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,580
Yes

1326
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,580
And guess who's producing her record

1327
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,580
So happy

1328
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,580
Guess who's producing her record

1329
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,580
No, I do

1330
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:55,580
Quincy Jones

1331
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:56,580
Oh, that's good

1332
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,580
There you go. And so Quincy

1333
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,580
If Quincy Jones is producing the record

1334
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:04,580
Then this could she could really do it. She can stay off the drugs

1335
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,580
She'll I think she could make a huge huge comeback

1336
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,580
Absolutely

1337
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,580
Exactly what I said get rid of Bobby Brown

1338
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,580
You know, do a killer record

1339
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,580
Oh, everybody said that

1340
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,580
Everybody said that

1341
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,580
Yeah, but I want to take credit for it. It was my idea

1342
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:21,580
And on you're going to say maybe Bobby Brown is a very nice guy

1343
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,580
Because you always do that

1344
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:24,580
No, he's an asshole

1345
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,580
Oh, he is

1346
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:26,580
But I knew that from day one

1347
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:27,580
This one is free

1348
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,580
I've told you the story about Bobby Brown

1349
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:30,580
I knew he was an asshole because I've met him

1350
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:31,580
So I think I have an unproper and thought

1351
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,580
He had an attitude problem

1352
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,580
That's what you see

1353
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,580
I met him

1354
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,580
Backstage

1355
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,580
Remember the Z100 jingle ball

1356
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,580
Remember you see the metal ends

1357
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,580
Be concert and we have a whole bunch of artists

1358
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,580
This is graphic and nasty

1359
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,580
What I'm going to tell you

1360
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,580
But Whitney Houston was there

1361
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,580
I mean, this is in the days of

1362
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,580
You know, I want to dance with somebody

1363
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,580
So this is actually just

1364
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:54,580
88

1365
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,580
Yeah, yeah

1366
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,580
It's around

1367
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,580
80 days

1368
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,580
Well, he was doing more than that

1369
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,580
Because he ran out of a dressing room

1370
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:03,580
Saying everyone

1371
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,580
Him and Emma just fuck Whitney smell my fingers

1372
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,580
Oh

1373
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,580
And I thought you aren't asshole

1374
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,580
Good

1375
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,580
So I hate that

1376
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,580
Right

1377
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,580
So you see I have an unproper authority

1378
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,580
That he's an asshole

1379
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:16,580
I didn't defend him

1380
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:17,580
Okay

1381
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,580
Because I know him

1382
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,580
That's shocking

1383
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,580
Yeah

1384
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:21,580
Or at least I know him

1385
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:22,580
I know him enough

1386
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,580
From that one encounter

1387
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,580
Did you smell it?

1388
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,580
Well, of course

1389
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,580
Of course

1390
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,580
I said can I look that finger above

1391
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,580
I know you did

1392
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,580
Oh, I did not

1393
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,580
Do you really do

1394
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,580
Honestly not

1395
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,580
I don't know

1396
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,580
Yeah, it was like one of those guy things

1397
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,580
Where it's not actually

1398
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,580
You're not actually meant to smell the finger

1399
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:40,580
No

1400
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:41,580
It was just like so wrong

1401
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,580
Yeah

1402
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:43,580
So wrong

1403
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:46,580
And that's the woman he wanted to marry

1404
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:47,580
No, he was sitting

1405
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,580
He was really sitting there thinking of the money

1406
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,580
Believe me

1407
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,580
That's a guy who was really calculating it

1408
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,580
Do you think she has anything left

1409
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,580
Of a voice you mean

1410
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,580
Of anything she had

1411
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,580
Of a voice her money

1412
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,580
I don't know about the life

1413
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:03,580
I think she still has the house

1414
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,580
The big house in New Jersey

1415
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:08,580
You know no

1416
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:09,580
I mean you just don't know

1417
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,580
I don't care

1418
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,580
I do I do hope

1419
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,580
I mean

1420
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,580
I could hear her voice going

1421
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,580
It was just you know

1422
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,580
She couldn't go

1423
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,580
Yeah, you can destroy your voice

1424
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,580
With that shit

1425
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,580
I know

1426
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,580
But

1427
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,580
If Quincy Jones is producing

1428
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,580
Then he he wouldn't do it

1429
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:24,580
If he didn't think something was there

1430
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:25,580
He really wouldn't

1431
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,580
No, yeah, he's just he's such a pro

1432
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:29,580
Very happy

1433
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,580
Yeah, yeah, I think that's good

1434
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,580
Very happy for him

1435
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,580
That's good

1436
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,580
All right baby

1437
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,580
It's 47 minutes

1438
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:36,580
I think we should stop

1439
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:37,580
Yeah

1440
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:38,580
Okay

1441
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,580
Do you want it?

1442
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,580
Gossiping

1443
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,580
Gossiping

1444
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,580
Wanna accuse me of anything before we go

1445
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,580
