Delta Sierra Charlie, three, six, six.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I've been sitting here for so long.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I've got the music, but I just ain't got some.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Go, I feel so dead and safe.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I can't attend, but I can't find out where I am.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I need a memory from this commodity.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Somebody tell me if I'm fine.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I really want to shine.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I really want to shine.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't think I'm fine.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I saw this dream on the night, so I can shine.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This is a cold, lonely time.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I keep on making up reasons why I just can't find the rhyme.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, I know something's got to give.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Some found deep down inside of me.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's been dying just a little.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Without feeling on my skin.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
There ain't no way in hell I'm ever given in.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Because I really want to shine.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I really want to shine.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I think it's time to shine.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
If I could only turn on the fire when I shine.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm sick and tired of holding out on me all the time.

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm waiting for the day when I can't be the one to shine.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm waiting for the day when I can't be the one to shine.

32
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Because I really want to shine.

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I really want to shine.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm waiting for the day when I can't be the one to shine.

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But I really want to shine.

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If I could only turn on the fire when I shine.

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But I really want to shine.

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:36,320
We got thirty knots wins, gusting.

39
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,720
Wish it was shining.

40
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,500
Kevin Reeves from his brand new CD, it's about time.

41
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,420
On the Charlie, daily source code, 366 coming to you from Curry Cottage in the affluence

42
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:53,620
suburb of Surrey, it's Gilford and yesterday, Kevin Reeves sent me his new budget, album

43
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,620
CD.

44
00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:01,020
He sent it to me in a big zip file, wow, man, fantastic, really, really great stuff.

45
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,020
I don't know how much of this is going to be put up on the podcast, music network, but this whole

46
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:11,380
album is just fantastic and it's funny because he sent me this nice package and it has

47
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,260
a little thumbs data, but I don't know, can you just import this whole thing into iTunes and

48
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:21,380
will iTunes understand that it's an album and put the, I guess not, hold on, there's

49
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:28,380
liner notes in here, let's check it out, all the credits, okay, who else worked on this

50
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:38,660
slow, Sean Moremello, cool, my goodness, lots of cool people on this, Joe Bragg, Ian

51
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,300
Beard, you know what I'm missing, I'm missing lyrics, I, in fact, I miss, you know,

52
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,460
we've talked about that before, I miss just folding open that double album, you know,

53
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,100
and I'm just rub the seeds out and then, oh yes, beautiful, read the lyrics, read the

54
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,860
liner notes, it doesn't matter man, it's all good as CC would say, fantastic, music

55
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,660
going to play some more from that brand new album, a little bit later on in today's

56
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,260
source code, lots of great technology coming my way today, I'm feeling good, like really

57
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:10,660
good, first of all, I have to tell you that I'm getting up late this week and probably

58
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:15,740
through, I don't think Christina has to go back to school until Wednesday, so we're just

59
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:22,100
enjoying getting up around, I don't know, 930, we're still just a little bit messed up

60
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,700
from travel and even that one hour difference, even if you stay in a different country

61
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:30,420
in a different time zone for just just a day, it's, you can really, I should have kept

62
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:36,700
my sunglasses on as, as was suggested yesterday by Tom Scooting, I'm going to try that

63
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,700
out dude next time we go to San Francisco and the next time I believe we'll be somewhere

64
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,820
mid May or the third week of May, Patricia's going to go with me because there's a big

65
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:50,300
conference, actually there's two conferences we're going to, one I can't tell you about

66
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,300
because it's one to secrecy, but I think the 24th and the weekend of the 24th and 25th

67
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:02,340
of May, there's a cleaner, perkins CEO weekend, so all the CEOs and founders of companies

68
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:09,100
that they invested in get together and play golf, I guess, so it's a pebble beach, so

69
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,020
I'm pretty sure they're going to be playing golf, I don't think I will be, unless Patricia

70
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,060
and I get hooked up with the neighbors before then and are actually able to, you know,

71
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,580
to get around a couple of holes and not look too foolish, but that's going to be fun,

72
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,940
it's going to be a lot of fun, just the two of us in the sun, in the condo, hanging out.

73
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,580
So back to the technology, it's just, no, no, I'm going to hold off on a second, I'm

74
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,460
going to hold off on that for one moment. First, let's talk about the box, the best

75
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,060
of Charlie's, I wanted to thank everyone else who sent in best of Charlie's because

76
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,660
they were too many that were sent in to actually play in the amount of days that we

77
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,700
had, so we're saving them up and we'll definitely use them, should there be a future

78
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,180
date where, you know, sometimes right, I can't make a Monday work or something like that,

79
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,420
then I'll throw in a best of Charlie for sure and everyone who sent in a box will definitely

80
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,900
get some pod shows, swag, whatever t-shirts and crap we've got laying around, which isn't

81
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:07,140
a lot, but it's a thought that counts, right? And I was so convinced along with many other

82
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:11,740
people that it was PWFent and who had created that final best of Charlie number six,

83
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:19,140
the mystery mashup, but no, no, actually, how can we even be talking about PWFent without

84
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,140
having his jingle playing? I mean, come on, that's what this thing is made for, right?

85
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,540
Once again, he's going to set the record straight, he hit the sideline repairman.

86
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:54,540
Hey Adam, Uncle Jesse here, I am very flattered that you give me credit for being the

87
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:02,140
DSC mystery mashuper, but I've got to confess, it wasn't me. The actual creator of that

88
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:08,460
particular best of Charlie was afraid that it might be a little too mean towards the

89
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:15,340
pod father, so I kept that contributors identity a mystery. It would be wrong for me to

90
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:22,500
reveal the identity of the mystery mashuper. So as always, let's all get home safe and we'll

91
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:29,500
all meet back here real soon and talk about some more shit. So long, Adam, Uncle Jesse out.

92
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,900
All right, Uncle Jesse, go check the steel wheelie, make sure we still got some shine. Mark

93
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,700
Yosha, what a name cough and the Pacific Coast help players. That's responsible for that

94
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,780
mashup. I loved it. I really did. And Angie B heard the call. She's got something to say about

95
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,780
it all.

96
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:50,180
Why, no, Adam, I don't play the cello. Sorry to disappoint you. I used to play electric

97
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:55,340
guitar in a band though, so I'll try to find a picture to send you. Oh, hey, did you

98
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:00,820
happen to hear PW's latest perfect head? I did a little intro form and I think you'd

99
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:06,260
enjoy it. You should check it out. Say, if I send in regular, I'll tell you. I'll have

100
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,140
nothing to do with PW effect and then perfect head, Angie. I don't care what you've done

101
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:10,900
for him, okay?

102
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,500
It'll comments. Does that mean Jeff will make me seem song to? Hmm, what do you do?

103
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,940
Yeah, well, let's replay that. Hold on, let me just pull that back one second. And regular

104
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:25,380
audio comments, does that mean Jeff will make me a theme song to? Hmm, what do you do?

105
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:33,140
I don't know, Angie, but you're surely fishing. Jeff sent me a nice little note. He says

106
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:38,660
that indeed he's been hired by other people to create theme songs for him. So there you go.

107
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,940
More money flowing through podcasting, loving it, completely loving it. So Angie, there's

108
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,740
a surefire way to get something done is to contract Jeff. And otherwise you are completely

109
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:59,660
at his mercy. Such as I'm often at the mercy of this man, comic strip, comic strip, comic

110
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:10,220
strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip. Happy Easter, Adam Curry. 2006 we have, and it is a bit

111
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:18,260
hilarious. Happy Easter, all of us, of the SC, and with nights to NGP. Bad flu, spoiled

112
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:26,420
Easter eggs. And fronches till he valor, frog legs. Nukura weapons achieved Iran, of which

113
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:34,540
USA is not a big fan. The future looks scary. So we have here Adam Curry. At least

114
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:41,540
this little fucker, Easter bunny. He's copying with his eggs and his funny, fuckier,

115
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:51,540
a piece, Easter bunny. It's still funny. Wow, comic strip blogger. The poetic version.

116
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:58,420
Excellent. I just don't know what to say, CSB. You could really hook comic strip blogger

117
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:04,780
up by getting him a great domain name to point to his website, comic strip blog.com. You

118
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:11,780
can get that a go daddy. And I'll cost you $6.95. I think he uses code DSC3. There's three

119
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:18,780
different options you can use. DSC1, DSC2, DSA3. And that'll get you a discount in any case.

120
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,620
Maybe you register something cool and point that to CSB site. He's back though, isn't

121
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,340
my goodness. Okay, technology time. Let's talk about some cool stuff. First of all,

122
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:33,780
I found a link yesterday to something called humanclock.com. If you haven't seen this,

123
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:39,140
go to if you're in front of a screen right now, punch it up humanclock.com. What a great

124
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:47,340
idea. The concept is it's a community-based project where anyone can submit pictures of hours

125
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:53,100
and minutes of the day. So I haven't actually done the math, but you need to 24 and then

126
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,540
time 60, I guess. Okay, that just broke my brain. Can't figure that one out. But they have enough

127
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,780
of them so that when you pull this clock up, and it's basically a meta refresh. So the browser

128
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:10,060
just refreshes. It shows all different versions of the time. So if I look over now, I see a, I see

129
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,660
that it's 130 pm here in the condo. And the picture I'm seeing is from San Francisco, California.

130
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,420
A picture of a road with yellow letters that says speed bumps. And there's a little sign that

131
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:27,980
says one colon 30 and there's people walking by. And so now, and you actually see a little timeline

132
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,300
underneath, which represents the seconds. And so in one more second, it's going to refresh to

133
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:42,540
131. Let's see what the picture is now. Oh, cool. 131. It's kids building blocks where 131 is spelled out.

134
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:48,940
And that's from St. Claude, Minnesota. It's great. And I can already see a million different

135
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:54,380
widgets. I mean, I shoot. I would actually buy an alarm clock if if it had that built into it,

136
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:59,020
there would be so awesome. Check it out, humanclock.com. It's just another one of those awesome

137
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:04,780
ideas that we're putting together as we have the tools and the infrastructure available and

138
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:10,780
on all these cameras out there and just creative minds and creative ideas fantastic. So that was part

139
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:17,500
one of the technology happiness that met me today as I surf through Gmail part two was

140
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:23,260
that cast blasters now connected to the podcast delivery network. It's fucking this is so awesome.

141
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,020
Now, of course, this is all still in the close beta. So you can't actually see any of this

142
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:34,300
working yet, but you've been seeing the actual files working for quite a whole second. Is that

143
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,060
a bitch that's the satellite repairman saying where the hell is the show? Let me see.

144
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:47,020
No, cool. Okay, I'm going to tell you what that is in the second, too. Oh, there's three pieces

145
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:53,580
of technology to talk about today. So now with cast blaster, you enter your podshow podcast delivery

146
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:58,060
network credentials and then immediately recognizes that you have, in fact, I have two shows in

147
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,220
there. One is the upload for the daily source code. Another one is for something I call Charlie

148
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,860
Chat, which I'm really just using is a kind of a testing bed right now. So it scans your count.

149
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,780
It knows how many shows you have. You can select which show. And then all you do is just fill out

150
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,060
the stuff you were filling out anywhere. Your show notes, which, of course, are baked into the

151
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:19,340
MP3 file when you save it, when you save the file. And of course, you can still save it locally,

152
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:24,780
which is recommended. But then you hit upload and show notes, descriptions, everything's all shot

153
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:30,780
off to the pdn. The MP3 file is uploaded. Nice little status bar there. And you're done. That's it.

154
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:36,220
And even that, just a one small step, it makes such a difference in the production because

155
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,060
you know, it's like you used to have to, okay, save it. And then you'd upload it and then you'd have

156
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:47,980
to enter your show notes and copy paste. And it's going to save me at least 20 minutes if not more

157
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:53,660
on a daily basis. I'm so happy. Thank you, Mike. Thank you Andrew. Thank you Chris Rockwell.

158
00:15:53,660 --> 00:16:00,060
Guys, great freaking job. Great job. And then the last piece of technology that just bug me

159
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:07,900
out today. I love it. It's Google Calendar. Last night, I received an email with a login

160
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,820
to Google Calendar. I think this came through Steve Gilmore. I'm not quite sure how it was Google

161
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:19,900
gesture is very, I have no idea how he got into the loop on this, but I really don't care because

162
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:26,860
this is what I've been waiting for. Almost as completed, Mike, my, my, my, already undying love

163
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:33,500
for what these guys are doing with email. Now to connect calendars into Google is just phenomenal.

164
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,740
It's, you know, of course, it's all Ajax. So, you know, there's no refreshing of pages.

165
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:44,540
Stuff just gets popped in. It understands natural language so you can say lunch tomorrow with Patricia

166
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,500
and it'll automatically, you know, know that that'll be noon tomorrow, or you could say at 3 p.m.

167
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,580
or you could say on Saturday or next week, you know, so it has some of that natural language

168
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:59,980
understanding of just want to enter something really quick. It can import your iCal calendars.

169
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:07,900
Also, anything with the iCal format. So, outlook and also apples, iCal, it understands that.

170
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:15,020
It can also do CSV files. It can export so that you can actually subscribe to it in other calendars.

171
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:20,780
I mean, it's, they did it right. Everything that is there. Excuse me, Sensei, which I am

172
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:29,820
consuming, as we speak. And it'll also notify you of events through text message to your phone.

173
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,780
And that's what just came through Google Calendar SMS verification. Please enter and then

174
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:39,420
there's a code as the verification code in the, okay, it didn't finish the whole message there.

175
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,300
So, one of what that's about. I was waiting for that to come in. I, I had already told it to

176
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,980
configure it last night. I guess that's, well, of course, it's bait and it's still busy. But so,

177
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,820
you know, now, whenever there's something going on, immediately, it'll send a message to my phone.

178
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,420
I hope at least it'll send it in the timely fashion. I'll test that out in the next couple of days.

179
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:04,300
And the only thing I need now is a mobile version of it. I've given you a mobile version and guys,

180
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:11,660
I would pay for this. And I'll just say one more time, please, please Google, please, let me buy more space.

181
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:18,300
I need more space. The idea is so, look, you can index my shit, you can search it,

182
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,780
you can give it to the, to the authorities. I have nothing to hide, but please give me more space.

183
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,020
So, I can port more shit on there. I'd really, really would appreciate it.

184
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:34,460
Technology, loving it today. I'm going to play a song for you, which I, I found in, but it was,

185
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:39,260
I think the most played yesterday on the podcast music network. And the reason I'm playing

186
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,580
is because during vacation, although we were completely, I was certainly very relaxed,

187
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,900
really unwind, pretty much unplugged from the net, except for some blackberry stuff. But,

188
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,980
you know, what can you do, right? That's what it's for to kind of sneak a peak once in a while.

189
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,060
But there was also really no mail coming in to speak of, because people kind of left me alone,

190
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:02,380
which is highly appreciated. But we were, you know, watching a movie, I'm trying to think

191
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:07,260
what the name of this movie would. I think we just can't like the tail end of it. And it

192
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:14,540
involved a scene where a father mother and daughter are being attacked by this crazy couple.

193
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,940
And they're being attacked in their house, and they've tied them up, and they've set them on fire,

194
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,580
and they break loose. And then, so, you know, so there, this crazy couple is trying to get the,

195
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,100
the kid, gosh, I wish I could remember the name of that movie. Christine has gone otherwise,

196
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,980
it asked her. She, she would know immediately. And then the, the husband

197
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:39,820
um, creeps up behind the mail of this, of this crazy couple, and waxing with a two by four.

198
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:45,820
And at that very moment, I said, oh, man. Oh, that would, that just, it almost felt good.

199
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:50,700
Which, of course, was kind of frightening, because what happened is I saw, it was,

200
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,420
so played so well. And the cinematography was done so perfectly. It was very, and we're talking,

201
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,220
like, half a second worth of, of film, really. But it just gave me, I was like, wow,

202
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:05,180
I would really like to just wax someone with a two by four. I really, it's in me,

203
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,060
which is kind of scary. And it was just, it's aggression that was like coming out and just,

204
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:14,780
on the verge, and Patricia Christina said, what do you mean? I said, well, there's just a couple

205
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,020
people that I would really like just to whack with, with a, with a piece of wood that would,

206
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:25,420
I, it would make me feel so good. Now, of course, I, I don't really intend on doing that,

207
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:32,220
but it did spur me on to, to actually play this song, which might help get some of it out of my

208
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:37,260
system. Matt Sumo, guys. So many ways to kill you.

209
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:22,140
I could be with switchblade, or I could use them shedding that, just break out the Terminator.

210
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,820
I can't catch up to you, yeah, I can't give you the rest of the course, just jamming me in your head.

211
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:34,140
Or I can wax you with the Oasis cheese, so I've covered in red. It's about to lead one more time.

212
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:39,980
If you want to be a long time, then anything, you're so mad. There's so many ways I can kill you.

213
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,420
Shut up, you shit, you're sitting in your left, because I don't want to hear you.

214
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:49,420
But if you don't just run out of love, there's so many ways I can kill you.

215
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:59,660
Yeah, well, I can clear you with a toy in your head, or I'll keep you with a sound.

216
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,700
Probably not the Hyundai, but I can still pick it up.

217
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,340
I can clear where they hit you run, or you're visually in country drive.

218
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,340
Run your down, and score it up. Your ass stuck under my four-wheel drive.

219
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:17,340
It's never gonna be one more time. If you want to feel the want to, then anything, you're so mad.

220
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:21,180
But there's so many ways I can kill you. Shut up, you shit, you're sitting in your left,

221
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,420
because I don't want to hear you run.

222
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,820
You don't just run out of love, and there's so many ways I can kill you.

223
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,700
That's the break, y'all.

224
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,700
Well, death, and destruction, score another hit on the wall.

225
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,020
When the jacks attacks the stacks, wax with an axe to print the backs of the black jack axe.

226
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,620
So many ways I can kill you.

227
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,700
So many ways you can die.

228
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,700
So many ways I'm gonna get you.

229
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,020
So let's just rip it up one more time.

230
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,420
Burn it up.

231
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,380
I'ma suck on it.

232
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,380
Shoot some manslaughter, shoot you stabbing.

233
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,580
Keep it to the assassination floor.

234
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,380
I'm gonna miss a girl, but I'm gonna strike the lynching to kill you.

235
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,020
Take this layer, and hit me, and wipe down with a mask.

236
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,780
Fix the ears, and some fucking speck.

237
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,980
Boys and excuses.

238
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,780
Just to do pop off, wax, but just get jess.

239
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,540
One more time, if you wanna feel the one, two, one.

240
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,380
Bad attitude, think you're so bad.

241
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,380
But there's so many ways I can kill you.

242
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,420
Shit, I'm a shit.

243
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,420
It's a little bit cause I don't wanna hit you.

244
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,980
And I, if you don't just run out of love,

245
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,940
yes, many ways I can kill you.

246
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,460
Mad sumo, from CC's neck of the roads, Massachusetts.

247
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,660
From his buy on the pod save music network.

248
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,980
When he's not drinking and womanizing, mad sumo,

249
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,580
delves into the rock blues and electronic genres

250
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,820
to deliver brilliant music you can dance to.

251
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,780
His music has been played in many podcasts and indie movies

252
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,020
across North America and now the world.

253
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,180
Oh, thanks to the pod's hit music network, very cool.

254
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,900
All right, of course, links to that in the show notes.

255
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,580
For those of you checking us out on serious satellite 102.

256
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,940
Today, right after this show, which is ending in just mere seconds,

257
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,740
we'll bring you Pacific Coast hell away,

258
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,460
followed by East Radio Don and Drew Gilmore Daily.

259
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,180
And if all goes according to plan a new digital flauntsum

260
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,140
from my very own Uncle Jesse side-light repair man,

261
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:21,180
PW Fenton, followed up by Michael Butler with the rock and roll.

262
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,780
I don't know if he does the rock and roll geek show tonight.

263
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,740
If he does the indie cast,

264
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,900
he does something just for the serious listeners, not too sure.

265
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,580
So that's what's coming up, and of course,

266
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,740
I'll be back here tomorrow to bring you the thank god

267
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,180
it's Friday edition of The Daily Source Code

268
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,900
on the serious stars 102.

269
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:42,060
We're by the way at the New York Auto Show this week with playboy bunnies.

270
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,460
Now see, there's a drawback to all that podcasting stuff.

271
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,140
Okay, they're gone. Just you and me now.

272
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,540
Tired of the FCC filling your head with tired-born,

273
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,300
fluently correct radio,

274
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,220
centered in the language of your host's,

275
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,740
and limiting what he can listen to,

276
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,220
try the unradio show.

277
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:09,100
We are un-centered, unpopular, and a lucky life just like you.

278
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,140
After all, you didn't move out of your mom's basement to listen to

279
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,980
popular radio, did you?

280
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,020
Hell no, stick it to the man in the FCC.

281
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,380
Listen to us.

282
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,180
It's really, what else have you got going for it?

283
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,020
I don't know if it's a David Graham door sitting in the window.

284
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,380
I'm looking for a work placement of a minimum of 40 weeks in a software development role

285
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,900
in the South of England, and I thought your listeners could help me out.

286
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,300
I'm studying the peating at Bournemouth University,

287
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,380
and one of the requirements of the third year

288
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,380
is to take a year's work placement.

289
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,620
I have an experience in a number of programming languages such as

290
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:52,540
C, Java, PHP, P, P, B, Oracle, SQL, and many more.

291
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:57,500
And I'm also familiar with software such as Windows 2000 Server, Linux,

292
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:03,020
Slawless Unix, Dreamweaver, and a David Photoshop.

293
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,940
If you are a listener, and your company has never employed a work placement student,

294
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,580
the main benefits are that we are cheap labour, as our students are used to being poor.

295
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:16,060
I want to start any time between July and September 2006,

296
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:26,620
and you can contact me at this RayCatch email address, d1169254 at Bournemouth.ac.uk

297
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,740
That's about B, O, U, R, and E, Mouth.

298
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,380
And I can send you a CV.

299
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,260
Thanks, Adam. Let's see if podcasting recruitment works.

300
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,140
Good bye.

301
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,620
Let's certainly work for us with some of our jobcasts.

302
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,660
And it's interesting because Christina said the other day said,

303
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,580
Dad, I also have to do a work placement.

304
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,620
Just to do it, I think in September or October,

305
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,860
which is what we in the States would call an internship,

306
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:52,140
and I'd say, well, once you come out to San Francisco for a week,

307
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,140
and being an intern at Pod Show.

308
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,540
And apparently, that's not allowed, or I'm not quite sure what the deal is.

309
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,540
So she's looking for something locally, and I said,

310
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,900
well, I really don't know anyone.

311
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,780
And the people who I do know, honestly, Christina, I don't know if I would want to recommend you,

312
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,180
because damn, you can be pretty lazy.

313
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,340
She's just, no, no, no, not for other people, only at home.

314
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,060
Is this a teenager talking or what?

315
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:20,460
So if you have any thoughts for work in my, my daughter, pretty hard,

316
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:26,300
I would definitely support it if you've got a gig for her somewhere in October,

317
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,580
also a word, and no pay necessary, obviously.

318
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,500
Well, you can give her a couple of shilings if you want to.

319
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,100
Well, I was going to say something else about that.

320
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,780
Oh, wait a minute.

321
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:45,980
Ooh, I just got, okay, Google tests notification starting at 1,400.

322
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,860
Yeah, so I just, while the, while the song was playing,

323
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:57,500
so many ways to kill you, I verified my email, I verified my email address,

324
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,220
or I verified my text number for the Google calendar notifications.

325
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,060
So it just popped up in the browser, which I've configured that way.

326
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,500
So what should happen next?

327
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,060
Wait a minute, that should probably happen in three more minutes,

328
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:19,260
because the official time is 142, I guess my blackberry off or my, one of the two is off.

329
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,220
Okay, so we'll see if that comes in, I'll just put the blackberry down there for a second.

330
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,740
Oh, I remember what I was going to say, lots of feedback, lots.

331
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:32,940
I mean, I must have received at least eight or nine different emails from UK podcast

332
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:38,060
or saying, yo dude, if you guys are coming, I'm going to do some pints and darts, count me in.

333
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:47,580
So I immediately shot off some email to Rosie at to HQ and she's going to set it up and get

334
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,860
it on a calendar. It's not going to be a big extravagant thing. I think we're just going to find a pub

335
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:55,740
somewhere where we can all just hang out and, hey, how about the old Vic? Maybe the old Vic is

336
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,220
available. I hope we can just crash out in the corner and just hang out and talk for a little bit,

337
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:06,540
but won't really have time for much else, but at least we can share some, some thoughts ideas

338
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:12,620
and some beers. I think that'll be just about perfect. Okay, I got, what is it?

339
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,420
Another two minutes. Okay, I'm going to play another piece of audio feedback from Shmey and then we'll see if

340
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,420
the Google notification came in on time.

341
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:33,660
Hey Adam, this is Shmey again from thenaudcast.com. I'm a 14 year old podcaster living in Oregon.

342
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:39,740
I've been loving podcasting so far. I sent me four audio comments recently. You played the

343
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:45,420
first one. Thank you so very, very much. I just wanted to call in. First of all, I couldn't

344
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,300
give a crap play this on the show. I really, really do want you to hear it though. So

345
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:58,860
this isn't a plea. I just being homeschooled. I have a decent amount of extra time on my hands,

346
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:05,980
more than a normal kid would, and I am honestly willing to put that time to our podcast.

347
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,700
Yeah, I already am, but I think the stuff that you guys are doing at Pod Show is so innovative and

348
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:16,780
so amazing. I'd really love to become a part of it. I'm also a musician. This is my music

349
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:23,740
playing. I have some stuff up on the PMN under Shmey, and I would, I would just love to help out.

350
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,340
So if there's anything I can do, if I could join the Pod Show family,

351
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:32,540
a little prematurely and help out with tests and all that great stuff, I'd really love to.

352
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:38,700
So please reply to this. Tell them what you think. And so far as I know, you don't have any

353
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,260
teen podcasts in the family. Do you love to be the first one? All right, Adam, hope you're having

354
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:48,780
a great time and Portugal. You can find mine at my podcast, TheNodcast.com. I continue to love

355
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:53,420
the Charlie, and I'll see you later. Bye. Yo, Shmey, the interesting thing you said that you're

356
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:58,460
homeschooled. I'd love to hear more about that. And sure, we can definitely talk about

357
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:03,900
about the U.S. team podcaster on the network. We've actually talked to a couple of them,

358
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:10,060
but it's kind of tough because we really need to have your parents consent. And so we need to

359
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:16,460
actually talk to them on the phone and make sure everything's cool. We've had some cases where

360
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:24,060
it was suggested. Well, you know what, one just call my mom on Skype. Yeah, here's our Skype

361
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:28,700
name. Yeah, right. Like we're really going to talk to your mom or your dad. But Shmey,

362
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:36,060
yeah, send me an email and I'll pass it on to Richard Brewer. Hey, and let me know about

363
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:40,300
that homeschooling stuff. I'm very interested in how long have you been homeschooled, how old are

364
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:45,900
you, how does it work, and how much time are you allowed to do podcasting every single day?

365
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:50,140
Just how do your parents manage that? Maybe we should get your mom on. Or is that

366
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:54,700
incredible? No, no, how have I made it incredibly lame all the sudden? I'm not suggesting that.

367
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:01,260
Maybe not such a good idea. Like very time now, 146. Okay, so this is not working the way I'd

368
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:07,020
expected it. So I should have received a notification from the Google Calendar by now. See,

369
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:11,180
this is the thing, you know, if you want to rely on this stuff, it's really, it's really got

370
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:17,740
I think I had the notification set to go 15 minutes before the actual event. So maybe the

371
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,660
text messages are sent on a different schedule, but we'll just keep that there. Well, it was at the

372
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:25,580
end of the show for today anyway, but one more interesting piece that came in. Adam, I hope you've

373
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:32,140
enjoyed your vacation. I've certainly enjoyed listening to the box sets that were available while

374
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:37,980
you were gone. Reason I'm talking to you today is I have been spending the last few hours

375
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:44,460
preparing the company I work for is television Emmy nominations that for our particular region are

376
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:50,700
doing a month here. Yes, I work for a large media conglomerate. But as I was going through the

377
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:56,300
National Academy of Television, Arts and Sciences webpage, I noticed that they had just released

378
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:03,660
the nominations for what they call first Emmy Award for internet cell phones and iPods.

379
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:12,380
So I quickly went and looked at the list of the nominees and they were filled with content produced

380
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:23,180
by Fox Mobile Entertainment, America Online MTV. Where's Tiki Bar TV? Where is Geek Brief TV? Did we

381
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:29,980
not know about these? Did you know they were giving Emmy's a way for iPod video? Or is this just

382
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:36,620
yet another way for big television, big media conglomerates to pat themselves on the back for how

383
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:43,100
well they have embraced podcasting and the iPod revolution? Well, that's a very good question.

384
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:49,820
I think that you have to be a member of the Academy to actually be recognized. And I'll look

385
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:54,300
that up. It may not be very hard to become a member of the Academy. There may be some dues,

386
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,300
but I think it's pretty much a club. And that's how it works with clubs. You have to be a

387
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:04,220
member to be considered. But if it's not too hard to join, I'm pretty sure next year we'll see some

388
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:11,260
some user-generated nominees. I sit in a about a weekly staff meeting here from our big company where

389
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:15,500
they're discussing how are we going to get on board with podcasting? How are we going to provide

390
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:23,340
our content to iPods in video? And I started a podcast about a year ago when my wife and I were

391
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:30,700
planning our wedding, called the Countdown to Chaos podcast, that I carried on for

392
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:35,740
approximately until you were married. Dude, I remember that one. We 25 or so episodes kind of through

393
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,980
our wedding planning. So I got to know a little bit about podcasting. Not nearly as much as you do

394
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:47,980
of course, but I sit in these meetings and even though we're a large corporation, we've got some good

395
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:52,940
content, I think, especially in the video realm. And I'm excited just to get the stuff out there.

396
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:57,260
I'm ready to go back to my desk and start ripping stuff and starting coding it and getting it

397
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:03,980
up on the internet for people to download. And just at the corporate level, it takes months and months

398
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:08,860
of research. And how can we do this? And what are the legalities of that? And can we show this out of

399
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:15,340
this market? And et cetera, et cetera. And so it's very frustrating to want to be in there and

400
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:20,540
kind of know what it's like to be at the ground level and just sort of be hamstrung by the fact

401
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:25,820
that I've got a big corporation. It's kind of driving the boat here. So very envious of you guys

402
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:31,980
out there at Pod Show. I think you're doing a great job and don't get yourself so big that it takes

403
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:37,180
meeting upon countless meeting and committee to vote on everything you want to do.

404
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,460
I keep it the great work. Thanks very much and I'll keep listening.

405
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:44,860
No, thank you very much. And when you think we're big enough, and hopefully not too big,

406
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:49,580
because I agree with you there. But that's not really, I mean, I'm sure that your company can do

407
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:55,980
stuff pretty quickly when it's in your own company's field of expertise. So it's just, you know,

408
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:01,420
fear uncertainty, doubt, stuff like that that always makes it tough. No one wants to get crushed

409
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:06,780
for making the wrong decision. And boy, our lot of decisions being made these days. I look at

410
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:12,300
Disney ABC. That's going to be pretty cool. I wonder if they're going to, if Disney ABC is going to

411
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:19,100
limit access the way it currently works in iTunes. And I have a US iTunes account. So I'm able to

412
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:23,100
download lost and pay for it, of course, and watch it. I caught up on two episodes just the other

413
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:28,460
day. But anyway, when you think we're ready for you, you know, ping me. It sounds like you got some

414
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:34,620
skills we could choose in our media company. Most excellent. Okay, looking at the human clock now,

415
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:42,780
I see 1553 degrees Fahrenheit, coolant temperature, which means it's 153. And now,

416
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:49,020
oh, that's interesting. Oh, this is the wrong one. Somehow they got the wrong one in there.

417
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:56,700
It says 134. That should be 154. Oops. They mislabeled a picture there from Canada. Oh, well.

418
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:02,860
And not always 100% fantastic here at the cottage. Yesterday I spoke to my mom. She had another

419
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:09,100
checkup yesterday. For those of you who've been listening to the Charlie for a while, you know that

420
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:17,100
she was diagnosed with lung cancer. Almost a year and a half ago and had one long removed. And

421
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:22,780
it has been doing quite fine and then a tumor popped up in her side and had that removed and it

422
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:29,420
came back and she's had chemo and she's had radiation. And she's really just trying to regain a lot of her

423
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:40,140
strength. And yesterday they did a test. I think it's an echo. I believe it is. And they saw some kind of

424
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:45,580
anomaly on her remaining lung. So that means there's going to be a new scan, which will be done

425
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:50,940
in two weeks time in the meantime to help her regain her strength even quicker. She's going to have

426
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:56,860
a blood transfusion tomorrow. She's in great spirits. I have to say she's she's fighting this all the

427
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:04,300
way. And she's promised me she's coming flying with me in a couple weeks. So that might be the

428
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:12,220
death of her. But she's great. And I wanted to play a song for her. One that is on Kevin Reeves

429
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:17,980
knew album and it just it was so fitting. I figured that yeah. And she has that great new bronze

430
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:23,420
top as she calls it with Wi-Fi. So while she's down stairs in the living room and she doesn't have to

431
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:28,620
walk upstairs to go check stuff out. I'll send her the link to the show so she can then hear the song

432
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:35,900
as well. Again from Kevin Reeves. It's his mother on the daily source code. I have been down.

433
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:57,180
Like my lives came in. And I can't seem to find the lives about. And I've lost my direction again.

434
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:12,140
And I'm feeling lonely at the end of the day. I know that my son is phone call the way.

435
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:26,860
Because it's here. Mother, it's my way. It's so when it's been sleeping and it's here.

436
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:43,500
Mother, take my broken heart in your safe. You. And I'll trip to wait. Nothing more can I say.

437
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:51,340
When I love you.

438
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:12,780
Here I go. Here I go. I am making a sound that came for me. But I know that I can take

439
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:27,500
my broken heart in your safe. You. And I'm feeling lonely at the end of the day.

440
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:33,500
Tell me the name. Don't kill up the fight.

441
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:50,060
Mother, it's my way. It's so when it's been sleeping and it's here.

442
00:40:50,060 --> 00:41:04,700
Mother, it's my broken heart in your safe. You. And I'll trip to wait. Nothing more can I say.

443
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:50,060
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

447
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:31,060
Do you see a nice creamy sauce over this because of this morning? Is this a reward?

448
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:39,060
Oh, this is a sort of yeah, and you're too skinny for my taste. Oh, you're too skinny for my taste.

449
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:44,060
That's for my feeding you. Really, thank you. That's a lot of energy.

450
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:49,060
And the presentation with nice little rugal assailant there.

451
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:53,060
The silver spoon silver fork, I'll put it right over here. Oops.

452
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:57,060
I already got some cocktail sauce on my mic cable.

453
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,060
Thank you, honey.

454
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,060
Okay.

455
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,060
We're done with the show anyway, sir. Yes, but messy.

456
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,060
Thanks, baby. Love you.

457
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,060
Oh, my life sucks, huh?

458
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:11,060
Okay. Tomorrow we'll do more. We'll do a thank God, it's Friday.

460
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:22,060
Manjana and portions of today's podcast were brought to you by Earthlink.

461
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,060
A little secret.

462
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:28,060
If you send email to adamaccurry.com, it goes through an Earthlink account.

463
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:31,060
It gets forward to an Earthlink account because I love their spam filter.

464
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:36,060
And then it gets forward to my Gmail account, who of course have another spam filter on top of that spam filter.

465
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,060
So it's getting better.

466
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:41,060
Maybe I should put one more in the chain and I'll really have everything I'm looking for.

467
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,060
And also portions brought to you by.
