Delta Sierra Charlie 382

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
My name is Sam, I live in South Florida and your headphones are backwards.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The elbows on the left side and maybe the elbows on the left side.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not a pilot, so all I can wish you is post-modern blow drives in a giant split.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm coming back

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
No, he ain't as bad as I am

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Just one

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
There's a door

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You name it my head

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So he hasn't been like a woman

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
No, he ain't as bad as I am

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Just one

There's a door

There's a door

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Start now if you're Monday just right

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Some different on the Charlie

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Jessica Smith Wright, tip from Steve Webb

50
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We actually told me to check out the English version over Commer

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But then I saw that Oliver songs are English and Spanish

52
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So I decided what the hell? Let's do a Spanish song

53
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Man, she's cute too, thanks Steve

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Hey everybody, it's Monday, time for a new week of the daily source code

55
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The weather outside today outside the cottage in Guilford

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Is exactly what we expected Saturday evening

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
On our way back from Rotterdam from visiting my mom

58
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We thought we were going to have a thunder storm

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It didn't warm up quite enough for that to take place

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The morning around

61
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I think Patricia said around five a.m. and so it's really wet today

62
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Lots of traffic and you know because of water

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Just because of water, but we needed it

64
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
We needed some water here because there's been someone

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
A water shortage and actually water coming out of the

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Out of the tap is quite expensive these days in the UK

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Sorry about the cowbell

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I just couldn't resist

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And Rob doesn't like it at all

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Adam has a long time listener just wanted to ask you a favor

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Please stop hitting the cowbell while songs are playing

72
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
From the song

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I like some good old cowbell as much as the next guy

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But if the artist wanted cowbell in their song

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
They would have put it in themselves

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Just a comment from a long time listener

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Thanks as Rob, yeah, I hear you Rob

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But you know, it's

79
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm not trying to take away from the song

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You can always go listen to the song

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And the positive music network is just it feels like

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I need some

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I got a fever, the only thing that will cure it is more cowbell

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I heard and it's pulled from the flesh into a podcast

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Just heard your shout out in try these DSC

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I've got a drumstick here if you want it

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I think to recall it being one of those end of geek thru out drumsticks

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You know when the drummers finish playing for the evening

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And he chucks all the drumsticks into the crowd

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I can't for the life of me remember who from

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But given that I was a bit of a headbang of back in the day

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
There's a good chance it was someone like Black Sabbath

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Or Mozart or someone like that

94
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But to be honest I was a bit of a stone and back then

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I remember it came from

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You know, it's true it really does square up your short term memory

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You know?

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You know, thanks Adam, thanks for attending DSC, it's good to hear

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You've got your cowbell from Mr Nicholson

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Hopefully another brick and give you your drumstick

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That's about it. Oh, one more thing

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, it really does square up your short term memory

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You've got to be careful about that, you know

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Cheers mate, take care

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Bye bye. Yeah, dude, thank you

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I was gonna say something but I forgot

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah, actually

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I told, so what was that Friday or so I said that

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You know the reason why I'm a little bit out of time is because I'm hitting the cowbell

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The podcast Paul gave to me gave me a hitting it with a pencil

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And I told Patricia that and she said, oh, no, no, hold on

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We have something and she went into Christine's room

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I love the I don't think the daughter knows yet

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And she got her wiser drumstick

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This is remember we went to the wiser show

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We were invited there by Dan from parking a bit of a square

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Bit of a square circle

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I've got it all wrong now

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, it's the short term memory again

120
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So it actually has the backstage pass wrapped around it

121
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But it's a great drumstick

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You can really really really whack it now

123
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So hopefully I'll do a little bit better

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Of course the person that really spurn me and spawn me, spurn me

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Then encouraged me to continue with the cowbell

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Was Beth Thorne Lee who's music I just loved a bit

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Of course Mr. Lovely is what we wound up last week with

128
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And that's sent in a comment and her comment really encapsulates part of what I love about pod safe music and about pod casting

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Back in the day when I was doing pirate radio in the early 80s late 70s early 80s

130
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You know you played a song because you knew that it would work

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It would probably work for your listeners

132
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Of course now it's even better because if it doesn't work for a listener you can just shuttle right through it fast forward

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But there was also a relationship

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You know we were building up relationships with artists and we were really supporting them because we liked the music

135
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
There was no other financial gain in the middle anywhere

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Now of course these days on the radio

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's very hard for a

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
A presenter or a disjockey to

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Really get behind a record because they have rotations and playlists

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And they're limited by time and that's how commercial radio works

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And back in the day we used to have some

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Well the relationship we build up with artists could be very special in 80

143
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm going to say 81 Madonna came through town through Amsterdam

144
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
This was when she was still she had she had joined up with jelly bean beneath us

145
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And so he had of course done I think it produced her record

146
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So that was the record with borderline holiday

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Lucky star

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You know it was the record and it wasn't till the second time it was released that it actually became a hit

149
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But she came to our decimal radio studios and did hash under glass with us and it was a good time

150
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That was about the extent of the relationship there with Madonna but Beth only understands

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That these relationships

152
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Between people who play the songs and

153
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Cherish the songs and share them with their audience and the creator of this art

154
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Well it can go a bit further

155
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Hey Adam this is Beth only

156
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And I think I'm going to have to come over there and kiss you full on the lips

157
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Thank you for playing my tunes

158
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And I'm digging the cowbell

159
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Thank you Beth

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Little cowbell for Beth

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I got to play you some of her slower tunes too

163
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But the rock and stuff I just totally totally dig

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Let's keep it with pod save music for a couple seconds here

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Because there's always something going on with the UK music scene

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
One of the folks I met at our draft and darts meet up

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Was it two three Sundays ago two Sundays ago now but three Sundays ago

168
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Was our buddy from Burbs

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What you're doing for our country is so cool

170
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Hey Adam Barry Burbs here from British underground rock bands

171
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm just stopping by to let you know about something quite new and exciting that I've started at Burbs with podcasting

172
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Essentially it's called gig casts and if you go to the gig cast in page at Burbs, Kuk, slash gig cast

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You'll find a list of subscriptions to gig lists in different areas of the UK

174
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So the idea is you subscribe to the gig cast of the area that you're in

175
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And every Saturday you'll receive an audio gig list which features snippets of the bands that are playing close to you

176
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So I thought that was quite a neat idea and I just wanted to tell the world about it

177
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And I thought well better way than through my good friend Adam Curry

178
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Keep up the good work mate cheers

179
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yo mate back at you keep it up

180
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Fantat is for you know the first two times I'll listen to that comment because I have to run through stuff

181
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Because it's not always very descriptive the way it shows up in in my outline or in cast blaster

182
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I thought he said gig cast but as gig cast and I think it is a great idea

183
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Particularly by region and there is such an incredible culture of gigging here in this country

184
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Of people playing anything they can they can literally play and I have talked to Christina once again

185
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And I said look you know I know you're into into sharing music

186
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Why don't we just do a show and she has everything else that up pod saved pod saved the queen

187
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I think that you know she said I don't know what to talk about so just talk about what you know about

188
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
She said well I know about couple bands and why don't you just bring up one or two MP3s

189
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It doesn't have to be a long show and if you feel comfortable then we'll do a couple more

190
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So I think we're gonna do that because she is completely completely

191
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Completely keyed into what's going on in underground

192
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It depends in a positive music here in the UK by the way

193
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
If you want to call in our voicemail numbers are open in New Jersey 2016256357 in the UK in London

194
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
O2076813753 really appreciate what's coming through it's cool

195
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's cool

196
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's not the weekend probably about 40 different voicemail comments

197
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Of course I can't use them all I told you with past that point

198
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Unless I just made the show a couple hours long that would be the only way to get to everything

199
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So over the weekend let's see Saturday gone up early went to Farrowks met up with Captain Dan

200
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Got the Delta Sierra started

201
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
There was no known on it by the way a note about the diesel airplane that my buddy from Farrowks had put on it

202
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But you know sticking stuff on to we don't really have windshield wipers

203
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You can stick stuff under so I guess someone removed that as they were moving the plane out of the hanger

204
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So first we went to Antwerp because I wanted to have a

205
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Well, you know, it's been what hasn't been 30 hours

206
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I didn't have to come back into my 50 hour until I'd flown 50 hours

207
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So the wind commander could you know do the 50 hours service on it

208
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But of course we'd had that issue with the spark plug

209
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'd had some issues with starting wasn't a real good cold starter

210
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Which actually turns out to be my fault

211
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I was priming it incorrectly

212
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Oh, and also the last time we were flying around the castle

213
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't know if Patricia mentioned this on the show

214
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And I had noticed it inside the cockpit as well

215
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I thought it was making a little bit more noise than normal

216
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Patricia had said you know you're flying around the cat flying around the cottage

217
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It sounded like you had a moped with a hole in your in your exhaust pipe

218
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Traveling out baby is just a soup dub engine

219
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And lo and behold Patricia was right

220
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And William and myself and a whole bunch of people said now that's not possible

221
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's brand new

222
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Well here's what happened when we were starting

223
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And we were trying to clear out the spark plug member that on our trip around just around Farrow

224
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Just in the neighborhood

225
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And we had a couple of backfires

226
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Well those were apparently powerful enough to blow out some of the

227
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Some of the actual damping stuff inside both exhaust

228
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So I can fly with it fine

229
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's no problem but it just does make more noise

230
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And it's kind of interesting that Patricia was the one who caught it

231
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Everything else is great not a drop of oil leaking out of this thing

232
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's it's flying perfect

233
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So then we went off to Rotterdam

234
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
To the jet center landed of course Dan stays there

235
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I went to visit with my mom

236
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I could you know even though she was really doing her best

237
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I could tell that Saturday was not a good day

238
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
She still has a lot of pain

239
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's the problem

240
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's really the pain from whatever is on the inside of her

241
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Pressing against her ribs which of course they

242
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
They nuked a couple weeks ago with radiation

243
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
When is day we hear from the doctors about her

244
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Most recent lung scan now she's already

245
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
She already has one lung that's been removed

246
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And they think they might have seen something on the remaining one

247
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Which of course would be quite a downer

248
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And what the doctor said is look

249
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We probably have something that we can treat it with which is a chemo pill

250
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Which stays pretty pretty much focused on one area

251
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But you have to be stronger just physically stronger

252
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Mentally she's she's there

253
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So she's got to eat you know got to eat more

254
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And she's eaten her appetite is there

255
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Nothing even the pain is not really getting rid of her appetite

256
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But it was just oh man fucking hate it

257
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You can see it you know once it was it was really different from from the week before

258
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And it just was not one of her good days

259
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So we're still fighting this fucker

260
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's for sure and mentally she's definitely there

261
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And that's what you need

262
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And thank you very much everybody for sending in your thoughts and prayers

263
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's very much appreciated and I tell my mom about it all the time

264
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And she loves it too

265
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Now here's I don't know if there's really anything

266
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Such as coincidence

267
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You've probably heard of this politician Tim Fortan who was assassinated

268
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Man what was it four years ago?

269
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
He was assassinated in the Netherlands just days before the general elections

270
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Where he probably would have swept the elections with his party

271
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And in fact there was a lot of you know he was considered to be the Dutch Le Pen

272
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And which was categorically untrue

273
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And if it just go on Google and look for out you know do search on me and the big lie

274
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I wrote extensively about it at the time

275
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
So I was a big fan of this guy

276
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Patricia and I knew him both personally

277
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Because we just met several different times

278
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And I liked a lot of what he was saying

279
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It was definitely something different than anybody else

280
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And it sounded like a guy was going to go kick some ass

281
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And that was exciting

282
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And the whole country was very excited about

283
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
The change that was underway

284
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You know finally everyone was sticking the heads up and saying

285
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yeah, let this guy have a go at it

286
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You know let's screw the man let this new guy come in and be the man

287
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
See if we like him

288
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And he was assassinated and

289
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And I think that that really

290
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
That the Netherlands lost a tremendous chance for a long, long time

291
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But there's still a lot of people who

292
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Try to carry on his thoughts in politics

293
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And it was a couple weeks ago

294
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
When I was at you know I landed at the jet center

295
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And you basically you call ahead and ask them to arrange for taxi

296
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And so I got this cab driver named Core

297
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Which is such a typical Rotterdam name Core

298
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And this is like 65 bald head

299
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You know big fine or supporter

300
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Of course me being from Amsterdam

301
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And Ajax being my team

302
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You know we kind of had a joke about that

303
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But Patricia's from Rotterdam you see

304
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And she is without a doubt the

305
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
The queen of that city

306
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And will be for a long, long time

307
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So everyone in Rotterdam loves my wife

308
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Just loves her

309
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So we're chatting away

310
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Like you know this is kind of a guy who's got those taxi air qualities

311
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That's my guy and Amsterdam

312
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You know as a guy who I can you know

313
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I can trust him to do stuff and get stuff

314
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And if he has to get my in laws or whatever

315
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I know that he'll be he'll do it and he'll do a great job

316
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And so I said dude from now on give me your phone number

317
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You're the guy

318
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And he's in local Rotterdam politics as well

319
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
As part of what used to be I think

320
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Late by Rotterdam which was

321
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Part of the whole idea of Pimfortan

322
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And then of course the guy with the bald head

323
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Which is the same as Pim had

324
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
There's a lot of similarities there

325
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Now I'm not anyone who can can keep a lighter or a pen

326
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Or any you know one of those little things

327
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I lose everything all the time

328
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You know I have one

329
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You for my credit cards my passport my money

330
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I've got you know one girly like bag that I just keep with me

331
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's kind of like a it's a wallet

332
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
But it's a bigger wallet

333
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
All it's just missing the strap and it will be a girly hand bag

334
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But everything's in there because I lose shit all the time

335
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
But in 2000 or 2001 before he was assassinated Pimfortan

336
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Probably 2001 gave me a pen just nothing special

337
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's a plastic ballpoint pen

338
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But it was of his political party lifestyle Pimfortan

339
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And I had not been able to lose this thing

340
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
We've been through three moves

341
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Amsterdam Belgium to the to the cottage

342
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And at all times of the day

343
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'd like open up my jacket

344
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Oh there's the damn Pimpan again

345
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And I and I would tell Patricia this and we laugh about it

346
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You know just once every couple of weeks or sometimes months

347
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Oh there's the Pimpan again

348
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And so I was coming I was late a little

349
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I was a little late leaving my mom

350
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
He of course he was there to pick me up and he waited 15-20 minutes

351
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And then we're in the car

352
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And and I said stop at the ATM because I got to get some euros

353
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Because I always you know like payment euros obviously

354
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's not that easy to get euros in Britain

355
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And I said I hope you know mine that I'm a little bit late today

356
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You know it being Saturday and all

357
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I guess sometimes he takes at least one day a week off

358
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
He said now it's okay I only have something tonight at 730

359
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So what is it? Well it's the it's the remembrance ceremony for Pim

360
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Because 6th May 2001 he was assassinated

361
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Was it 2002? I'm sorry

362
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
He was assassinated

363
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And so that was four years ago

364
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Today and we were talking about that and of course I remember the day well

365
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It was a huge media coverage and it actually happened

366
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
The assassination took place right outside of radio studio

367
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Where he just finished up a show with a body of mine

368
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Who I was doing a show without the time I wasn't there

369
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
But I was I was close enough to it to get a lot of the inside stuff

370
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And I've been on that parking lot a million times in my life

371
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And so we're chatting about that and I and I get out to go to the ATM

372
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And I opened up my girly bag and I get my card which by the way was refused

373
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Because I thought it was suspicious all of sudden money was being taken out of an ATM in Holland

374
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So I had to get another card but in the girly bag is the Pim for time pen

375
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Don't ask me how it got there and I said this cannot be coincidence

376
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You know this is it I said core due it's not much

377
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's but I just I and so I told him this whole story about the pan about how I and I gave it to him

378
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
So I don't know why but I have a feeling this is supposed to go to you and and it just

379
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Something about that moment that just told me that there maybe there is no coincidence

380
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Maybe there is stuff coming from up above who knows

381
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And then we flew back and it was as usual quite enjoyable

382
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Oh, I have to say though for this this is for the second time running

383
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
UK immigration has been awaiting me and we came in even after hours like a quarter of seven or seven p.m.

384
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Which we can do because we're on base just fill out a form

385
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
We do without control tower and everything and there was the same young woman waiting for me

386
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And she had said you know the previous time said look you've got all these stamps in your passport

387
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You come in the country all the time but if you're married to a European then it's no problem

388
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You can you can get a visa and you can come here and you can stay here and you can live here and you can work here and do whatever you want

389
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And I said okay I'll do that

390
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And so there she was again

391
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I said look we can't go on meeting like this and she didn't laugh

392
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So I knew that she was a little more serious this time

393
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And I said look the situation hasn't changed and here's why and I want you guys out there

394
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Maybe you can help me with this

395
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
So the first thing I'm actually going to be able to take care of the problem is we can't prove that

396
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Well we can prove that we're married to each other

397
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,000
But we have to have an up or steal an up or steal is kind of like a wax seal that proves that the document in this

398
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Case or wedding certificate is real and that it's official

399
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The problem is you have to go get that in person and it has to be the two of you and even worse than that

400
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
We actually have to get a new a copy of our certificate because we have the outdated form we've been married so long

401
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And the guy who married us dead

402
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So we're going to do that

403
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I think the with the 22nd or 23rd when we're in New York

404
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Patricia's going with me and then of course we're going to San Francisco so it's going to be fun

405
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
We're going to be on a little tour together

406
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
But what I what I'm really looking for is I'm sure that it's not as simple as just getting my European

407
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Family visa or whatever because it looks like you know with all things going the way the R

408
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
We will open up an office a pod show office in London

409
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
What I really need is an immigration lawyer and it's not you know

410
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I don't really need the advice. I just need someone to do this stuff for me because I'm busy and lazy

411
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
And stuff like that. I hate doing it. So if anyone out there hasn't you know just it's got to be a company that'll do that for me and

412
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And give me any advice I need I mean everything's all on the up and up. I'm a decent citizen

413
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I pay my taxes you know no issues there, but just whatever it is forms are calling or stamps. Please

414
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'd love it if someone could could help me out with that

415
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So you can just say anyone you know my way a daily source code.com

416
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You know actually I was

417
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Ah

418
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I was going to give a shout out to the guy who turned me on to Captain Dan and I had saved the piece of paper

419
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Now of course Patricia moved it once again. Maybe I moved it into my bag

420
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'll get that for tomorrow show. You're checking us out on serious stars 102

421
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Well, you're in luck because at 9 o'clock tonight eastern time we've got DVD weekly

422
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It's a fantastic podcast followed by CC Chapman who will take you up until 10 p.m.

423
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
On the way after the show Pacific Coast. Hellway used radio Don Andrew and Gilmore daily

424
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'll be back tomorrow as we continue our entire week here on the daily source code with your feedback

425
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
In my crap. Oh, that's a slogan for you. All right, everybody see tomorrow on the satellite that is and for those of you here

426
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Well, you get to hear about partsmith.

427
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I had a message Steve. Just a listening to your review on Joan Cohen

428
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Just a little bit of geography and British history.

429
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Hortmouth is a city. It has a cathedral. There's only one city in England

430
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Which doesn't have a cathedral. That's your Christmas weekend. Which one is it?

431
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
He got the good work right show by for now.

432
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Yeah, I appreciate it. And I was thinking all this weekend. I think it's got to be something obvious

433
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Like a gilford or maybe even more obvious like London, but I think London has a cathedral

434
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
So you kill me dude. I got to know what is it. Please. Let me know what it is.

435
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I had to encourage this issue a story.

436
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Okay, Stuart Wolf on second life.

437
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Just for make a little suggestion about the new Charlie Rewond

438
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
The only I enjoyed it, but the only problem was it lasted only 29 minutes.

439
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And I don't think that was enough time to share the whole of all the big things of a week.

440
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So my suggestion is to have it about 45 minutes so it can hopefully cover more of the subjects of week.

441
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Here's the cool thing about that, Stuart. I didn't put that.

442
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Excuse me, my microphone is a little bit crappy.

443
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
There we go. I didn't put that together. I think it was it's got Taylor who did that.

444
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Now I made a mistake on my thinking on this because I said if you want to put together a best of all

445
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'll be happy to put it on the feed over the weekend.

446
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And so I got the one from Scott and I put it up.

447
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And then promptly I saw this morning that I'd received another one as well.

448
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So I didn't of course figure that there might be multiple people putting these together.

449
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So I'm happy to put multiple ones and actually I'm going to move it to a separate feed.

450
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
That makes a lot more sense.

451
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Give me your feedback on that if you think I'm wrong.

452
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And I'm happy to put up as many best of us as people make.

453
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
So let's just experiment with that a little bit.

454
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It's kind of out of my hands, but I did listen to the one that Scott made.

455
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And as I said, I'm completely sick of listening to myself talking about second life.

456
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Hi, Adam. This is David.

457
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm here in sunny Southern California.

458
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
To entertain mid dot com behind the leddy mic.

459
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
He is my podcast that comes out over two weeks.

460
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I'm a mobile district here in the L.A.

461
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And I'm probably the only district in the fantasy area with a podcast.

462
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So there's a one sticker for me.

463
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So I'll just listen to BCS 380.

464
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Oh my gosh.

465
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You are absolutely right when it comes to doing your stuff.

466
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And actually not worrying about it.

467
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It's a show with actually perfect.

468
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It comes up so much better.

469
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I got it.

470
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
ABC Adam, the guy told you that you couldn't play a cowboy to say your ass.

471
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
That's what he told you.

472
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
But that is so true.

473
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Keep in coming out.

474
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It sounds great.

475
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And the bomb line is he doesn't have to be the perfect show.

476
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Our cast class doesn't have to run perfect.

477
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
As long as the show is continuing,

478
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
you keep worrying, joining it.

479
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And the continued is the laugh.

480
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And like you say, this call like me say,

481
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
that's what the show is all about.

482
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Good luck, Adam.

483
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And I'll catch you later.

484
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Tunes at attainment.com.

485
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Thanks, dude.

486
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And I really appreciated what you said there.

487
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And a lot of people sent me email similar to that saying,

488
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
you know, it looked.

489
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Don't let any topic overtake anything.

490
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And overtake the show because that's just no good for anybody.

491
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
But pretty much everyone who sent in an email or a comment said,

492
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
you know, I listened to this source code because you have different things.

493
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And there are different places.

494
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And you do different things.

495
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Different setups, different types of recordings.

496
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
But also different topics.

497
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And some people fast forward through the Metro moment or Trinity.

498
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And I've got those cute up for this week,

499
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
by the way, as well.

500
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I've got some good ones for you.

501
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And last week I was, I put a shout out and said,

502
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
hey, how about hypnotism?

503
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Can we hypnotize someone through a podcast?

504
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And I got some good feedback on that.

505
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Mark Dond gave me a quote from the

506
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,000
part of a world English dictionary, which is copyright 1989 by the Microsoft Corporation.

507
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Here it is.

508
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
The word is automaton.

509
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
A machine that contains its own power source and can perform a complicated series of actions,

510
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
including responses to external stimuli without human intervention or two.

511
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Somebody who resembles a machine by obeying instructions automatically,

512
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
performing repetitive actions or showing no emotion.

513
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I don't think that's what I'm talking about.

514
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
In fact, I'd probably want to program you to have an emotion.

515
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Like laughter.

516
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
That would be the good one, wouldn't it?

517
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Michael Dean says, hey, I'm no expert in psychology,

518
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
but I heard about and have tried brain wave therapy.

519
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Apparently a person could be influenced by a series of tones

520
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
at a certain frequency to change moods.

521
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Our bodies function because of electrons.

522
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Also states of mind like alertness, depression,

523
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
sexation are supposedly controlled by what frequency those electronic signals are passed through the brain.

524
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
So in theory, we can deliberately program or steer our state of mind in whatever direction we're willing to let it go.

525
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Much like being hypnotized, the key is, as it is with anything,

526
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
you have to truly be willing to allow yourself to do that.

527
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
So there's this software I came across that has samples of these tones that you listen to with ear buds that will do this.

528
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Some of them are sort of like sessions of therapy and some are to heal headaches.

529
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It was all very interesting to me.

530
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Okay, so he has a link here. Let me just pop this link for a second.

531
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Let me see if I can, oh, no, he didn't, that's not a link.

532
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
That's a link to his email.

533
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Oh, that's why I put, of course.

534
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Well, Michael, you didn't give me the link, dude.

535
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Please send me the link.

536
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Now I want to check out these tones and see if we can alter states of mind through the daily source code.

537
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Send me the link, please.

538
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Ed Ross says, dude, I'm not sure that attempting hypnotism on a podcast is such a good idea.

539
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Consider those who drive or fly while listening.

540
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Okay, they could try to turn the podcast off till they're in a safe place.

541
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
But what if they really want to listen to it?

542
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Yeah, there's something to it.

543
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Hi, Ed, this is David. I'm here.

544
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Sorry about that.

545
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Operator error.

546
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Hey, Ed, this is at the zero from the area 51 group.

547
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I'm just listening to the Charlie number 381 today.

548
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And you've been talking a lot lately about mind programming, science.

549
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Scientology, psychology.

550
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And it made me think about a book I just read called The Game by Neil Strauss.

551
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And this book is a real life documentary about how a bunch of nerds use the internet and something called

552
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Neural Inglistic Programming.

553
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
In order to become really successful with beautiful women.

554
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
These are the internet is sort of a debugging tool.

555
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
They would try things and then report on their values on success.

556
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
The Neural Inglistic Programming is a real legitimate science invented in the 1970s by

557
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Psychologist and a computer programmer.

558
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
It's totally worth checking out the game as far as I'm concerned.

559
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It's the best introduction to Neural Inglistic Programming.

560
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And it's really entertaining.

561
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I couldn't put the book down.

562
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I know you like it.

563
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So give it a shot that book is the game by Neil Strauss.

564
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Talk to you later.

565
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Yeah, Matt.

566
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And I appreciate you talking about a book on the podcast because we don't do that enough.

567
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And we really do need to read.

568
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
That is important.

569
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And I try to read a book on the plane these days just to just to keep up and just to keep the

570
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
mind going on different types of verbal or visual input really.

571
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah, I've read the game.

572
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I've also listened to all of Anthony Robbins tapes.

573
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
So I'm quite familiar with NLP or Neural Inglistic Programming.

574
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:30,000
In fact, Senseo, the Senseo and the Burp is a textbook example of Neural Inglistic Programming.

575
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It's worked on.

576
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Well, let me just say conservatively tens of thousands of daily source code listeners.

577
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
It's carried over to my house.

578
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
My daughter does it.

579
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And even though Patricia will never, ever, ever cop to the fact that she burps out loud,

580
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
she does it.

581
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And there's always it.

582
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Senseo coming from the other room.

583
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
So it does work.

584
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I'm just interested in at these tones.

585
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
That seems like the stuff that Dean sent me.

586
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
That will be very cool to see if we can do more.

587
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Because it's all kind of simplistic stuff.

588
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
But yeah, the NLP definitely works.

589
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And if you've got any more thoughts about books or stuff, send it in for sure.

590
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Our voice mail lines again in New Jersey, 201, 625, 6357 or in London,

591
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
O207, 68137, 5353.

592
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
As said, Patricia and I go to New York.

593
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Ron and I are speaking on a panel as well.

594
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
One session I think at the Bear Stearns Financial Who Block Conference, which will be fun.

595
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Then we're going to go to see the 24th of 25th is a retreat.

596
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
It's called the CEO retreat.

597
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I think it's all of the CEOs.

598
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And I guess even though Ron's a CEO, and I'm just a lowly president, I'm allowed to go.

599
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Our one of our lead investors, Kleiner Perkins, puts that on once a year.

600
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And it's held at Pebble Beach.

601
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So we're going to go.

602
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And I think they got some good speakers there.

603
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Charlie Rose is going to speak.

604
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
There's some fantastic woman who is going to be giving a speech.

605
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I think holding a seminar which actually Patricia wants to check out.

606
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And of course it's golfing, which we won't do because we don't want to embarrass ourselves.

607
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
We might hit the driving range.

608
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I'm sure Ron will be more than happy to help us out a little bit if we have some time.

609
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And we should have time.

610
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Then it's either two San Francisco or back to San Francisco.

611
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
We'll stay through the weekend.

612
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I think we'll probably stay through Monday.

613
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And then we'll come home.

614
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
And then I'll probably do a week and a half turn around and come right back out.

615
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Because I've got to be back in the San Francisco office really for a couple of weeks at a time.

616
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Because we're so close now.

617
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
In fact, over the weekend, I fired up the dashboard and it's working.

618
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's working.

619
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I've now, I no longer use iTunes.

620
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Unless I want to put something onto my iPod, all I have to do is fire up iTunes.

621
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It knows what shows I want, how I want to categorize.

622
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
The playlists are all the same as they are in the dashboard.

623
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And it just sticks it right under my iPod in exact duplication of what I'm getting online.

624
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
But I'm loving it.

625
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I am totally loving it.

626
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Now, of course, this is bringing stuff down in real time.

627
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
So it's a little different.

628
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
But the experience with broadband is exactly what it should be.

629
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And there's more stuff we could do while we're out in San Francisco.

630
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Hello, Adam.

631
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
It's Ranger Craig.

632
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I'm the lock.

633
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I'll catch my eyes island.

634
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Hey, you're going to be in town sometimes since he's come out and see me.

635
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Finally, went to go daddy and register, Ranger Craig.com, although I don't have a page to do with it yet.

636
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So just temporarily, we're directing it to my scrapper page before I decide what I'm doing.

637
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
We're still helping to start some podcasts here from the rock.

638
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And that's a lot of things I've just opened to talk to you when you're about when you're in town.

639
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,000
So I'm looking up when you're here in the city, Baghdad by the Bay San Francisco.

640
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
We'll see you soon.

641
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Bye-bye.

642
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Baghdad by the Bay?

643
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
All right, Ranger Craig.

644
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
We want to come, definitely.

645
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So if you're there on the weekend, count us in.

646
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
The last time I checked, we don't have a whole lot of songs to feature the cowbell.

647
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Hey, daily source code listeners.

648
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
This is Kevin Crossman from the Frappac Tributes podcast.

649
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
You know, there aren't a lot of podcasts at feature the cowbell either.

650
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Except for, of course, the Charlie.

651
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
On our podcast, we cover all those guys in this comedy movies like Ben Stiller, Vince Fawn,

652
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
The Wilson Brothers, and yes, Will Ferrell.

653
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
So we're a big fan of cowbells too.

654
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Adam must be a big fan of the Frappac because he's been playing clips from dodgeball when

655
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
he crashes and recent shows.

656
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And if you want to catch up with all the news on the summer movies coming out from the Frappac,

657
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
you definitely want to check out the Frappac Tributes podcast.

658
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Just go to frappacpodcast.com.

659
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Come on, do it. Lay on right here, do it.

660
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Do it.

661
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Do you believe anything is possible?

662
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
We do.

663
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Where are flink?

664
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
We believe in an internet that's safe from viruses and scammers.

665
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Where are flink?

666
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
We believe your personal information should be just that personal.

667
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000

673
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Hi, Adam.

674
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
This is Valerie in Toronto.

675
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
DescriptionTO.blogspot.com.

676
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
That's where my podcast is.

677
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And I have an audio comment about this virtual reality thing.

678
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
You've gotten into that the wives don't seem to understand.

679
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I'm thinking, maybe you could have a segment on second life like you do for Trinity or

680
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
the heterosexual moment, Metro sexual moment.

681
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
That's not a weird.

682
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
You know, the other regular segments you have.

683
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So it's not like you're talking about it every day.

684
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Driving some people nuts.

685
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
But you could compartmentalize it and have it every once in a while

686
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
to kind of update people on how your business thing is going there.

687
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Any events that might be coming up you're involved in.

688
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Or just the issues that come up in second life.

689
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Because I just joined up because you mentioned it.

690
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And I'm some sort of slave.

691
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I don't know.

692
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
But it sounded interesting.

693
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And I'm not really a game RPG even chat person.

694
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But I've been in it for about two, three days.

695
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Well, on and off.

696
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And it's really interesting and it brings up a lot of interesting issues.

697
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And I've had a really great time and met some really great people.

698
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And I think it's worth talking about.

699
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
But yeah, the potential is there to get a little too.

700
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Obsessed with talking about it because it's so immersive.

701
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And yeah, that can drive people nuts who don't get it.

702
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
But if you can put into some sort of packages, sort of update people like me,

703
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
who are sort of starting on it and sort of get it.

704
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And you've got stuff with really great potential that you could have going there.

705
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And I know you're working on that to just kind of put it in a little place there.

706
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And then see where it goes from there.

707
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
So that's my suggestion.

708
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I hope you think about it. You've got to be thinking about it for as much as this is.

709
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
You've been thinking about second life in general lately.

710
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So making consideration and try that out maybe.

711
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And thank you so much.

712
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
As usual for the ideas you put into my head for me to try out.

713
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It's your great amazing source of information.

714
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I think that's part of what the source code's about.

715
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So thanks again and take care and I'll be listening.

716
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Please.

717
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
No, thank you.

718
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Peace back at you.

719
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Nice voice, by the way.

720
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Like that.

721
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Well, you did a good job, I would say.

722
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Did a good job right there.

723
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Yeah, it's just the, I think I got a little over-obsessed with talking about it.

724
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
That's all.

725
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
It's definitely not all of my day.

726
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
You know, in fact, there's a very small portion.

727
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
But a fun portion.

728
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And sometimes exhausting portion.

729
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
While you were talking, Patricia came in.

730
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
She's so fantastic.

731
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm holding here the most beautifully made BLT.

732
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And I think BLT is the same in the UK as it is in the States.

733
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Bacon lettuce tomato, tomato.

734
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Oh, it's so good.

735
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
But she didn't have time to talk.

736
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
So I'll try and get her on tomorrow.

737
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
There are more people doing interesting things in second life though.

738
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip.

739
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Here he is.

740
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Hiya, I'm Carrie.

741
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Guess whom I have met in person in second life yesterday?

742
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:01,000
It was Jeff Smith, who is making theme songs for Pat Castas for reasonable money.

743
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
We were chatting about making theme songs for me.

744
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And he mentioned that.

745
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
His little daughter is running around the house and singing comic strip,

746
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
blogger, comic strip, blogger, theme song.

747
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Wow, that's scary, don't you think?

748
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
So speaking of second life, Adam,

749
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
make it please meet Roger Smalls up.

750
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You both live in fucking gulfot.

751
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And he is now sad and bitter because he has no credit card to join second life.

752
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
So please meet him in R.L.

753
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
known as real life and cheer him up.

754
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You?

755
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
You?

756
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Yeah, I've sent an email to Roger.

757
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I've not heard back from him.

758
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I hope he's okay.

759
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
It's very unlike him to be silent all this while.

760
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
So let's just hope that he's okay.

761
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I don't think he was going on holiday.

762
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I mean, I just don't know.

763
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I really don't know.

764
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
But it's been weeks now since we've heard from him.

765
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
So I'm a bit concerned.

766
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Maybe it's some problem with the draft and darts thing,

767
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
because he said he couldn't make that.

768
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And that also didn't seem very Roger like.

769
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Maybe he was there after all.

770
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Maybe he'd actually met me and thought what a dick.

771
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I don't want to send anything to him.

772
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
But your influence reaches far and wide comic strip blogger

773
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
because this is what I received this morning from the Jeff Smith.

774
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Dude, look at this stuff.

775
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Second life, man.

776
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
What is all this stuff?

777
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Is that a pig?

778
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It's that stupid, all that crazy stuff.

779
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
On my phone.

780
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Second life.

781
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
It's that stupid, all that crazy stuff.

782
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
On my phone.

783
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Second life.

784
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Second life.

785
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
What is all this stuff?

786
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Ow!

787
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Watch out.

788
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Can you hear me?

789
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Can you learn how to fly?

790
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
See you all night.

791
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Come on, man.

792
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
No guns and running.

793
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I like the castle is closed.

794
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I'm out of here.

795
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
It's crazy.

796
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
No, you are crazy.

797
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I think that's a Jeff's artistic way of saying,

798
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
man, I kind of got interested and sucked into that second life thing.

799
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Yeah, like big fro.

800
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
That was pretty cool.

801
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
So just a quick update on what's going on.

802
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I've gotten most of the land I wanted around the castle.

803
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
So now I can actually move the castle onto two parcels,

804
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
which will enable me to put down more cool stuff for us to play with.

805
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
And also having an area we can throw down anything you want.

806
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And I can clean it up later.

807
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Most of the stuff now auto returns after 15 minutes.

808
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And check out the beach if you haven't, by the way.

809
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
We've got some cool places to lay down.

810
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Yeah, that's fun.

811
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Now, what's really cool is we're going to be organizing some events.

812
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
And in, well, I think it should start in the next couple of weeks.

813
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And already met someone who potentially could organize some events for us.

814
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Of course, I'm thinking pod save music.

815
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Meet the meet a podcaster.

816
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I'm even thinking fashion shows actually.

817
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
And that's going to take place at the palace.

818
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And that's coming along quite well.

819
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
But something that's more interesting.

820
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So how happy someone picked up on this is really that we have been working towards

821
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
this type of metaphor for a long, long time, even in our vocabulary.

822
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Maybe not really with us noticing it.

823
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Hey Adam, this is Jeff from National Tennessee.

824
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I was just calling to make a comment.

825
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
One year.

826
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
What year's talking about how we go to websites and how we go to places.

827
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Well, that kind of thing.

828
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
It's fun.

829
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Interesting.

830
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
How people don't associate themselves with the way they live anymore.

831
00:44:51,000 --> 00:45:00,000
But more, you know, I'm Jeff from yummybones.com or, you know, associate ourselves with

832
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
our websites now instead of the places we live.

833
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I thought that was kind of interesting.

834
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
And I figured you're going to take on it.

835
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
All right.

836
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Nice again.

837
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Dude.

838
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I'm so there with you.

839
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I even thought about that.

840
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
You used to say, it all depends.

841
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
You know, it's really what label you hang on yourself.

842
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
You used to be.

843
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I'm Adam from Jersey.

844
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Now it might be.

845
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I'm Adam from Pod Show.

846
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Or I'm Adam from the Daily Source Code or Adam at curry.com.

847
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
You're so right.

848
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And we're from there.

849
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
We're going to places when we go to website.

850
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
That's how we talk.

851
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I'm going to CNN.

852
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I'm going to the BBC website.

853
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Like I'm walking over there.

854
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
You know, you're clicking.

855
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And I'm from fill in the blank.

856
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So I think in our minds, we've all, you know, really pick up a copy of Snow Crash.

857
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
You really should.

858
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
You know, and maybe I think somewhere I have the audio book.

859
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I told you have the unabridged version, which is like seven hours long.

860
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Maybe I'll get a snippet from that.

861
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
It's a fantastic book.

862
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
You really got to read that.

863
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And now we're from our sponsor.

864
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
It's the Yanks versus the Brits.

865
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
We'll drive each other crazy.

866
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
But everybody knows that it's apparent to see.

867
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
They're just like you and me.

868
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
It's the Yanks and the Brits.

869
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
The Yanks versus the Brits.

870
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Mind the gap.

871
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Yes, please.

872
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,000
So even though I still have a whole bunch of them stacked up, including a great one from PWB,

873
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
which is going to be moved again.

874
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
PWB to tomorrow.

875
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I'm sorry.

876
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I'm just running out of time.

877
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
We're already at 46 minutes.

878
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I still have one song.

879
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I want to play for you today.

880
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
This was about the flyer I got in the mail about the water butt.

881
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And I'm not necessarily interested in a water butt.

882
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
And a water butt pump.

883
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Well, of course, I knew there had to be a logical explanation for it.

884
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I had them water butt.

885
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Yes, very interesting.

886
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Well, it's interesting because over here we don't use the word butt, really.

887
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
We use the word bum, which you mean,

888
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
which you Americans know means something entirely different.

889
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
So it's all very confusing.

890
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
But water butt over here is just something you collect,

891
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
rainwater in.

892
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
What's it called in America?

893
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,000
So yeah, we collect rainwater as it comes off the roof and down the down pipe in a water butt.

894
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And I guess a water butt pump would be able to pump it out of there onto the garden.

895
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
So for me, it doesn't sound like anything is very funny,

896
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
but I can understand why it's funny to Americans.

897
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
But there you go. That's what it is.

898
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Thanks a lot. Bye bye.

899
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
No, thank you.

900
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Thank you. You're so right. It's a butt versus a bum.

901
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Right arm.

902
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And it just goes to show that how confusing it all can really be.

903
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Definitely.

904
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Although looking at the size of some of the butts in the United States,

905
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I think they've been filling up with rainwater too.

906
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Okay.

907
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Well, I had something written down.

908
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Shoot, there was one more thing I was going to say.

909
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I can't remember.

910
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Other than that, Patricia and I are off to look at a house this afternoon.

911
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
We were scheduled around 2.30, so I've got about two hours, two hours to run.

912
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
And it's right near the center of town, yet it's kind of secluded on a hill.

913
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I mean, it could be the next curry dwelling.

914
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
We're very excited about it.

915
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Another reason by the way, why I need some help with my immigration papers to get it all set up

916
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
and square it away. I don't want to get any trouble trying to purchase this place.

917
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
If it turns out to be what we really want.

918
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And just one more thing on the Yangtze versus the Brits,

919
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I have noticed, I will say,

920
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
when you use British slang,

921
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
that that does make people happy.

922
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And so it's not saying tomato.

923
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
In fact, if you say tomato versus tomato,

924
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
or podcast versus podcast,

925
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
they're probably good annoyed.

926
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
But if you say, oh, man, the bill was waiting for me,

927
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
the bill meeting the cops,

928
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
or something similar, that's when they all take notes of, hey,

929
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
this guy's paying attention.

930
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Just an observation, a slight one.

931
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
But when he might be interested in it,

932
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
a Iraqi regime could launch a biological or chemical attack

933
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
in his little is 45 minutes.

934
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I love this song.

935
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Reminds me of Paul Hardcastle's 19.

936
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Want some soul?

937
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Want some soul?

938
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Without any question,

939
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
45 minutes.

940
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Lies, spin and true.

941
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Five minutes.

942
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Now, 45 minutes.

943
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Still trying to,

944
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
45 minutes.

945
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Stiff, stiff,

946
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
45 minutes.

947
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Trying to, trying to, trying 45 minutes.

948
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Still trying to,

949
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
45 minutes.

950
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Technical Rood 45 minutes.

951
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
By logical,

952
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
45 minutes.

953
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
You.

954
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Cl Took the40.

955
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
45 minutes.

956
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
45 minutes.

957
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
For the 45 minutes.

958
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
For the 45 minutes.

959
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
For the 45 minutes.

960
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
45 minutes.

961
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
45 minutes.

962
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
For the 45 minutes.

963
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Before the 45 minutes.

964
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
According to the British guy,

965
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
write.

966
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Ahh.

967
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Well hello everyone, I have to accept

968
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Right, I have to accept

969
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
40, 40, 40, 40, 45 minutes

970
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I have to accept

971
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
That we haven't found them

972
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:58,000
45 minutes, 45 minutes, 45 minutes

979
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:38,760
You know I would change the title from lie spin and truth the 45 minutes.

980
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:45,260
It's called 45 minutes, this could be a huge hit in the clubs and let me just underlying

981
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:49,620
why I think that it's possible, I'm playing this, I'm playing this in my computer this

982
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:53,320
morning as I'm doing my show, Patricia walks in and says what's that, and you know when

983
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,380
she walks in and says what's that?

984
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,780
It's got something going for it.

985
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,620
She can predict these things.

986
00:53:58,620 --> 00:53:59,580
Fantastic.

987
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:02,180
Quantum Soul from the UK.

988
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:04,580
Form in 2002 after years of jamming and producing

989
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:07,180
with a friend of mine started making beats in my computer

990
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,980
at University and Leeds hooked up with some pretty

991
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:11,580
talented musicians up there and got producing all sorts

992
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,020
of different sounds when pushing the vibes

993
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,900
since then and now looking to get out there.
