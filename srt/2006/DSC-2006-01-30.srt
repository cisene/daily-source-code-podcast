00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 3-2-6

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
60 million dollars worth of airplane strapped my ass

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We don't need lost thinking crazy

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I like to think I'm flying into this genre

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh, fantastic

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's a brand new week, are you ready for a whole new round new chances?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's a Monday from the cottage, it's the source code

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I like to think I'm flying into this genre

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I like to think I'm flying into this genre

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I like to think I'm flying into this genre

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I like to think I'm flying into this genre

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I like to think I'm flying into this genre

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I like to think I'm flying into this genre

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I like to think I'm flying into this genre

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I like to think I'm flying into this genre

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I like to think I'm flying into this genre

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I like to think I'm flying into this genre

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Good road action

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
rated up for me also

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
but see you seeking as fast as billions of thousands

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
wow, that bad god

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
from between our demons

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Turn up on the background, come from the north side of the town, come out of my nose, but they have nothing else you do.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Who could've been a rat, I'm covered a little time there for you to excuse.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah, I thought it could've been a rat, I'm covered a little time there for you to reduce.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:11,000
When I think of you who came earlier, I think of you joking out of me tonight.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The only one who came and failed love, they tell me what you've written This brown spy was behaving harshly hurts a little for you.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:57,000

31
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,240
All of the robots have been manned together, but still tears

32
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,640
Then you would never come, got me in

33
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,640
Could be the right time, could be the little time that for you to excuse

34
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,640
Yeah, could be the right time that for you to be used

35
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:47,840
No use in iron, the things will be made never, and all of a sudden

36
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,840
Just won't tell me, tell me what you're doing

37
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,840
I still have left, a little for you

38
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:15,840
No use in iron, the things will be made never, and all of a sudden

39
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:28,840
Hey, no use in iron, the things will be made never, and all of a sudden

40
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,840
Just won't tell me, tell me what you're doing

41
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,840
I still have left, a little for you

42
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:52,840
No use in iron, the things will be made never, and all of a sudden

43
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:03,840
Just won't tell me, tell me what you're doing

44
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,840
I still have left, a little for you

45
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,840
No, no, it's me

46
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,840
Nothing like taking all the source code with a song and a bit of a mind sound

47
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,840
Go water's bad, no use driving

48
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,840
Whoops, sounds like we missed a bit of the ending there on the download, makes no matter

49
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,840
How you doing everybody, it's the daily source code Monday coming to you from Curry Cottage

50
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,840
And it's been a very busy morning, I just got back from Ferrox Airfield, Echo Golf Tango

51
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,840
To pick up my lovely bride who was delivered

52
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,840
Nicely, neat little package, the wind commander and Nick flew in in the moony to bring her back

53
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,840
As you know, my own playing the sessina is awaiting his new engine waiting for parts

54
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,840
It's all going to be put together and we chose the interior colors and everything's going to be great

55
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,840
By the way, let's just call it the Delta Sierra if we're talking about the plane because that's actually the call sign is November 277 Delta Sierra

56
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,840
So we'll just call it Delta Sierra from now on

57
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,840
So of course, you know, that takes good two hours to get out there on time, hang out

58
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,840
We had a cup of tea, had a bite to eat and then to Patricia back and so we're back and I'm on the microphones on the cast blast that

59
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
Getting you some daily source code interesting

60
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:48,840
Yesterday I spent a lot of time searching round for stuff and this may be a new thread that we just opened up Patricia said Friday night

61
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,840
She she slept in in Rotterdam at her sister's house and so she told me Saturday

62
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:06,840
Was it Saturday or Sunday? Maybe it was yesterday. She said, wow, I've slept so well here. You know, she has a little bit of arthritis in her hands and a little bit in her back and she said, I don't feel anything at all

63
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
And the immediate conclusion she drew was

64
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:18,840
That it's due to cell phone towers, which are actually very near by the house. It's funny when you see the house

65
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,840
Patricia, of course, as you know, she found the place she got everything together. She decided this was the place that we're going to stay for a while

66
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
Just a rental

67
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,840
She never actually saw the building next door, which is DEFRA

68
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,840
DEFRA is the what is the stand for department of

69
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,840
I should have looked that up shouldn't I I'll look it up when I'm talking about it

70
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,840
DEFRA are the same guys who who not only take care of agriculture, but I guess they

71
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,840
They make sure you don't bring your dogs in illegally, so we definitely dealt with them in the

72
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,840
The time that we've been here. Let me see. I'm just going to go to DEFRA.gov.uk

73
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,840
I'll give you exactly what it stands for department for environment food and rural affairs

74
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:07,840
So this all kind of came together because Patricia mentioned that to me. I just seen a neighborhood kind of like a neighborhood

75
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,840
What is it committee type thing?

76
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,840
They send around they want you to donate 10 bucks and they take care of all the parking problems and all that stuff and here at the back I read

77
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:27,840
It was mentioned that all mobile phone masks at DEFRA will be removed by the time employees vacate the site in 2007

78
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,840
So like wow how coincidental is that that she's talking about cell phone towers may be bothering her arthritis

79
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:40,840
And at the same time I read that so I immediately set off to look for two things one is the effects of cell phone towers and I'd have to say these are

80
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,840
These are micro transmitters not macro, but

81
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:51,840
No macro transmitters not micro these are pretty big puppies and I'd say that they are close enough to definitely have an effect

82
00:08:51,840 --> 00:09:00,840
On something at least just reading through the literature, but I can't find anything related to arthritis although Patricia is very very sensitive to

83
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
RF radio frequency and to electricity

84
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:10,840
I mean we've actually moved beds in houses because she said I can hear the electricity in the wall and like okay

85
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
That's cool

86
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Meanwhile the

87
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,840
Why guess because it's DC current her

88
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:24,840
Her heated bed she likes to have her feet heated while she sleeps that doesn't seem to bother her at all

89
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:32,840
But you know who knows what's going on now the course the second thing I went looking for is to see if the department

90
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,840
For the environment food and rural affairs if they indeed are leaving in 2007 and what's going to happen to this monumental space next door

91
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:47,840
Because you know my next the next house we we will live in will I hope will be one that we that we build ourselves and

92
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Patricia it's really bothering her. I then we have to move. I mean, that's clear

93
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,840
So I also spend some time looking to real estate market and

94
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,840
I'm not really ready for it

95
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,840
But anyway, if you have any information on that

96
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:08,840
On either differ leaving Gilford in 2007 or on the effective cell phone tower specifically on arthritis. I'd love to hear about it quote of the day

97
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,840
This comes from Scott Adams from the Gilbert principle

98
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:21,840
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes art is knowing which ones to keep and I really like that quote

99
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,840
Because I think that is indeed exactly what podcasting is showing us and many other forms of

100
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Of stuff will create ourselves you know web logs are raw and and so are podcasts and I agree that the mistakes that you know if they're the right ones to leave in that is true

101
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
Really art

102
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
It's a beautiful thing

103
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:50,840
We're talking on I don't know if it's Thursday or Friday about Google in China, which of course is what everybody seems to be talking about these days

104
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
First thing I noticed

105
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,840
And I think I have a couple of actually have a couple of emails about this. Let's listen to this audio comment because

106
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,840
If you're not awake after that cool waters bands song you will be after this

107
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:10,840
And this is rubber head from the rubber room radio show available at rubber room radio.net

108
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:22,840
I got audio feedback comment here for you from something you were talking about on DSC 324 talking about Google censoring content in their web searches in China

109
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:31,840
I just got a message for all of those who've been bashing Google for trying to provide China with some sort of means to access information in their

110
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:37,840
Horrible starving country you know you're all bunch of hypocrites. I want you all to go look in your closets

111
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Now your proverbial closets where your skeletons are but your actual physical closets where you keep your clothes go get your clothes

112
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Go on take them out of the closet there and look at the tags how many of them say made in China

113
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:58,840
Is it doing business with Chinese sweatshops more heinous than blocking search results or how about those of you who don't have a nice Trinity poop mobile

114
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Do you realize that China owns the second largest oil company in the world are you about to stop driving to help your brothers and sisters in China

115
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,840
Think about it a communist country owns a giant private oil company

116
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,840
I don't remember which one could look it up cheese what about the furniture you plant your fat ass on each day

117
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,840
You were looking under the sofa and see if it was stamped with a made in a communist oppressive abortion mandating evil Google censoring country

118
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,840
Trying to say is that it's real easy to start bashing a search engine

119
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
But it's a hell of a lot harder to live 100%

120
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,840
Socially conscious all the time and bashing Google doesn't get you off the hook

121
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
All right

122
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Okay, I feel much better Adam. Thank you for letting me get that off my chest and my show the rubber room radio show

123
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,840
I don't spew a lot of political rants like this one

124
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,840
But I do play some really weird twisted music and you could check it out at rubber room radio.net

125
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:01,840
And Adam be sure to give those paparazzi but holes hell you've lived in America long enough to know how to sue the bastards

126
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:12,840
All right have a good next lot. All right, dude. Rubber room. Rubber hit. Love it. Yeah, I think this is maybe a classic case of projection

127
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,840
I think that the reason why mainstream media and journalists in particular are really jumping into this and also a lot of bloggers

128
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:28,840
Maybe there's projection that we feel that maybe some of our civil rights such as freedom of speech are being squelched a little bit or well, maybe maybe

129
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,840
Maybe there's so much freedom of speech that no one can hear it anymore. That's also possible

130
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,840
JT from ciopodcast.com is scutops.com. Rob mean emails has been a while since we communicated, but

131
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:47,840
I'm sitting here listening to daily source code 324 and yes, I'm in China, but look what the world needs to understand about this Google thing is rather simple

132
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,840
English reading Chinese simply use the English version of Google and can basically get whatever they want

133
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,840
They can get prawn or basically you know anything the desire there are more details that I won't get into here

134
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:04,840
But in general when I'm in China, I can get to most of the new sites all of the podcasting sites I desire

135
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,840
And I listen to stuff like distorted view and other stuff that would be considered questionable here

136
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:16,840
Now the Google stuff and censored Microsoft stuff really applies to the Chinese versions of these three sites of these sites

137
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:23,840
What also needs to be realized is that most people in China speak English English is taught to all Chinese growing up for those who really want the information it is there

138
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,840
And he says tailwinds all right JTK

139
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,840
presuming your an arman. Yes tailwinds absolutely back at you. Who's guys all that stuff

140
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:38,840
So this is interesting first of all because I said if you're in China and you can hear this out of my voice, please let me know so maybe it's not

141
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:46,840
Such a big deal. Yes, I understand that the connectivity to the Google.com is rather spotty and you know, I don't know

142
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:52,840
Maybe the banging keys against the ethernet connector or something to try and make it you know to discourage people from using it

143
00:14:52,840 --> 00:15:00,840
But apparently they don't have the technology to close. You know this great firewall of China sounds like it's not that great as it's

144
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:07,840
Perhaps portrayed and then anyone can reach the regular Google but the Chinese Google is a customized version. Okay

145
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:15,840
That to me is almost like an enterprise sales. That's where they they should list that on there on the 10Qs enterprise sales to the

146
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:22,840
People's Republic of China incorporated they created a special version of Google. I wonder. I wonder if they got paid

147
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840
Little Scottish last

148
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Is now

149
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,840
Trying to teach me gaelic which of course is a perfect

150
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,840
A perfect way to code

151
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:42,840
Transmissions to the people's Republic of China as we teach them gaelic we learn gaelic and we're set

152
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,840
And I got some

153
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,840
Like a big panic

154
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,840
Message from PW Fenton who produces all the

155
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,840
The pod shows on serious of course if you're listening to stars one or three on serious then here you go

156
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,840
PW is responsible for it

157
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,840
What's interesting is that I'm ending at exactly when the when the sound blows

158
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:15,840
But he's saying I'm consistently 10 seconds late so it's very possible that this clock just doesn't run on time

159
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,840
So we're keeping our eye on it for today as I get down to the last 30 seconds

160
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,840
When the before the satellite window closes all of double check with you

161
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,840
And then Sean Rife said I heard you're talking about the countdown clock sound being owned by

162
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Oh, gag

163
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
Sony

164
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,840
Want to let you know that you're not the only one using it Kim commando who was a nationally syndicated radio

165
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,840
Who has a nationally syndicated radio show about computers and technology uses the exact same sound in a weekly radio show

166
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,840
In fact, she seems to use it in every episode

167
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:48,840
I don't know what this means but wanted to pass this little bit of info on it seems that if you're going to incur the wrath of Sony she would too

168
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,840
No, that's not necessarily true if this song of this sound which you'll hear in seven minutes and 45 seconds from now

169
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:01,840
Approximately if this sound has been, well, interesting if they

170
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:08,840
Most people make jingle sounds and convert and music for commercial submit that to ask cap or BMI what is it it's not

171
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,840
I don't know if they submitted to ask have BMI I guess they do I yeah, that would make sense

172
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,840
And then so every single time it's used and then there's the so called sync fee

173
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:25,840
But this to me sounds like it's something that someone put out there and it's just been used all over the place if you're the originator of it, please let me know

174
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:33,840
I'd love to get permission to continue using it and I'm sure that the folks at countdown clock would like that as well as would

175
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,840
What is that the show in

176
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:47,840
I forget was a TV show that uses it was that in Canada for some reason I'm thinking that and Kim Kamando is interesting how stuff like that travels around the world

177
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,840
It's probably the same as a couple of the drops that come in cast blaster

178
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,840
I'm not sure if if we created them or if they were taken off of royalty free stuff

179
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,840
I mean we're not charging money for him. We just kind of throw him in as an extra diddy like this

180
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,840
Or the yeah, of course, and then we have the

181
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,840
Right

182
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,840
Which of course is just how it provides for hours of fun when the first time you download cast blaster

183
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,840
So keeping our eye on it for for Peter make sure we don't mess up the timing today

184
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,840
From the thousands of podcasts available today

185
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,840

But don't have the ability to create your own tracks to complete your visions

204
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
A rap or pop artist

205
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,840
Then contact our cadian reading

214
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,840
Stop dreaming of making a record and start today

215
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,840
I'm sure that that stuff is going to happen

216
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,840
I just want to make sure everyone hears about these places we can go and collaborate

217
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,840
Like, was it myvirtualband.com is another one of those

218
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,840
I really love that

219
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,840
This is the stuff we dreamed of 10, 15 years ago that you could actually

220
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,840
We're dreaming of it in real time at the time where latency would all be figured out

221
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,840
Of course, we haven't figured out latency for real-time musical collaboration

222
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,840
Since you need to be kind of on the beat and even a couple of milliseconds makes a difference

223
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,840
And we haven't been able to get that working with the freaking USB microphones

224
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,840
Let me see, Peter

225
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,840
Is that Peter?

226
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,840
Yeah, from Ultimate Mix podcast, Peter Long

227
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,840
Peter Long, every ball day

228
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,840
Adam, you said clear channel took over the airways in the US

229
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,840
So the world tuned to podcasting

230
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,840
What's happening now in the free media that's podcasting has to be paid for

231
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,840
Huh?

232
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
Okay, he has a link here

233
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,840
To podcast-audio.crystallist.com

234
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,840
Crystallist is a big owner of radio stations

235
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,840
Particularly in the UK

236
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,840
And they are selling their podcasts

237
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,840
By subscription

238
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,840
So you can get, let's say they do have a free offering

239
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,840
You can get 15 minutes best of podcasts

240
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,840
But for two pounds a month, so five bucks a month

241
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,840
You'll get extended best of additions of your favorite shows

242
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,840
Full length downloads of some programs

243
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,840
Presumably not those with music or only ones that have been cleared as such

244
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,840
Exclusive online only programs, searchable archive of LBC

245
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,840
That's the LBC FM is this offering by the way, I'm sorry

246
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,840
It is a Christmas property

247
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,840
You can get the podcast played that you listen online without downloading

248
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,840
That's a contradiction in terms for full listings of what's on click here

249
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:29,840
So you can sign up it's two pounds 50 for one month, seven pounds for three months and ten pounds for six months

250
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,840
You know what?

251
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,840
That's fine

252
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,840
I'm sure many people will sign up to that

253
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,840
And by the way, if you're going to pay me two pounds a month like five bucks a month

254
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,840
Done

255
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,840
I'll take it

256
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
Absolutely

257
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
I'll give you a commercial free version

258
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,840
You bet you

259
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,840
Maybe that's what we have to do, maybe we just have to

260
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,840
Inundate these podcasts with so much commercial messaging

261
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,840
The people just say screw it, I'd rather pay for it

262
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,840
Let me know what you'd rather do

263
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,840
Geek brief is back, Callie

264
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,840
She had a bandwidth issue

265
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,840
Apparently this video podcast she does is it got really successful

266
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,840
Very, very fast, he's never done any camera work

267
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,840
She's cute, she does this

268
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,840
I just have to say it, she's cute and she talks about gadgets

269
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,840
duh, no wonder it's popular

270
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,840
So you can find that at geekbrief.podshow.com

271
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,840
And we're happy to have her

272
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,840
Suckin' off the pipes here

273
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
As it were

274
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,840
Let's see, we got some stuff about iTunes New Zealand

275
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840
As if that really existed

276
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,840
Hi Adam, just listening to DSC323

277
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,840
And in the spirit of sticking it to the man

278
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,840
I thought I'd share this with you

279
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,840
My name is Gada, and I've recently started the New Zealand podcast

280
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,840
I Heart and Z

281
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,840
With my husband

282
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,840
You can find out more about it at ourheart and Z.com

283
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,840
It's about all things New Zealand for my Canadian perspective

284
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,840
And from his cute perspective

285
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,840
Apple has decided for whatever reason

286
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,840
I can't open up an iTunes music store in New Zealand

287
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,840
I have no problem with this as Apple has enough of my money

288
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,840
In our software company Zodel

289
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
We have two-time exercerers

290
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
Four times parable of laptops

291
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,840
One-eye cloud video, one-eye cloud shop

292
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,840
Thank you

293
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,840
You know what?

294
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,840
I'm just gonna stop for a second

295
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,840
Because I told you that we'd check the times

296
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,840
20 seconds left

297
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,840
And I'm telling you

298
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,840
The clock has already off by four seconds

299
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,840
As we're counting down

300
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,840
I'm comparing castblaster

301
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,840
Which is saying the satellite window closes in two seconds

302
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,840
So goodbye y'all

303
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,840
And now that's 243031-32

304
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,840
My gosh

305
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,840
The countdown clock is actually off

306
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:49,840
I'm just going to presume that castblaster is right on the money with its recording times

307
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,840
So that's kind

308
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,840
That's not good

309
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,840
The only thing you would expect

310
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,840
The countdown clock to absolutely do right is run on time

311
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,840
So man

312
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,840
Oh that's horrible

313
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,840
So what was it like a full four seconds that would that it was off?

314
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,840
This is not good

315
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
This is not good

316
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,840
I got to write back to the guy who wrote it

317
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,840
I don't know how he's doing this timing

318
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,840
But you presume that at least that part would be on

319
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,840
All right

320
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,840
Just us podcasts freaks here

321
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,840
Let me continue with this thing about iTunes and New Zealand

322
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,840
Because that does blow me away that Apple

323
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,840
Has no iTunes store that you can actually use

324
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,840
You know in New Zealand

325
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,840
It's an outrage

326
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,840
Outless other Apple stuff

327
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,840
I was surprised to see that I had to sign into the music store in order to submit my podcast

328
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,840
Of course

329
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,840
This is impossible because I'm sitting in New Zealand with no iTunes store

330
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,840
And no iTunes account

331
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,840
Well, well, well, well, well that is interesting

332
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,840
Of course

333
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,840
I didn't think about that because you can't sign up with a New Zealand based credit card

334
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
That's how they

335
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,840
Segregate your purchases

336
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,840
You know the billing address of your credit card

337
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,840
So I have a Dutch account

338
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,840
And I have a US account

339
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,840
And what you see when you log in is significantly different

340
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,840
You know the top 100 different as well

341
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,840
That's all based by region

342
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,840
Not overall as a global status

343
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,840
And

344
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,840
You need to have an iTunes music store account

345
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,840
To submit your podcast

346
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,840
But of course there's the catch 22

347
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,840
Can't open an account

348
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,840
Can't list your podcast

349
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,840
New Zealand

350
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,840
We are on the way

351
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,840
I decided to email the friendly people at Apple

352
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,840
And this is the response I got

353
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,840
Thank you for your interest in the iTunes music store

354
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,840
At this time customers who reside in New Zealand can use the iTunes music store to browse music

355
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,840
Listen to previews and watch videos

356
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,840
However, purchasing music or submitting podcasts is not yet available in your country

357
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,840
While we cannot comment on future availability of iTunes music store

358
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,840
Please be sure that we are committed to bringing the iTunes music store to music lovers around the world

359
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,840
Since early the iTunes music store team

360
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,840
I couldn't believe that they've knownly turned away free content

361
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,840
Not very community minded if you ask me

362
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,840
I guess that brings me to what I love about DSC

363
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,840
Podsac music network podcast alley

364
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,840
Countless of their shows like The Dawn and Drew Show

365
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,840
Basically it's community

366
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,840
So in the time between deciding to record this and actually recording it

367
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:32,840
I've such data work around and I'm happy to report that iHeart NZ is now listed at iTunes

368
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,840
In the meantime if you're ever looking for a podcast from the land of the Long Want Cloud New Zealand

369
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,840
Remember to keep iHeart NZ in mind

370
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,840
Check us out iHeart NZ.com

371
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,840
Thanks Adam

372
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,840
No, thank you. I appreciate it. Okay

373
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,840
We'll figure out something we can do for New Zealand

374
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,840
I wonder I wonder wonder wonder

375
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,840
Perhaps

376
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,840
Can I do it through my account?

377
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,840
Do you mean you can submit as many podcasts as you want under one account can't you?

378
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,840
So why don't we do it one big clearing account and just start listing all the podcasts for you?

379
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,840
Be happy to set that up

380
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,840
I'm sure there's quite a number of podcasts podcasters that would like to get listed

381
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,840
That would be no problem

382
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,840
I'll look into it if you know by the way

383
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:30,840
Let me know if you can list more than one podcast and of course it's never guaranteed because you know sometimes just don't get listed

384
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,840
It's apparently the way it seems to go

385
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,840
So while we have women talking on the show and thank you very much

386
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,840
I appreciate it

387
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,840
And GB checks it

388
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,840
It's Angie again, you know, I was talking to an indie band about podsiff music network and mentioned

389
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,840
Adam Curry's involvement

390
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,840
And the first thing they thought of is hey, is that that guy with the big hair

391
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,840
So that reminds me that you said you just got in a cool new haircut

392
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,840
But I haven't seen any pictures of it surface online yet, so you're going to put some up

393
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,840
Now to do is buy Dutch gossip magazines Angie

394
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,840
That's where you can see all my cool pictures

395
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,840
Should be hearing today when we're going to court

396
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,840
It should be, you know, this month sometime

397
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,840
I can't go next week because in New York and that does have precedence over this

398
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,840
But it's the same style Angie, it's just a little bit shorter, you know

399
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,840
Nothing, nothing too radical, nothing, nothing too fancy

400
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,840
But if you send me a picture of you, I might consider

401
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,840
Let me see

402
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,840
People really digging the bill album that was available for download

403
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,840
That bill made available

404
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,840
Here's a hotel wins drew, Drew Domkas from the Don and Drew Show

405
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,840
Can I say tail wins since I'm a remote control pilot

406
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,840
He flies RC helicopters

407
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,840
No, no, Drew, of course not

408
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,840
You're not a real man when you fly those

409
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,840
So I think we're going to hook up in San Francisco one of these days

410
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,840
I think they march as something like that

411
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,840
And they're going to do some big, you know, we'll set something up

412
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,840
We'll do a big Don and Drew

413
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,840
Sheen Day against San Francisco

414
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,840
It'll be fun, I'm really looking forward to it, I'll be great

415
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,840
Thought some more feedback on today's show

416
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,840
About four more and then we got another great pod save song

417
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,840
Which is from a very very well known artist who is just joined

418
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,840
The pod save for a revolution

419
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,840
So stay tuned for it

420
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,840
Hey Adam, and data c324

421
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,840
Utah does have my pod show

422
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,840
What allow us to combine multiple subscriptions

423
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,840
Into a single RSS feed

424
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,840
I think that's pretty cool

425
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,840
But is only one half of the ultimate solution

426
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,840
What we also need is an option to manage which episodes have been downloaded

427
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,840
As the pod show end

428
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,840
This would mean I can download episodes first thing in the morning for my commute to work

429
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,840
And then again before I leave work for the commute home

430
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,840
For this to work

431
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,840
I think what is needed is a thin client on the user end

432
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,840
Which knows how to do two things

433
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,840
First how to talk to my pod show

434
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,840
And second what to do with the downloaded episodes

435
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,840
In my case I'd want them sent to my iPod

436
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,840
My iPod would never get duplicate episodes

437
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,840
Because my pod show is the one keeping track of what I've already downloaded

438
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,840
Extending the concept

439
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,840
Such a client could even be run directly from my iPod

440
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,840
Much as share pod does now for copying tracks on and off to any computer I plug it into

441
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,840
Given that such a client would have to operate with my pod show

442
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,840
It would be easy enough for developers to create new clients

443
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,840
To address different platforms i.e. Mac versus Windows

444
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,840
And different devices such as iPod versus iRiver etc

445
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,840
Anyway, that's my ultimate solution

446
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,840
What do you think?

447
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,840
Oh yeah, I almost forgot

448
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,840
Thanks, dude

449
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,840
Yeah, very good idea

450
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,840
I like that a lot

451
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,840
And I know that Kevin and Sue and the whole gang are listening

452
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,840
So I know that they'll take those ideas to hard

453
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,840
You know we've got a lot of great stuff that we can do

454
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,840
When Andrew Grummit came on board

455
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,840
We also acquired gigadile.net

456
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,840
If you haven't checked that out

457
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,840
Definitely look at gigadile

458
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,840
You can create an entire

459
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,840
Podcast feed made up of other

460
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,840
Individual episodes or any piece of audio

461
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,840
Basically so really

462
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,840
Really

463
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,840
You know, puts a whole new metaphor

464
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,840
On to the idea of

465
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,840
Of what a podcast is and how you can create one

466
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,840
Without actually ever recording something yourself

467
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,840
So

468
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,840
Definitely stuff like that in the works

469
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,840
We just want to, you know, the stuff that we have now

470
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,840
We just want to get out get it into bait

471
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,840
Already so people can start playing around with it

472
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,840
And start breaking it

473
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,840
I'm doing a fine job by the way of breaking most of that

474
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,840
Okay, let me see Nick Jaffey has a few words as well

475
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
Let's see what he's got going on

476
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,840
Hey Adam, this is the podson from the zoo

477
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,840
Of course, and I just want to say a little

478
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,840
Feedback thing on my podshow

479
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,840
Why don't you have, as it mostly is woven together

480
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,840
Why don't you have the PMN

481
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,840
Linking up with your show notes

482
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,840
So whenever you play a song

483
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,840
It would write the song

484
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,840
And maybe the

485
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,840
The creators link

486
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,840
In the show notes or something like that

487
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,840
Because then of course, that would link up with the

488
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,840
Royalty thing for

489
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,840
The podcast is referring to you

490
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,840
If they click on the show notes link

491
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,840
It's really complicated but it could work

492
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,840
It's going to of course work with other things like

493
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,840
Promise etc

494
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,840
Do you see listeners please check out my website

495
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,840
Zov.com

496
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,840
Absolutely

497
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,840
Yeah, so of course we'd love to have that automated

498
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,840
Which would just be fantastic

499
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,840
We have a module now for your show sites

500
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,840
That you'll see on your

501
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,840
When you're able to sign up for the podcast delivery network

502
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,840
And you can actually have that display

503
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,840
The last five songs you played

504
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,840
From the pod save music network

505
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,840
The next obvious step is to have that

506
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,840
You know just kind of magically appear

507
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,840
Here's the songs in this in this episode

508
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,840
I don't take a little bit more work

509
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,840
But I have faith in George the Russian scientists

510
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,840
Hey Adam

We're enjoying Valentine's Day

515
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,840

Bye bye

528
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
I love that Karen is hung in there so long

529
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,840
What is this now over a year that she's been doing

530
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,840
Karen think it's Karen's

531
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,840
God in steam scene

532
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,840
It's a tongue twister

533
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,840
Cadence themed song podcast

534
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,840
It's usually shows up in my

00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,840
In my iTunes actually is where I'm subscribed to

536
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,840
It usually shows up on Sunday

537
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,840
And I just love playing the songs

538
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,840
You know nice and loud throughout the whole house

539
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,840

Very nice

542
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,840
I'll think about it

543
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,840
I'll come up with something since I'm not going to be home for

544
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,840
Shiza and be in New York

545
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,840
If you haven't checked them out yet

546
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,840
I know I've talked about it

547
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,840
There's a

548
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,840
Oh my gosh

549
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,840
There's a podcast you might want to check out

550
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,840
It's

551
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,840
Heather and Johnnell

552
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,840
And basically their entire show

553
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,840
Just to enable them to podcast

554
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,840
I'll give you a step in

555
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,840
And so they're sponsoring that show

556
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,840
And it's a Christina's listen to it a couple of times actually

557
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,840
It's for you know like a teen teenage girls 15 to

558
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,840
I'd say easily 19 because you know

559
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,840
You're never too old to talk about guys I guess

560
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
I have limited listening experience with the show

561
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,840
But you can check it out at download.aciveyou.com

562
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,840
And here's something very mysterious

563
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,840
Something fresh is coming

564
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,840
You

565
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,840
You

566
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,840
It's all about a brand new network

567
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,840
Sure everyone in their pod father has a network

568
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,840
But this one is different

569
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,840
This one is fresh

570
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,840
Fresh media works but you

571
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
The podcast are in charge

572
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
Go to freshmediaworks.com to sign up for more information

573
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,840
Fresh media works

574
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,840
We're reinventing media together

575
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:32,840
Fresh media works.com

576
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,840
You're almost swear young palette did that

577
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,840
Not quite sure what it is

578
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,840
But lots of people are excited about freshmediaworks.com

579
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,840
Kind of a drab website right for right now

580
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,840
But apparently something cool going on

581
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,840
So keep my eye on it for you

582
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,840
Two more things

583
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:58,840
Okay, Alex Ross is an ex English professor

584
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,840
And I want to correct me on the use of my language

585
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,840
The English language

586
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,840
Alex says you frequently use the term prolific when

587
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,840
Thank you me profound

588
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,840
Whether it be about something your father or

589
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,840
Mad Weinstein said and by the way they often say the same thing

590
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,840
The same profound things

591
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,840
I noticed you tend to transpose the words

592
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,840
prolific denotes quantity length and number

593
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,840
The amount of podcasts you've created is therefore prolific

594
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,840
Your music library may be prolific

595
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,840
The Rolling Stones or Charles Bukowski are prolific

596
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,840
But people don't make prolific statements

597
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,840
They make profound ones

598
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,840
Thank you very much Alex. I appreciate that

599
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,840
Yeah, I know I get that messed up

600
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,840
And there's also profound and profane

601
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,840
I'll know and that's probably why I get freaked out about it

602
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,840
And neither use profound or profane just use prolific

603
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,840
Seems like it's easier

604
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,840
A safer bet every time

605
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,840
Because I remember one time in college

606
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,840
For all three months that I was there

607
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,840
I meant to say profound but I said profane and

608
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,840
The professor freaked out on me

609
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,840
I don't remember exactly what the context was

610
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,840
But I remember don't want to get those messed up anymore

611
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,840
Hey Adam greetings from Jerusalem

612
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,840
I'm a BBC journalist and have sent

613
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,840
The last few spent the last few days in the West Bank covering the Palestinian elections

614
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,840
I've just uploaded a post-election podcast

615
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,840
And ipodcast.lipsin.com

616
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,840
That's Bravo November India podcast

617
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,840
All-one word.lipsin.com

618
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,840
Is this the first spot news podcast recorded on the ground

619
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,840
From a developing story in the Middle East

620
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,840
Kind regards from Stewart

621
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,840
I don't know if it's the first I certainly love it

622
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,840
I don't know if you're a freelancer Stewart

623
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,840
Or what the deal is

624
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,840
But I'm subscribed to your feed

625
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,840
That's fantastic. I really enjoyed this stuff

626
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,840
I could hear people around you

627
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,840
You know and even though it's

628
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,840
Some of it was very similar to what you might see on CNN on the BBC world news

629
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,840
It had a whole different vibe to it really really enjoyed it

630
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,840
So keep it rocking

631
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,840
And then finally

632
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,840
I told you I told you something like this was going to happen

633
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,840
The Dutch Ask Cap BMI the Buma

634
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,840
Who are responsible for collecting fees from

635
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,840
Basically any performance

636
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,840
So if you have a radio on in the workplace or if you have a restaurant or a bar

637
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,840
If you have a restaurant or a bar

638
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,840
Now there's a

639
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,840
An organization

640
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,840
The Dutch Hotel and restaurant organization

641
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,840
And they had set up hospitality music.nl

642
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,840
Which you probably can't get to

643
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,840
If you're trying it right now in front of your computer

644
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,840
The reason what they've done is they put up

645
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,840
What they considered to be pod safe music

646
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,840
They don't call it pod safe

647
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,840
But they call royalty free music

648
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,840
That all these restaurants

649
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,840
Were happily downloading and playing because they felt that the

650
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,840
The Buma fees were just too high

651
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,840
And they were cutting in too much into their profit margin

652
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,840
Now

653
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,840
The Buma says

654
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,840
That they have the right to collect from every

655
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,840
Place of business

656
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,840
Regardless of whether you're playing all royalty free music

657
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,840
Or not in fact they'd even clubs they'd do it by CD player

658
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,840
And furthermore they

659
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,840
I guess they served an injunction against the site

660
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,840
Because they said there were some infringements of copyright

661
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,840
So the site is currently down

662
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,840
But wow

663
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,840
That's messed up

664
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,840
This is exactly what I predicted

665
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,840
They're basically saying

666
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,840
We have the right to collect

667
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,840
Money from you whether you're using

668
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,840
Our music or not

669
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,840
And I think that

670
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,840
Definitely

671
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,840
They're trying to protect their turf here

672
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,840
And this is something that someone should take all the way

673
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,840
I'm not going to spend any time

674
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,840
Any more time that I have to

675
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,840
Helping out Dutch causes

676
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,840
Certainly not when it comes to

677
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,840
Stuff with the government and

678
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,840
Going for the

679
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,840
For the justice of it all

680
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,840
Because I don't think I owe

681
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,840
The country that

682
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,840
I would certainly do it in the states

683
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,840
But come on

684
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,840
This is this is messed up

685
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,840
And I think you should be able to play

686
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,840
Completely royalty free music without having to pay for anything

687
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,840
Or maybe you can choose to pay a different organization

688
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,840
If there's a different kind of deal

689
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,840
That should be a competitive thing

690
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,840
And it's not

691
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,840
The Buma says they have the

692
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,840
God-given right almost

693
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,840
The legal right to be the only ones who collect those types of fees

694
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,840
And they're going after them

695
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,840
Whether their music is being used or not

696
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,840
And these establishments

697
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,840
So I'd say that's pretty messed up

698
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,840
Meanwhile on the pod safe music scene

699
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,840
Things are going very well

700
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,840
We have

701
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,840
A major major artists sign up

702
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,840
And has dropped three songs onto the PMN

703
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,840
And one of those is titled Ever since

704
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,840
I'm going to play it right now

705
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,840
This is Leslie Gour

706
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:10,840
I dreamt you

707
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,840
I drew you

708
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:20,840
Long before I thought that I might never find you

709
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,840
I chased you

710
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,840
I traced you

711
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,840
And held your picture up

712
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,840
Into the light

713
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,840
All the way to light

714
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,840
Today is too long to miss

715
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,840
All the parties I've been to

716
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,840
You were missed

717
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,840
I've waited ever since

718
00:42:54,840 --> 00:43:02,840
I met you

719
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,840
I met you

720
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,840
I tried to forget you

721
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,840
You know I felt somehow

722
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,840
Someone had sent you

723
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,840
To me

724
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,840
And as if you knew me

725
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,840
We picked up where we left off

726
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,840
In another life

727
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,840
The times I tried to settle out

728
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,840
For so much less than this one

729
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,840
I'll say it all

730
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,840
But all in every

731
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,840
I left

732
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,840
I waited ever since

733
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,840
I met you

734
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:56,840
I waited ever since

735
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:24,840
I met you

736
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,840
All the way to light

737
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,840
Today is too long to miss

738
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,840
All parties I've been to

739
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,840
You were missed

740
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,840
I waited ever since

741
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,840
I met you

742
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,840
I waited ever since

743
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,840
I waited ever since

744
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,840
I waited ever since

745
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:04,840
I met you

746
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,840
Ever since

747
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,840
From

748
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,840
Leslie Gore

749
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,840
First album of new material

750
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,840
In 30 years

751
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,840
And of course it's her own

752
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,840
Project role in label

753
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,840
So she owns it

754
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,840
She wouldn't be saying you don't own me

755
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,840
Well actually she does say you don't own me screw it

756
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,840
Nobody owns her

757
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,840
Welcome

758
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,840
Fantastic that she looks great

759
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,840
Great to have you in the pod save music scene

760
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,840
I'm sure lots of pod castes will pick up

761
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,840
And it's great to see that there's even a

762
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,840
Remake if you don't own me that she's

763
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,840
She's also made available

764
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,840
Fantastic

765
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,840
All right

766
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,840
Full new week of shows

767
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,840
Coming your way

768
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,840
I think Thursday will be the day I'm going to the

769
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,840
Netherlands the win command to just told me he would

770
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,840
He would happily arrange the moony

771
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,840
For me since Delta Sierra is still in pieces

772
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,840
But there will definitely be a show

773
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,840
Then I'll just upload it from the hotel

774
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,840
