Delta Sierra Charley, $407.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Transmidders?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We don't need no sticky ingredients, you know?

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I like to think I'm flying into this genre.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Fantastic!

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Isn't that a curry?

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hey Adam, these days can go and look their line and I just want to bake.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Woo! Woo! Woo!

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's all I got.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
For the ever-worked day.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Another day, another show to do.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Another home-to-roofed trash.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Another fist-by-fits-and-guys from the crowd sound.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
They're back to the museum.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
A quick group is sex.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And they all sound like fun.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But I'm fighting on back there, tears.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Please say me from this rock and roll-off style.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah, rock and roll-off style.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Everybody off the bottom to the sun comes up.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Step on me, I'll go home and jubbs.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Pretty girls tell me why the genius I am.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But they don't even know me.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
They only want to blow me out, I let them.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But it's just to be perfect.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Please say me from this rock and roll-off style.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yeah, rock and roll-off style.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You average people however you live.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I wish I had a mortgage kids ever-wive.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I wish I would from another farm on my pay.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And get some more and just work it too.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Why won't you do?

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You kids are an African, don't eat enough.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You don't realize that I'm the one to get it tough.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sure you're dying from famine and disease.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But it's just to be perfect.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I wish I would from another farm on my pay.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Please say me from this rock and roll-off style.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah, rock and roll-off style.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I wish I would from another farm on my pay.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Please say me from this rock and roll-off style.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah, rock and roll-off style.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah, the modern day of the rock and roll-off style.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I need to...

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hey, it's...

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Where those guys?

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
They're from Australia, down under.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Man bites God.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thank you so much Brian from the procrastic cast.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We're turning me on to that.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You can find them at the Podsate Music Network.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hey, everybody.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
How you doing?

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Welcome to the Daily Source Code.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You can tell by the crackling of the microphone

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
that you're receiving the correct podcast.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Another beautiful day in San Francisco.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's early on Tuesday morning.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And I can see all the way to the hills in front of me

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and to the left I can see...

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I can even see the other...

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Can I see Oakland?

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah, I think so.

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I can see all across the bay.

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's beautiful.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And it's going to be warm already.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The temperatures cranking up.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I miss my girls.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I want to go.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah, I miss Christina.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Of course.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't know if she misses me as much.

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You know, 15, 16 year olds.

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
They got their own thing going on.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I really miss Patricia.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And I'm not just...

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Because I miss her.

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I miss her on the show, man.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Dang.

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You guys got to be a listener by now.

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And the time zone stuff is just no way.

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It doesn't work out.

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We can't...

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We can't coordinate it so that we can actually do a show together.

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And it probably wouldn't be the same if we can't look at each other while we're talking.

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And the delay of Skype or I chat or whatever.

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And it had some weird stuff going on.

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh, you'll love this.

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I had...

98
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Well, you know, I have the Toshiba.

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You know, I'm still on...

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm still on Windows.

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Although I did take my power book to be a service yesterday.

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So hopefully that'll get fixed very soon.

103
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, what's flashing at me here?

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Google Calendar.

105
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Why are you flashing?

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't know.

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's incorrect.

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's still set on UK time.

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay.

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So I have the Toshiba.

111
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And I have a great monitor on my desk at the office here in San Francisco.

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Pot show HQ.

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And so I love...

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Hooking it up.

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You know, I...

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Having an external monitor is fantastic for the extended desktop.

117
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That's really what I love.

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You know, so you just move them out to the left and it keeps on going.

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And this is something Max do as well.

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I know.

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But here's something a little...

122
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Some interesting little quirk.

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yesterday, I was showing Ron some stuff.

124
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And doing that on Cas Blaster, showing how...

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Because, you know, he...

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I think he had a...

127
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He just switched to a new computer.

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So he has to reinstall everything.

129
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And Cas Blaster now has this functionality.

130
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Where after you're done recording the show,

131
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
you basically just say,

132
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You had to take it away.

133
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And then it uploads everything to the podcast,

134
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
delivery networks.

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So no more, you know,

136
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
saving out FTPing passwords.

137
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You know, everything is all done at one go.

138
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's just really nice.

139
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
One button is done.

140
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But I showed that to him on the secondary monitor.

141
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And then when I fired up Cas Blaster this morning,

142
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm like,

143
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I can't see it.

144
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Where's Cas Blaster?

145
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And it was in virtual space.

146
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
In the most programs when you set the...

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
When you set the computer back to...

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
To singular monitor, it kind of knows.

149
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But Cas Blaster is super dude.

150
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It was hijed up way in space.

151
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And I had to figure out,

152
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I had to set it back to extended desktop.

153
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I know if you've ever gone through this.

154
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This is really funny.

155
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Because I don't have a monitor here.

156
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Otherwise, it would have hooked it up.

157
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And I would have dragged it right over to the laptop monitor.

158
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So I had to start class Blaster,

159
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
move the mouse to the left,

160
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
into invisible space.

161
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And then just click until I finally hit...

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I hit the metro sexual moment,

163
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
which I know is F5.

164
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's the top of the middle row.

165
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So then I just estimated moving up.

166
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And I was able to grab the toolboard.

167
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And drag it back.

168
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It was quite an operation I tell you.

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I was like, oh man, don't do it.

170
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Go to the office and hook this thing up to a monitor.

171
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Anyway.

172
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Another thing I miss.

173
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Be real honest with you.

174
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's the Senseo.

175
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Now, I try not to drink any coffee while I'm here at the condo.

176
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
At the office, I drink tons of it.

177
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But I figure it's also kind of good for my system.

178
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Just to be drinkin' tea or something else.

179
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I try to...

180
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You know, mash it up a little bit.

181
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And I saw a comment from...

182
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Who is this from?

183
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
How come that's unsigned?

184
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It was funny because it was...

185
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh, here it is.

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Chris from ChrisGaredMedia.com.

187
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
After being compelled to buy myself a Senseo after hearing you talk about it so much,

188
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I've been experimenting a lot recently trying to expand the options.

189
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Now check this out Senseo lovers.

190
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
My favorite at the moment is melting white chocolate and mixing it with some freshly

191
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
brewed, resulting in a nice white chocolate mocha.

192
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Something else I'd like to do is brew up some senseo.

193
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Let it chill.

194
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Use the blender to mix it with a lot of ice, cocoa and cream.

195
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Which gives you a nice mocha frape.

196
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Just a little something you might want to try.

197
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Seems it's only like four different options for the pods.

198
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Actually, there's a whole bunch of different pods.

199
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And you can get tea pods and pods to make yourself.

200
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And it's just a wonderful, wonderful.

201
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, gosh.

202
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I don't know.

203
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I do miss it.

204
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Oh, I love us.

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I don't know if you've been following Roger smalls on his on his web log.

206
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But Roger has gone from my one time stalker.

207
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And I say that would love Roger to...

208
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,280
to, uh, he's a multimedia powerhouse. Uh, so we, I played you a bit, and I didn't play the

209
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,880
bit, but I told you that he, uh, is doing little segments for the BBC. BBC's one click, I think.

210
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:39,960
And, uh, if I'm not mistaken, Nokia gave him a new phone. Nokia gave him a new phone,

211
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,360
to do all his podcasting with. Hello, I didn't wrote your hair, just because of the

212
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,640
question for your message. So, moment, um, we're feeling very tired at the moment, and I'm just

213
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,240
wondering if it is normal or not. So, I'm going to work every day, uh, coming back, uh, downloading

214
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,440
some podcasting your house, uh, maybe having a meow, listening to your show, have a little

215
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:09,640
fiddle, uh, but then after that, I feel just like falling asleep, and I was wondering, is this, uh, normal,

216
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,080
I've been unsure if it's the weather or not, but I'm feeling very sleepy and very tired, uh, and

217
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,400
I'm not really getting anything done in anything, then anymore. I probably wasted about two

218
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:25,400
hours in the evening, uh, asleep on the sofa, and now you mention you got the same sort of problem,

219
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,840
but that's probably due to old age and drugs, uh, I've been matching you, running around the house,

220
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:37,160
not wearing very much, uh, be like a blonde dog, he was born, shaking away, shouting, uh,

221
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,600
Christina, and then falling asleep on the sofa. So, thank you to your listeners, I've got any

222
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:51,080
tips about staying awake, maybe in Cogesci, uh, he's quite old, uh, advice is both on half to stay awake,

223
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,720
and that'll be nice. Anyway, that's all I have to say, so bye for now.

224
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,680
Uh, you got, you had to be careful what you call Uncle Jessie there, although of course,

225
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,760
he is the satellite repairman, and he can fix anything, and he, well, you know what, the song says

226
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:12,360
all, does it? Hopefully he'll be able to help you out there, Roger, with your sleep

227
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,680
deprivation issues with satellite repairman coming after he, well, satellite repairman,

228
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,640
what's he gonna do, he'll fit your misconceptions and answer questions to,

229
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:30,680
earn nothing in the universe, and he can't be for you, satellite repairman, well,

230
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:37,480
satellite repairman, here you go, thank you very much, Roger.

231
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,560
Good to hear you again, my friend, and the quality of your phone just sounds fantastic.

232
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,920
For those of you who are brand new to the daily source code, and seems that we're getting more

233
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:06,040
listeners every single day. I have a Mercedes station wagon, it's a 300 turbo diesel

234
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,240
from the year 1984, it is Eggnog Yellow, currently in the shop because she dropped her

235
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,080
training on a 45 degree incline, but worth the, oh, by the way, it's not 1800 bucks, turns out they

236
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:23,480
did the bait and switch on me, it's like $3,200, but well worth it, she's being repaired, hopefully,

237
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,360
today or tomorrow will be getting her back up. This is the segment we talk about, the most important

238
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:35,960
thing, she runs on biodiesel, vegetable oil, kind of, and uh, well, I love her very much,

239
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:42,760
anyway, so we have this little segment called the Trinity bit, where people send in cool information

240
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,280
about alternative fuels and, and about biodiesel in particular, and of course, anything else that

241
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:54,360
to kind of fits, I got an email here from, uh, was this problem was really nice,

242
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,840
from Chris, and that wasn't an email, was that it wasn't an email from Chris fame,

243
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:08,280
finger who heard me crying about Trinity on a daily source code episode 405 and found a whole

244
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:16,760
bunch of spare parts on eBay, really appreciated. Somehow I get a very, very clouded view of the

245
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,160
ordering parts off of eBay, and then perhaps even implementing those myself in the Trinity,

246
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,560
something I missed though, which I should have played for you on Friday, was really exciting for,

247
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,080
well, not necessarily the biodiesel world, but for the diesel world in general, and I'm telling

248
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,920
you these diesel engines, you're going to see a lot more people drive in deals, because it's going

249
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,720
to be cheaper, and because you can throw biodiesel in there, and when you throw biodiesel in,

250
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,320
it's much cleaner, smells, much nicer, and you can even make this stuff at home. So I want to play

251
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,920
this piece of feedback that fits right here in Trinity, which I should have done on Friday,

252
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,760
but it's very exciting news, check this out. Adam, hi, my name is Chris. I don't have a podcast to

253
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:00,040
promote for you right now, but I do know of an event that you may find interesting, knowing that

254
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:07,080
you and some of your listeners are interested in cars and diesel. This weekend is the 24-hour of

255
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:14,920
Luma endurance race. Now this race is perceived as the most prestigious endurance race of all

256
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:22,040
motorsport, and particularly of interest this year is Audi. They are fielding two cars that will be

257
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,880
diesel powered, and earlier this year I saw these cars in Seabring, Florida, one of the cars

258
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:34,520
won that race and became the first diesel powered car to win in international competition. These cars

259
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:41,480
are amazing, they're incredibly fast, and if they don't break down like other diesel powered

260
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,880
models, if they don't break down, I'm sure they're going to be right at the front of the field.

261
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,680
So in between matches of the World Cup, I recommend looking through your local programs and seeing

262
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,600
if you have coverage. I know in the States the Speed TV channel will be starting coverage at 10 a.m.

263
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:04,040
on Saturday, Eastern Time, and we'll have coverage going on throughout the day, and yeah, give it a try.

264
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,560
Dude, I really appreciate you sending me that, of course, over the weekend, I was doing anything

265
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:15,000
but looking at the 24-hour of Lumaan, and I hadn't actually heard your comment until the

266
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,800
this morning in bed while I was prepping for the show, but guess what? The car actually won.

267
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,680
A diesel car won Lumaan, the 24-hour endurance race of Lumaan.

268
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:31,560
Now I wonder what was the fuel mixture? And those of you out there who know all about it,

269
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,920
could we actually pull the same thing off using biodiesel, would it make a difference? Apparently

270
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,480
the vegetable oil does a lot better in your engine is better for your engine. Could it happen?

271
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,880
Let me know. And we'll talk about it in a future episode of Trinity.

272
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,760
Got voicemail numbers for you to call if you have any feedback while you're driving around or

273
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,640
walk in the dog or whatever you're doing. Just put it in your phone right now. You don't have

274
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,840
to call immediately, put it in the phone. So if you're on a mobile, you want to do the plus.

275
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,560
A lot of people still don't know that, by the way, that on mobile phones, if you travel

276
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,120
outside of the US, or if you travel outside of the country of your choice, you know, we have to

277
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,680
die so in the US you have to dial 011 and then the country code and then the area code and then the

278
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:34,280
number. If you put a plus in and then the country code, so in the US it would be plus 1 and then you

279
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:40,760
put in 206256357. No matter where you are, you'll never have to dial the access code again.

280
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,040
And you'll get through to the voicemail box. It's a standard greeting, so it's not like,

281
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,640
hey, it's Adam, leave a message. Could I still haven't figured out how to do that on the

282
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:58,040
was it J fax, J2 or something like that that I'm using? Excuse me. Oh, senseio. And this senseio

283
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:06,040
moment brought to you by Geek Brief TV. Kelly Lewis, looking real good. Where was I?

284
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,680
Yeah, that was I saying. I'll get about it. Oh, yes, the London number. That's it.

285
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,480
In London. So you can choose whichever number you want to call. It's the same voice mailbox.

286
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:28,520
O2O. 760 actually. So it would be plus 4407076813753. Hey, Adam, this is Troy from Rutgers Ramlings.

287
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:34,840
I just had a question. I actually listened to the Charlie at work, but download it via iTunes on

288
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,280
well, my home computer. And I was wondering if I go back through those shows when you were doing

289
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:47,400
the golden tickets and find one or two or however many are there are still redeemable. I know

290
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,920
that's wishful thinking, but I was just wondering that because I'm going back through

291
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,280
all the old podcasts and trying to listen to them on the computer. So just wondering if those

292
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:03,240
were still valid or if they expire or what to deal. Thanks, Adam. Bye. Okay, so a little talk about

293
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,920
the golden tickets and I think you're going to see us doing some more golden tickets very soon with

294
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:14,840
wonderful cash prizes. The way it works is the ticket is actually inserted when you download the

295
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:22,280
podcast. So if you were to do it today and you were to download even in an old episode,

296
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,760
you would not get a golden ticket because they've all been issued. However, if you use iTunes,

297
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:33,560
as you said, and the show has already been downloaded, then you have just as much chances

298
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,440
anyone else. And of course, of course, those tickets are redeemable. You probably subscribe to the

299
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:46,760
DevCast. It's a DevCast, DEV, Delta Echo, Victor, Charlie, Elvis, Sierra, Tango, dot pod show.com.

300
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,320
That's where I geek out with the boys and girls from the office, talk about actually we got a

301
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,880
developer we had on the show. Andrew and I talked to a DevCast number six. So we handed out I think

302
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,440
two with 300, several hundred golden tickets. We actually talked about it on the most recent episode.

303
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:12,280
So yeah, if you downloaded it, when the show was released and we said an X number of tickets

304
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,680
and after the all the tickets are issued, every download after that, of course, doesn't contain

305
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,760
a golden ticket. Now we're going to have so much fun with this when everything releases pod show

306
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:26,920
plus and which is coming soon and to prove it, to prove this my friends, how quick this is coming.

307
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:36,040
I have made a solemn vow to myself. And the vow was to you as well because you are the listeners

308
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,560
and we're building this for you. Yeah, there's the podcast, the LiBri Network, of course,

309
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,400
which is really what we started out with, but pod show plus when you see how we've put the

310
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:52,920
my collection together, the channel guide, I know you're going to love it. All the feedback has been

311
00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:01,080
really, really positive. I'm going to keep my facial hair, let it grow until we actually release.

312
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:07,400
So we can track the progress of how long it takes. Now, actually, I have not shaved in

313
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:16,840
when did I stop shaving Thursday? Yeah, Thursday. So I'm getting pretty ragged and I guess what

314
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:25,320
I'll do is I'll, I guess I'll have to take some pictures so you can stay current with the, with the, with the

315
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:34,280
timeline. You know, I have gray hair on my pierce. It's disgusting. Hey, Adam, greetings from Sunny Florida.

316
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,320
This is Chuck Palm from the website cleverly named the same at Chuck Palm.com. And I got a bone to pick

317
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,160
with you. Last week on the Charlie episode 403, you stole my show, man. You see, I've only just

318
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,400
started podcasting and I teamed up with this commercial studio so we can produce some shows

319
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:56,440
for clients at ESPpodcasting.com, shameless plug. But now I got a serious credibility problem.

320
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,840
You see, on Chuck Palm.com, my personal audio blog, I had my second show ever, and I spoke about

321
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:09,080
school full leaving Microsoft and the German Chancellor's new podcast, the Iranians that lost

322
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:15,000
to Mexico in the World Cup. And then I do this like little tribute to you, the podfather, man.

323
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,600
I did that and the only problem was it was the exact same topics of your show that day.

324
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,080
So now what am I going to do? No one's going to believe me that I posted my show like 8 hours

325
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:31,080
before you did and you basically stole my content. Seriously, though, man, I was actually kind of

326
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,040
honored that you chose some of the same topics that I did for your show on the same day.

327
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,920
It was cool to hear you talk about it even if it was 8 hours after I posted my content on the

328
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:46,200
East Coast. Oh, and the thing about the Welsh accent, you did it so well that I couldn't

329
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,840
understand you the first times you did the bit about being the only gay in the village. I've

330
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:56,280
been to London and we don't get your version of Big Brother here, but I thought you were saying

331
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:02,120
the only get in the village. Personally, I think that was funny here anyway. But much respect to you,

332
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:07,320
man. I was old enough to remember you on MTV and you still need a haircut. You need to wash your hands.

333
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,120
Thank you. Keep the Charlie Crank and man. Happy father's day to you.

334
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,640
I buddy, appreciate it. Yeah, like the two and two. That's kind of cool.

335
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,560
Is that pod safe? I'd like to hear the whole song, actually. Don't worry about it, man.

336
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,240
You're not ripping anything off. I don't think. It doesn't, I don't matter.

337
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,720
It's cool. Brilliant minds think alike. Let's just leave it at that show.

338
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,120
What are we doing on time? We can, we have time for this one.

339
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:34,120
Check this out. Hey Adam. I was just listening to Charlie 403. This is actually the second time

340
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:40,920
I've spoken with you. I called you a long time ago when you worked for that one TV network

341
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:46,360
that used to play a lot of music videos. But now all it plays is like reality shows

342
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,000
of kids cranking their high school. Yeah. And you two should wash your hands, my friend.

343
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,840
I think you know what's network I'm talking about. You were thinking video requests.

344
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,680
And I talked about this yesterday. That was dial MTV, the predecessor to total TRL,

345
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:07,640
total request live. And the original Carson daily. And I requested the song cold blood.

346
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:13,480
I can't. And I don't know if you remember that. But yeah, I didn't play it. Of course not.

347
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,840
This is so funny. Of course not because it was all programmed. See, you actually think that you had

348
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,320
some influence over that show. No way, dude. It was always the same. The only thing that would

349
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,440
change once and a while would be the number one or number two video, which is probably the

350
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:32,440
same way it is with TRL these days. We didn't actually take your request into regard. It was just

351
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,920
using it as content. You know? So I felt silly for requesting it. And number two,

352
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:44,920
I videotaped it. So I actually have a videotaped of you talking to me with it says my name at

353
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:50,440
the bottom of the screen. So I wonder if you remember that kick skull blood. I do remember. No, I do.

354
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:57,480
My brush with fame. Because we never play. I want to tell you, I heard of your show on Dom3. So

355
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:05,160
thanks to them. And I wanted to tell you that a wife eater to be a proper wife eater needs to

356
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:12,440
have a goody can and your stains on it. But this is the sleeveless T-shirt that I call wife

357
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,840
eater, which some people take incredible offense to. You're right. If it, I don't have spaghetti stains,

358
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:22,520
but I got like T and I got burn holes does that count. Anyway, I wanted to tell you that

359
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:29,880
with your current windows, mac and touch problems. I think that you should stick with the PC hardware,

360
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:38,120
but try not to try it. Just try it. It's Linux. Not big five point 0.1 just came out. And I think

361
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:44,040
you'll find that the seal is much more of what you're looking for than that cheap windows ceiling.

362
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:49,080
But try it out. Keep doing what you're doing. I love you. I love you, show.

363
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:55,640
I love you too. Just wanted to say, what is all this Welsh shape? Do you want to get into

364
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:01,960
the village? Is obviously to make and not? I'm definitely right. I am the only gain of

365
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,160
it as you see. It's from Little Britain, not from Big Brother, by the way, for the previous caller.

366
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:14,520
Yeah, not big. So let me talk about that in a second. First of all, our friends listening to us

367
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,240
on serious stars 102. We got some great stuff coming up for you today in our four hour lineup.

368
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:26,600
We've got the two for Tuesday. P-dub sets up new up, which means our last two shows between

369
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:32,360
nine and ten this evening will be the squad cast and no idle threats to fantastic podcasts.

370
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,840
Both members of the Podshow podcast network. We're shaken up a bit on this series.

371
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,880
So you'll be hearing new sounds as we move forward. And I'll be back tomorrow for the Wednesday

372
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,640
edition of the Charlie right here on stars 102. Thanks for listening everybody.

373
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:55,480
Now, about that caller who was talking about topics, I think I spend at least 10 minutes trying

374
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:03,080
to find topics. Turns out you spell it with a K. K-N-O-P-P-I-X. Very interesting. There's this new

375
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,960
of course, at this point, if I can switch to Windows that easily, I should be able to switch

376
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:17,080
to almost any operating system and be completely happy. Part for the fact that cast blaster won't

377
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:22,120
run under Linux, which becomes a huge problem for me. So there's no switch imminent there.

378
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,600
But very interesting topics. This is new. I guess it's live Linux live or something, which means

379
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:35,080
you can basically load the whole operating system on one CD or excuse me. Oh man, a double shot

380
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:40,520
of Sensei, a moment brought to you by Donna Drew. And done them yet.

381
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,320
So you can load it onto a USB memory stick. You know, basically take your operating system with you

382
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:53,240
and it'll load on any machine. Of course, except for any machine like the Shiba Portage

383
00:25:53,240 --> 00:26:00,280
which happens to use a USB connected CD drive. That seems impossible. I like the screen shots,

384
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:07,000
though, those look pretty cool. And I'm not afraid of trying to try not new stuff. And I'm still

385
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,640
vibing on it. It's okay. It totally is. You know, I think I'm going to get a new PC though because

386
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,880
this one is missing a few bits. It doesn't have the mobile yet. It has the Pentium M. So it's

387
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:26,120
the mobile processor, which is a little bit weaker. And so Ron recently got a new Sony Vio.

388
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,800
I think I'm going to try out one of those. We're just bumping around trying some stuff out.

389
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:35,000
You'll be along for the ride as we test more stuff. Give you my experiences.

390
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:42,200
And I also along with the letting the beard grow, I vow to give you some screenshots of my

391
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:47,160
desktop. See how I've configured it to kind of give me the best of both worlds. It's almost

392
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:54,520
like a like a transsexual sound. I've got here. Hey, soccer. Let's talk about that, huh?

393
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,880
Hi Adam. This is Franco, or Castitalia, or Italian minister of podcasting. Yes, not just that, but

394
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,720
my Italian friend. I know I'm a little late for this, but I heard some of the comments of

395
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,160
your listeners about the match between our countries at the soccer world championships. I really don't

396
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:18,920
think that USA team got spanked so badly. It was a very rough game. It was balanced. Every team had

397
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:25,480
their opportunities, but at the end, I think the result is fair. So I hope our countries will

398
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,560
meet again along the tournament, maybe in the finals, huh? And it was really a honor playing with

399
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:37,400
you guys. No. Ciao de l'Italia. Pronto, ciao ciao. It was actually it was totally our pleasure.

400
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:42,440
And it was, you know, I kind of forgot to mention that, but I have to say that I really enjoyed

401
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:49,480
both sides. Everyone played a kick-ass game. And what I found kind of interesting is

402
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,440
not the Italian guys. You know, they're all good looking. But we got a lot of US players who

403
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,480
were pretty good. In fact, they look like they could have been on the Italian team. And I do hope

404
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,880
that we meet in the finals. You never know. I think this is a great year for soccer, for football.

405
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:13,000
Like, what should we have to call it soccer? I guess we have to. I'm just going to keep saying

406
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,520
football. You'll know what I mean. Unless it's the Super Bowl. Because that's the only time

407
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,680
to talk about American football, probably. It'd be great if we would meet up in the finals. I think

408
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,400
well, I'm still, all my teams are still up in the air. England, of course,

409
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,560
will be going on to the next round. US, I guess, they have to be to Ghana. Is it

410
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,200
there to be Ghana? And the Netherlands, of course, still in the game. So I've got three teams

411
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,720
that I'm rooting for. And my boys are keeping me up to speed with what's going on with the rest

412
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,200
of the world cup this week. Hey, Adam, this is Phil. It's Tony. And we are the soccer show

413
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:52,600
podcast available at soccershout.com. Just a quick wrap up of the end of the second round of group

414
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:58,520
games. Who was looking good so far? Tony, I reckon our container in Holland are in the

415
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:03,480
Paul positions in terms of performances so far. Yeah, you can't really look past ours in

416
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,360
Tina's performance in the second round. Six goals. No one else has come close to that.

417
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,280
And Holland is doing really well. They're scrapping out results a bit more, but looking

418
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,360
classy in the process. I think Spain and Portugal to a lesser extent are also

419
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:21,320
equating themselves quite nicely. I think in the in the part of not playing very well,

420
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,960
but I should get in the results. I will put in their Brazil, England and Germany.

421
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,680
Yeah, Brazil being a bit disappointed so far for me. Yeah, and I noticed that Argentina

422
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,920
actually joined favoring out for the world cup along with Brazil. So Argentina moved up a bit

423
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:40,200
in Brazil of slipback in the odds. And then we have Italy and France who I think are doing

424
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:46,680
pretty badly. They did nothing other. Nothing. And just a touch on the USA game. I'm with you on this

425
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,240
one out of. I thought they did phenomenally well on Saturday. I thought they put in a great performance.

426
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,640
And I think the biggest shame is that they would have won the game if they had managed to keep

427
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:02,360
11 men on the pitch. I reckon they were in a shot if they kept 10. Yeah. So let's look ahead

428
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,600
with a little bit. Tuesday through Friday there's actually four games a day. The times have

429
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,280
changed slightly so you have to look at the website and try and figure out where all the teams

430
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:15,000
are. But just to avoid collusion between the teams, they play the last games in the group at the

431
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,840
same time. So there's only two time slots and there's two games in each time slot. That's

432
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,520
Tuesday through Friday. And then from Saturday onwards we start with single elimination. The games

433
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,200
if they're tied at the end of regulation, they get extra time and then they get penalties to determine

434
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:36,120
a winner. And we do that until we get to the final and an ultimate winner. That will wrap it up for

435
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,760
a quick update. Once again, soccer show.com. Thanks Adam. Bye bye.

436
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,080
No dudes. I totally appreciate it since I know nothing about sports. But I am turned on by this whole

437
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,640
world cup thing. I find it exciting. I like the length of the games. You know, it's 90 minutes

438
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,720
and total. And it's good. It's all good. Totally digging it. Thank you.

439
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:01,080
Hey, this is Scott and Telly. We're actually normal teenagers. Unlike the few people we're

450
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:14,760
interview that I really like. Connecting. Sorry. Not connected. Want an ISP that helps people

451
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:21,000
instead of spying on them. Try Earthlink. They're providing free internet access to hurricane victims.

452
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:31,160
Thank you, or provider would do that. Earthlink. Plug in. Turn on. Stay connected. See,

453
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,840
now that's a reason for me to switch right there. Do you want an ISP that spies on you or

454
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,480
do you want one that helps people in need? I think that's real easy. Don't you? One more from the

455
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,440
voice mail lines that will play a final song for today. Hey, Adam. This is Alan from Houston.

456
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,560
Swarp. Pass on a Yanks versus the Britswoman. I got into the other day. Actually, yesterday,

457
00:32:53,880 --> 00:33:02,280
I called my colleagues over in Europe over in London, actually. Actually, Henley. Henley.

458
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:09,160
Henley on terms? Anyway, I was talking to them. Talk to us guy. And there was some girl bugging

459
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:16,680
him into background. And I asked him whether or not she had been hanging out with a bikey

460
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:26,040
as we can. Oh, man. Oh, no. That's not good. You know, we've used this word before when

461
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:32,040
Patricia and I were on the show and Christina's used it. You got to be very careful. We were saying

462
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:40,760
this too. People do not appreciate this. Um, I'm a bash Italy relayed that message to her.

463
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:47,880
Almost, I actually, if that then I'm actually hurt. I'm very sharp and taken breath. Oh,

464
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:56,520
you mean that like one of these? A little bit of quiet as he was chuckling. And then she just kind

465
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:03,000
of laid it to me. Oh, but it was pretty bad there for a few minutes. And then I managed to

466
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:11,160
use it by asking her what was a piky? Um, explained to her that I heard it on Christina's show.

467
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:17,400
And just kind of threw it out there trying to be cheeky with my friend. I didn't exactly

468
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:24,760
imagine he would start an international incident over. But there you go. Thanks. Bye. Oh,

469
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:31,640
by the way. Yeah. What is a piky? Okay. So let's open that up. All right. I'm sure our friends in the

470
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,760
UK would be more than happy to help us out. Understanding what a piky is. When I see

471
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:42,520
one on the street, I can usually recognize one. My daughter certainly can. It's just one more episode.

472
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,840
One more chapter in that big book of two countries divided by a common language.

473
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:10,440
The yanks versus the bits. Mind the gap. Oh, yeah. One last song is promised Jersey Todd found this

474
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:17,640
for me. You're going to love this. Daisy caught a feature in the cool key. You might want to crank this

475
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:23,080
one up. I'm going to make you feel good. Cool Keith. I'm the positive music network. Who would have

476
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:35,560
fallen kid? You're now good. You're the cooliest. That's the name of a came in the game.

477
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,760
It's not just that it's the chain. It's the same in the team. It's black, black, the race.

478
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,680
Cool. That's me, quite the cat cat to say. Who's the brain? That is the web, that the

479
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,360
thing. You don't want it, but I bet it'll catch the game. I'm the monochin, I'm honestly

480
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,200
bad back again. There's a little bit of riddle and tap tap your vein. It's the six. I'm

481
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,280
maintain it where to gain it better. It's a pain pain. It grinded again. It was said that we

482
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,200
stumbled out of the brutalist man's rights. We're not a combatant. We're doing it again. We're the

483
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,360
men's feet checking the SP. Call Mr. Kurt, you'll know the jet ski. Have you on the

484
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,200
odds yours? Hold the dress, keep the flows and damn it. You'll keep trying to face this

485
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:11,400
man. You're in a rock and pop and not twist the flexi sexy. Let pick up the phone connect

486
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,600
me. Pick up the taxi. Black and the ball. It's time to step back.

487
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,680
What a beta. I'm great. I'm percolated. The rate I get ready to burn. And the eagle beta.

488
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,400
Get ready to turn. I'm a simulator. The crowd will focus. The down move over. Each

489
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,080
you tell pipes like chocolate mocha. The verb will hurt. The first things that hurt

490
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,560
you. Reality virtue. Maybe so deep, repeat, repeat, repeat. Like breaking and

491
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,200
beat strength. They solve their crease, reap the cannibal cactus practice. Exactly back

492
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:44,280
this. We enforce and perform the moon. The mouth relaxes. I give you the access to

493
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,560
the waist like endless. They're gonna adjust that bus. A plus, they adjust the combat

494
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,840
a bus. The form on normal global warming.

495
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:57,640
Bring that feedback, man. Bring that feedback, man. Bring that feedback, man.

496
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,000
I'm a simulator. I'm a simulator.

497
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,840
They fade away. They're my lane for discoveries. They get a paper straight away. They're

498
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,640
medicated. They're brothers. Check his bucket. You bring him the aid or nothing. You

499
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,120
fakers with me. They're brought in here. When you feel the day to cover.

500
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,540
And you wake him up and sleep, man.

501
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,820
You wake him up,...

502
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,660
That's what my personal charm is.

503
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:31,660
There's no Charlie Music Colleges, Jersey Todd from the Jersey Todd Show.

504
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,180
Jersey Todd Show.com, dude, thank you so much for turning me on to this.

505
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,860
Daisy Cutter featuring Cool Keith Cool Keith, that is a big deal as Jersey Todd said

506
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,980
in his email to me, that Cool Keith is on the PMN.

507
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:48,260
I'll put a link to Cool Keith's Wikipedia entry, and of course everything you read

508
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,500
in Wikipedia is true.

509
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,700
He's been around, been around for a while, extremely cool.

510
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,780
Hey, you know, when I got to get to the office, we got some stuff to do today.

511
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:02,460
It's a real busy one because Ron's leaving on a, I think it's his fifth wedding anniversary

512
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:08,900
that's coming up, so he and Marta are leaving for some undisclosed destination tomorrow.

513
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:15,900
So we got a lot of stuff to go through today, a lot of work, a lot of meetings, a lot

514
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,900
of stuff.

515
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,700
It may or may not be our last day together for this trip.

516
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,700
It kind of depends.

517
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:26,400
Besides me missing the girls, I also want to go back and see my mom, because I can pretty

518
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,860
much only do that in a weekend, so it's still be another week.

519
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:33,900
So as I said, it's going to be a busy day, but that's my life.

520
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,100
I want you to have a good one.

521
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:35,900
Have a great one.

522
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,540
Remember, every single day you wake up and your eyes open, be happy that they actually

523
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:47,300
open, be very happy they open by cast last week.

00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,300
