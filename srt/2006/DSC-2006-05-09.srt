Delta's share at Charlie 3-8-3.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Vincent Price.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If I am feeling particularly ambitious,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I make a real curry plus all the side dishes.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Many currys are made with meats on the bone.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But for my guess, I only want to serve small boys.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I like to look around for some really exotic and very hot ones.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's the way my wife likes them.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I then skin the boys and take all of the meat from the bone.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The easy way is to stab them one at a time with a fork and heat them over a gas flame

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
on the stove until the skin bursts.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It then peels right off.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What fun?

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
To make the curry itself is child's play.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
A very simple but a very elegant dish.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Nothing makes a more exotic party.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I generally lower all the lights and burn a little child to help create a mood.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I bet I have citar records and put them on the stereo and that helps tremendously.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Candles winking everywhere are very romantic.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The visual display of the curry, all the condiments and the boys is really spectacular.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This meal depends on you to create a mood.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So be daring.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Use a different table cross or a brilliant remnant of material.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Pull out all the brass and copper you can find.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We're dangling eerie and a drape sorry if you have it and every bracelet you can find.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You'll guess we'll talk about this in a party for weeks.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hello.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Hey baby, it's me.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I told you not to call me.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I know baby, but I've got this idea and see.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I thank you, man.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
She'll make a Poon on the field.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Poon on the field.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Because I thank you, I agree.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Everybody wants to look like they look at a Poon on the field.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Everybody wants to smile at this moment.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Poon on the field.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Nobody wants to cry, no cries in the Poon on the field.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Nobody wants to cry, no one does any Poon on the field.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Poon on the field.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Big adjusting in.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You'll be the star of the show.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Get a Poon on the field.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Everybody wants to talk about the Poon on the field.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Everybody wants to walk like they walk in Poon on the field.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Nobody needs to show the machine in the Poon on the field.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Nobody needs to play in the Poon on the field.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Everybody wants to talk about the Poon on the field.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You'll be the star of the show.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You'll be the star of the show.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
When you cry, what do they get they come out to you?

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Let's see, I didn't know what to do

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You'll be the way

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I think yes, I really didn't give up

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You would come to this

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I think yes, I really didn't give up

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You would come to this

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I think yes, I really didn't give up

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I think yes, I really didn't give up

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You would come to this

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I really didn't give up

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You're unbelievable

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You're unbelievable

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You're 16 million dollars worth of airplane

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Strap to my ass

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We don't need no stick in prison

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I like to think I'm flying into this genre

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Fantastic, it's Adam Curry

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And Lady Patricia

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Hello, good morning

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
How about that for a different start?

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Different opener today

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I was just thinking you always say that to me

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Who are a boy now movie?

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
No, I don't say that

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're not a boy now movie, I say

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We live in a boy now movie

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
No, I don't say that

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I say we have sex like a boy now movie

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That's it

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Right, only you know that if you actually film that shit

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It doesn't look that good

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Of course, no

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Just let us think it looks like that

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But I like that song

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I came across on the podcast music

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's very funny, I like that

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Ampsix, AMP, SCX, AMpsix

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Very nice

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
From California

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's something else when people

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Because normally it is

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I think I love you

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I think we should be in a, we should make a porn movie

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I like that

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I like that, I like that

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Very much, that was funny

108
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Very funny

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I could have done it some more

110
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It could be open now

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
A little bit earlier

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Excuse me

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I understand the groove

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I should tell people about what happened at the tower

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Oh yeah

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's Joey

118
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
At the tower

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah

120
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's a fair oaks

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I wasn't here, but I have this on

122
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Reliable information

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So when you're, when you're landing your plane

124
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You do a circuit

125
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So you go first you fly perpendicular to the

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
To the landing strip

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Downwind then you turn left or right base

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And then you turn finals

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Which is just the last leg before you land

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And the person in front of you

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Determines the circuit

132
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So you're supposed to fly

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You know the corners that that person flies

134
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You're not supposed to cut in front

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Even though you may be faster

136
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
No

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Now it was really busy

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
At fair oaks

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And Joey

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I mean the only, one of the only women on the entire airfield

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Top girl

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Top girl definitely

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Chopper pilot

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And wants to be a cop

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Once, once to be to Bill

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Um

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So it was, you know like end of the day

149
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Close to six people are trying to get in

150
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And just a lot going on

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And then someone cuts right in front of a slower aircraft

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And then Joey utters the infamous words on the radio

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Golf Golf Alpharomio Delta

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Did you just come inside

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And it was quiet for like

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
10 seconds

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Everybody heard that

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah, I think Captain Dan went back

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't think there was an official response

160
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
For that in the radio call book

161
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I didn't say that

162
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You gotta get, you gotta get to know Dan

164
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeah

165
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay, this was funny

166
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Presuming he said that

167
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's one of these folklore things

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
In aviation and of course could have happened anywhere

169
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Coming to you from Curry Cottage

170
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This is the daily source code

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We're sure kind enough to join us today

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And there's only been really one topic

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Since yesterday afternoon

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
We've discussed nothing else in the house

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
At all

176
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Besides

177
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The new Patricia Project

178
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You've heard of the Evan Parsons project

179
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This is the Patricia Project

180
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yeah

181
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Do you want to hit it?

182
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Well

183
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You know, we actually set to each other

184
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Let's start

185
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Let's fall in love

186
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Love

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Love

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We're looking for houses

189
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You know

190
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Because we're renting this piece of shit

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That an astronomical amount of money

192
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's not a piece of shit

193
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But it's not a house

194
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But you can't fix anything

195
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Because you're pouring it into someone else's pocket

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Now all the things that we think is shit

197
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We can't do anything

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Which is most of it

199
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Which is most of it

200
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Whichless face it

201
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's the doors are too narrow too low

202
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Now we bump into you

203
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Keep bumping into your ribcage

204
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The door handles

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah, we go into you sleep

206
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Our bathroom is crap

207
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And leaking downstairs into the living room

208
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
There's no double glazing

209
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
There's no insulation

210
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yeah

211
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But the atmosphere is good

212
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And the location is empty

213
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The location is empty

214
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah

215
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Very good

216
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's a nice house

217
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So you know

218
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah

219
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's handy

220
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So I was starting

221
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And so I went to a couple of real estate agents

222
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And one of them

223
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh no, actually a couple of them

224
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Step back a second

225
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Because producer keeps looking

226
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And looking at all these great houses

227
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And then you look at the

228
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You show me things like

229
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
13 million pounds

230
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Like $25 million

231
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
On daynice

232
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Right

233
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And then I say, well, just call them up

234
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And just say, hey

235
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You know, I want to come take a look

236
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You know, you're a lady

237
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But even if you can't afford it

238
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh, it's good

239
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh, yeah

240
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You know, you need a good example

241
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah

242
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And that's actually the way I shop too

243
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I go to very expensive stores

244
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Look at it

245
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And I don't buy it

246
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Then I go to the high street

247
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And buy the same thing

248
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That looks like it

249
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Baby

250
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If I ever really introduce you

251
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The second life

252
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You would be so into the shopping there

253
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You have

254
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's all about shopping

255
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Well, let me do it in real life

256
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Okay

257
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
All right

258
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So I went to a couple of real estate agents

259
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And they gave me some brochures

260
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
To make brochures

261
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And one of them

262
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Was a house

263
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That we actually seen

264
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
In something that we got

265
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Remember that

266
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
By mail or

267
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Well, that was a while ago

268
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Sometimes you get those brochures in the mail

269
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And we saw it

270
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And we set immediately

271
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The looks nice from the outside

272
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And you set to me

273
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Why don't you phone them up

274
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And just take a look at it

275
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And see what it is

276
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah

277
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But we never did

278
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I don't know what happened

279
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
We never did

280
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So one of the brochures that I got

281
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Last week

282
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It was the same house again

283
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Better known as horn castle

284
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yeah, so we called it horn castle

285
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Right

286
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And because it's a castle

287
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I mean, it doesn't look like a castle

288
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But it looks like a little palace

289
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's more like something

290
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah

291
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's got something

292
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So staying in my

293
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
In my alliterations of curry castle

294
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Curry curry cottage

295
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It could be Patricia's palace

296
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So we thought

297
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Maybe that's a sign

298
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Patricia's palace

299
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Pat's palace

300
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Sorry

301
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Pat's palace

302
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Or anything

303
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So we went there yesterday

304
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
To check it out in the end

305
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Outside is nice

306
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
First and evening

307
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We went together

308
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Just check out where it was

309
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And what kind of neighborhood

310
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You know, just, you know

311
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Before you say anything

312
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Let's just check it out

313
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Because sometimes it's no need to go

314
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You know, if you see where it is

315
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So we checked it out

316
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And it was actually very

317
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And shunting

318
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And chanting

319
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
On shunting

320
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Shunting

321
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Very

322
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah, I have to say

323
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's about the same size

324
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
As the cottage

325
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's not huge

326
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But it's

327
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It is very charming

328
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's very charming

329
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Very charming

330
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And when I'm done with

331
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
A great place for entertaining

332
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Oh yeah

333
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So

334
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I

335
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
We probably think

336
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That it used to be one huge

337
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That's why

338
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah, it's been

339
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's a palace

340
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
A palace

341
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
A palace

342
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
A castle

343
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It was a castle

344
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
A castle

345
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
A castle

346
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It was a castle

347
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It was chopped into the throats

348
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Probably

349
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I only have like 40 minutes on

350
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So I don't get to the good stuff

351
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So you know

352
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
No

353
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And if I don't board this

354
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
In English

355
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It has a real

356
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Boardess

357
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
A board

358
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
A queen waves

359
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah, a little about

360
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's not a balcony

361
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But it's more

362
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The entire length of the house

363
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Very brilliant

364
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah, yeah

365
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You can wave to your peeps from there

366
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So from the outside

367
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
We really liked it

368
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Now we had a peak

369
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
In the inside

370
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
With the real estate

371
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He's a lot of work

372
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yep

373
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I mean this is like

374
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Serious ass

375
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Rebuilding

376
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Re-changing the inside

377
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah

378
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Can you not stick that in your ear?

379
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Why not?

380
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Well, I'm asking you, keep falling out

381
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah, my ears are too small

382
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Do you need me to help you?

383
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
No, it's okay

384
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I can do it

385
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's just annoying

386
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
No, you know why

387
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I have warm ears

388
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Because I just had my walk on the down

389
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh, that is a big spanned

390
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yeah, they pop out of you

391
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah

392
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You know why

393
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It goes to 11

394
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And it's exploding

395
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I wasn't a funny to see this

396
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's my laptop

397
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah, it was on over there

398
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Just watch it over and over and over

399
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Well, at a certain point it's like, okay

400
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I remember it again

401
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And I do recognize

402
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
All the situers

403
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That was on sky

404
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Over the weekend

405
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But anyway

406
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I made a little mood board

407
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
How

408
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The house

409
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I was already in the mood

410
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But I do

411
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Is it

412
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'd you've got to see the mood board that I've made

413
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah, you know

414
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You're right on

415
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You're right on

416
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And see what you can do with it

417
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And what the colors

418
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Could have been

419
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And you know

420
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So it's just fantasizing about it

421
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
We have a lot of questions

422
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And also

423
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Very interesting

424
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And that's why I went a bit slow with a house

425
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Because what's going on

426
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
In the back

427
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Is

428
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Sort of a garden

429
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah, you have to understand

430
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's built on a hill

431
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So it's built up

432
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Like just

433
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You know, if we actually go through this

434
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'll put some pictures on that

435
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yeah, it comes down

436
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I mean

437
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's just ridiculous

438
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
From your kitchen window

439
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You just look at a mole

440
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So anyway, so the best laid plans

441
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Where I said the next house

442
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
We have we both have individual bedrooms

443
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Because I definitely want to have my own bedroom

444
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
But I want to be able to visit you

445
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I frequently

446
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
As much as you can on

447
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
People think that's really strange

448
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
We say that that that we wouldn't mind

449
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Separate beds

450
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
People think that's really

451
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But

452
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Didn't we explain

453
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The way we have my habits and your habits

454
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah, I'm a big sweaty man

455
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Although we love each other so much

456
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I mean, you don't want to go to bed

457
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And you have of course

458
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But anyway

459
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's all a mood point now

460
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Because my bedroom now is now changed into the bathroom

461
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So it doesn't matter anymore

462
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I guess you're stuck with me

463
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
No, but we have a plenty of rooms upstairs

464
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
No problem at all

465
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But I want my own room

466
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't want to be in the guest room

467
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Go to the attic

468
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Sit that thing in your room

469
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I want laughing and pop that

470
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You know, Roger Smalls is

471
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Actually, I was going to say

472
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I noticed yesterday when looking through that

473
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
That I had a much

474
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Clear vision of what we could do

475
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
With the house

476
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Then

477
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Previously

478
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Because

479
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And you're going to laugh at me

480
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
When I say this

481
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh, not again

482
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's true

483
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Because we're building stuff in second life

484
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But isn't it the way they actually

485
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The architex and everything work

486
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
When they build houses

487
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Well, yeah

488
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You can walk around like that

489
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yeah, so this is very, very similar

490
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And so I'm looking down like

491
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Hmm, we could just chop this wall in half

492
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And round it off like that

493
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And I find myself

494
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Almost wanting to move my mouse finger

495
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
To click and you know

496
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And to move the wall

497
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh, yeah

498
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You do it in second life

499
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Oh, that's what they do

500
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
When they make a

501
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And design or something

502
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
They do that

503
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You can walk through the house

504
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Before it's done

505
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But it's really affected me

506
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm not making

507
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm not making it

508
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I believe you

509
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's really affected me

510
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Or maybe if we find somebody who can do that

511
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
In second life

512
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
In second life

513
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
In second life

514
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
In real life

515
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
We can see what you can do with the house

516
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So that's what we're going to try

517
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
We're thinking about and see what the

518
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The

519
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Very cool

520
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yeah

521
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm building things with two different women at the same time

522
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Oh

523
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yeah

524
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm building the

525
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Potio Palace with Brittany

526
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Remember

527
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Oh, yeah, Brittany

528
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
No, not Brittany

529
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Brittany

530
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I say that

531
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
But that's incorrect

532
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah, I know a Brittany

533
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But just Brittany

534
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
There's no A.N.

535
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
No Brittany

536
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's Brittany

537
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Oh, okay

538
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Brittany

539
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah

540
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I know

541
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What is that

542
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
A lot of time with Brittany

543
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
No, that's

544
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yes, you do

545
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Some

546
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
But it's going to be very cool

547
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
As long as you have fun

548
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Oh, God, I love you so much

549
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Do you know how many guys are listening to this now going like

550
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Like

551
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Listen

552
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Why don't I give me one of those

553
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You know

554
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's nice to see that your husband is busy

555
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That's true

556
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Not sitting around

557
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So he can't

558
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
He can't nag

559
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Or

560
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Do I ever nag you in the way?

561
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Oh, okay, yes, I'm often often in the way

562
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So but anyway

563
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Roger Smalls, I think he's pissed off at me

564
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh, we haven't heard from him for like three weeks now

565
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
True

566
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And he put this whole thing on his on his weblog

567
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That he can't well he can't get on this

568
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
He just he hates second life

569
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Everything about it

570
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
He doesn't want to be a part of it

571
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And he feels left out

572
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And it's like I don't know what to do

573
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But he's not sending in any more stuff

574
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Well, there you go

575
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yeah, but a couple people

576
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You're losing friends, huh?

577
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Oh, Roger come back

578
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'll do anything

579
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Yeah, please

580
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah, please

581
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Gaining of gaining friends in the air

582
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And in your second life

583
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Losing them in RL

584
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
In real life

585
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
How you doing?

586
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Didn't I warn you about that

587
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I haven't this is Simon James, a listener and pod say fart is from the UK

588
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I've been listening to the Charlie for about again

589
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I love it

590
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm a little miss an episode

591
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I was listening to your comments

592
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's a day on hypnotizing your listeners

593
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And I was wondering

594
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Why you wanted to do that

595
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I understand from another closing point of view

596
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It might be quite a nice trick to have it

597
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You sleep

598
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But it sounds a little bit too much like

599
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
A plot from an often empowered film to me

600
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Look at you, man

601
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
See you on the next one

602
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's a little genius

603
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Don't worry

604
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Anyway

605
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And Simon, I did check out your tunes

606
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Thank you very much

607
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And definitely going to play them on a future

608
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
A future Charlie

609
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
But I was already stacked up for today

610
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So I started this conversation

611
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I don't know last week or whatever

612
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I said

613
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You know we did this in Saio thing

614
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And let's be honest

615
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
If someone burps in this house

616
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Don't you automatically think Saio?

617
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Oh yeah

618
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And I hear

619
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Christina has doing it

620
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah, because you never burp a problem

621
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You never do it in school, man

622
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You never burp do you?

623
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Oh

624
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Like a truck driver

625
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah

626
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And then I say

627
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm sorry but I need to

628
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
They're not okay

629
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm not going to hold in the air

630
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The only thing you have to say is

631
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Saio

632
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You don't have to even say

633
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm sorry

634
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
No, I say these things

635
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Only if I get paid for it

636
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Unlike me

637
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Full not getting paid for this in Saio

638
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You remember when I met you

639
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You were drinking milk

640
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You didn't notice

641
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You were actually

642
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yeah, the TV show

643
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The producers made me drink milk

644
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yeah, but you didn't

645
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I didn't know it was sponsored by

646
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
They said don't drink a beer

647
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm going to ride away

648
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But I got a car out of that later

649
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Because I told you

650
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I got a car out of there

651
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Got my back, baby

652
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I was young

653
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And defenseless

654
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Like a little deer stuck in the headlights

655
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And that's what you saw

656
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And went

657
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I saw my pulse

658
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I was fresh boy

659
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Mead

660
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah

661
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So we were talking about this

662
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And so the Saio thing is

663
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Neurolinguistic Programming

664
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You know I've messed around with that

665
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You're trying to link stuff

666
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And it worked

667
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I've helped Christina over a lot of fears

668
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And things by anchoring

669
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Good thoughts to

670
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Or good thoughts to good images, etc

671
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But apparently there's this

672
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Your body's made up of protons

673
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And electricity and stuff

674
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's not like your

675
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What made a wood

676
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
So you're all even wood

677
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's all made up of stuff

678
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Electric bits and pieces

679
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yeah, that's why I'm disturbing you

680
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Every time

681
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Whenever Patricia comes near a computer

682
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Garanty people freeze up

683
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I don't think it could be

684
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It could be a super company

685
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I don't know

686
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It would freeze up

687
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's true

688
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Yeah

689
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So

690
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
There's some theories out there

691
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
That if you get the right frequency

692
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Sound

693
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And you have that in your ears

694
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You can also

695
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Not well, maybe not hypnotized

696
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But you can program your

697
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Body, your mood

698
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Levitate

699
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
No

700
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Let me see if that's in the program

701
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Yeah

702
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Do we have a levitate

703
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
No

704
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But you understand what I'm saying

705
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Yeah

706
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So basically

707
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
If you

708
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You know, some people do it

709
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
With those

710
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Headphones

711
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And sunglasses

712
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And these flashes of light

713
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
In the sunglasses

714
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So

715
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
There's this thing called

716
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The Brainwave Generator

717
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And I'll put a link to it in the show notes, of course

718
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's only for windows

719
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
But what the hell

720
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I took the time to install it

721
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So we have all these different tone

722
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Settings

723
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And so we have one that can

724
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Attention

725
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Focus your attention

726
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Increase your creativity

727
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Three for headache treatment

728
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
One for learning

729
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Meditation

730
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What else is there

731
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Quick mental refresher

732
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Relaxation

733
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Or self hypnosis

734
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Sleep induction

735
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And the awakened mind

736
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Okay

737
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Which one would you like to try

738
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Hard repair

739
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Let me see

740
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Hmm

741
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
No

742
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
No, but maybe if we use

743
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The self hypnosis

744
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yeah

745
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Maybe you can tell yourself

746
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Repair your heart

747
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Okay

748
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Ready to try

749
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah, look at my eyes

750
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Look at my eyes

751
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Look at my eyes

752
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Listen to this

753
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Crap

754
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Not working all of a sudden

755
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Right?

756
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Tested that 15 times all of it

757
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I know what that is

758
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You lost it

759
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
No, no, no

760
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Feel anything yet

761
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
What does it do?

762
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
That's a

763
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I can't remember

764
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Now relaxation

765
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Now that's that's self hypnosis

766
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You want to relax?

767
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It sounds a bit like you can hear your blood gush

768
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Well here's this is relaxation while staying focused

769
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So I think this is good

770
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Because even if you're driving the car right now

771
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's okay to listen to this sound

772
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You relaxed

773
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
No, I don't like

774
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You're not relaxed

775
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
None of the drives me crazy

776
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
That shit really worked

777
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah

778
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
How about a mental refresher

779
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Maybe that'll help

780
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Almost as I remember

781
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I have to pay the bills

782
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I can imagine

783
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's irritating

784
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So it will probably

785
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
warn you or something

786
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's place in promos

787
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000

It's Killer Fiction

859
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
From Todd McKinney

860
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
And Curie's Metro sexual moment

861
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Oh harmonious

862
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Cool

863
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So I think I have you here

864
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You might as well do a Metro sexual moment

865
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Because you are the authority when it comes to men

866
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Oh yeah

867
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Okay, so sleeping with your man

868
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I thought it would be the topic for today's Metro sexual moment

869
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Because let's be honest

870
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It's not

871
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
It never is a really good idea

872
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I mean men and women are so fundamentally different

873
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Very different

874
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
When it comes to sleeping and you and I

875
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I think we definitely

876
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yeah

877
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Yeah, but I don't think everybody has that problem

878
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
That you have

879
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
So let's just say hypothetically speaking

880
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You have a very long husband

881
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Yeah

882
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Very long

883
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Everybody's too short

884
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Everybody's too short

885
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
He continuously

886
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Let's when I'm just start with the covers

887
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
He rolls self in a pancake

888
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Yeah

889
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You don't like DuVase

890
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
DuVase

891
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
DuVase

892
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Yeah, you hate that

893
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Yeah

894
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So you want sheets

895
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Yes

896
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Which they are very hard to find

897
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
But I found them

898
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
So women, so for first of all

899
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And this of course is for guys right

900
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
We're giving guys a very son

901
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Yeah, so you want sheets

902
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So the DuVase has to go

903
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Plankage

904
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Yeah

905
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And then on top of that sort of a very nice light

906
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Wait, come for dinner

907
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Come for dinner

908
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
That's what you like

909
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
But is that what women would like to

910
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Is that too?

911
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I like to feel something on top of me

912
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Oh yeah

913
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It's not exactly the problem

914
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I like to feel my blankets

915
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I like you know

916
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
You could be very fluffy and very easy

917
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
But you're not a guy

918
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So we don't care about you

919
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And this is the Metro

920
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Because we are always cold

921
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I've cold feet

922
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yeah

923
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You know, I'm always cold

924
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
So what if your guy has like horrible night sweats

925
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Yeah

926
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
What do you do with it?

927
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And I don't know why I don't have them all the time

928
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Maybe

929
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Could be a couple of things

930
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Could be the splits

931
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I

932
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I

933
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I don't get to play

934
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I don't get to play

935
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I don't get to play

936
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I don't get to play

937
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I don't get to play

938
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I don't get to play

939
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I don't get to play

940
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah

941
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So could be that

942
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Possibility

943
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Yeah

944
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Could be that your brains

945
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Never stop

946
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
They're working

947
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Yeah

948
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Yeah

949
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Yeah

950
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
No, no, that's not true

951
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Because the split definitely combats

952
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
That's showed up repeat the day

953
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
You know?

954
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
That's the thing that you did

955
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
That's supposedly

956
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Yeah, your brains aren't going to be

957
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Because I'm here

958
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I'm in San Francisco

959
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Thousands miles

960
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm all over the place

961
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
No, but I mean

962
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yeah, that's true

963
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
But the hell am I?

964
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
What the?

965
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I can't say

966
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Oh, I must be the codi

967
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And sometimes

968
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You have those sweat attacks

969
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Yeah, but let us call it that

970
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
There's anything that guys who might suffer from this

971
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Yeah

972
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
There's nothing more embarrassing than that

973
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,880
We tried everything. We tried shower in the morning, so you don't

974
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,040
shower in the morning, shower in the evening, shower in the sound time. So we tried

975
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,560
shower in the night that evening doesn't help. Because if you come out out of the

976
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,680
shower, you're still very warm. You're going your bed and you start to sweat. You

977
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,040
not make it. But it's really embarrassing. I'm sure other people have that. Yeah,

978
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,280
so sometimes I want to just, you know, cover which you're a

979
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:18,440
ejaculator than a sweater. That is a problem, too. Not with me. I sometimes I want to

980
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:24,640
spoon spoon. I want to spoon. And then I want to feel you tiny little

981
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,640
bots. Yeah. And here, no. And have you on my lap? The other way around doesn't

982
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:38,640
matter and spoon it a bit. But then, but then suddenly, it gets so wet. It's you. You

983
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,840
know, you make it. That's what it is. You're making me blow up. And then I wake up

984
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,880
and I think, holy shit, what is this? And then my whole knees are wet. We have

985
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,120
actually, we have actually considered the fact that I just might be one of those

986
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:56,400
people who can spontaneously combust. Yeah. You know, I'll be sitting in the chair

987
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,000
and then I'll just explode and my legs will burn up and have my body all

988
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,440
being on. Absolutely. I think so we have no cure for this currently. This is

989
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,080
still something. And I think that this is something that we love to sleep with each other,

990
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:16,400
but you know. Okay. And let me play this Metro about one of our pet peeves.

991
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,800
The Metro Sweaty moment. Thank you.

992
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,240
Well, I hope I'm leaving him to have him carry his other way. This is not going to make

993
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,280
much sense. I don't really get to travel around the world much. I don't get to

994
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,960
13 people. But I think. But I think.

995
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,840
Not all on a second. He can't fucking hear what he's saying. I got to on the music

996
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
up.

997
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,320
Two floors for a conference this week. And I'm staying at the Rhett's Colton in

998
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:45,000
Orlando. Absolutely smashing hotel. Yeah. And I just thought that I have a look

999
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,600
around and sure enough we have the marble lined bathroom. We have the

1000
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:58,920
huge flat screen TV with built-in PlayStation. We have the internet

1001
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:05,040
connectivity. But the one thing that really made me smile and made me think of

1002
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:16,920
you, Mr. Curry, whether we have plug-in and drives and they got extendable

1003
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:25,560
cords and my deals are that Metro sexual man. I thought he was starting to talk

1004
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,680
about that because you missed that. That toilet is a bit particular toilet.

1005
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,040
The one that shoots water in the ass.

1006
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:39,080
I love that you do that. I feel so clean and fresh. And it's made for women.

1007
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:44,960
No, it's not made for women. Where is that? It's like a bathroom and a

1008
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,080
be-day and one. No, no, no, no, no.

1009
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,800
It's okay. I use the be-day, too. You got it for you.

1010
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,080
I love the be-day.

1011
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,520
Are you going to go that? You're nice.

1012
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,040
Yeah. Well, I think that that is probably a topic for another Metro sexual moment.

1013
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:06,760
Good news, baby. When we go to San Francisco, you didn't hear it yesterday because we

1014
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,400
know you never listened to the show. But a Ranger Craig-

1015
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,680
I hear you the whole day.

1016
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,160
Yeah, but you didn't hear it. You don't hear what's being played on the show.

1017
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,160
Yes. You don't care about the show.

1018
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,800
I'm getting an overdose at him curry at home.

1019
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,960
20 years long, babe. Well, you know what? I was just saying to myself the other day,

1020
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,640
I can't wait to be in San Francisco alone pretty soon.

1021
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,080
Really, you mean that? No, but just trying to be mean.

1022
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,240
Oh, you don't mean that because then you call me.

1023
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,440
The moment I sit down, you call me.

1024
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,120
It's the time you say. I want to see you put the camera on your face.

1025
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,520
Yeah, no, not on your face, but on your face.

1026
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,520
What are you wearing on? Oh, what are you wearing on?

1027
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,280
Go a little bit back. Oh, okay.

1028
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,360
Oh, yes. Show me that one again.

1029
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,320
Yeah, right. Oh, yeah. And then amazing.

1030
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,720
It's unbelievable. See you next time.

1031
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,160
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1032
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,160
So, yeah.

1033
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,720
Okay, well, no. But because the question in the phone rings.

1034
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,440
And I said to see that, oh, it's dead again.

1035
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,600
You guys like, you know, you don't give a shit.

1036
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,760
See, you don't care about my show.

1037
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,720
It's one of my sentences.

1038
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,080
Just give a Christ. It's dead again. He's calling.

1039
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,240
Exactly the wrong moment because America's next top model is on or something.

1040
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,080
No, no, no, no, no. It's endless.

1041
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,560
Dude, I do, I totally, totally, totally coordinate with the East Ender schedule.

1042
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,680
That's not true. Oh, I'm sorry, Nick Tucker's on.

1043
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,400
I can't. Yeah. Oh, I wish, no, they're gone.

1044
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,200
But East End is, it's very relaxing. It's simple.

1045
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,800
I love it. It's simple. And it just clears your brain.

1046
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,480
Tonight, I'll be Grant and you be Jane.

1047
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,000
Anyway, I'm back to Ranger Craig.

1048
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,120
So he works at Alcatraz. And so he has this whole thing about Baghdad.

1049
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,520
The San Francisco used to be called Baghdad by the Bay,

1050
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,240
which I thought was funny, but there's a whole history behind it.

1051
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,720
Oh, hi.

1052
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,080
Herb Cain referred to it as the city Baghdad by the Bay.

1053
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,240
As for your trip to Baghdad by the day, I'm on Alcatraz on Sundays,

1054
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,240
but not on Saturdays, which dates will you be there.

1055
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,680
We're going to get a special tour dude.

1056
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,080
Hmm. Ranger Craig will take us around.

1057
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,880
How cool is that?

1058
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,360
Hi, that's cool.

1059
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,320
Could you really want to see it?

1060
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,240
Yeah. All right. So we'll make it Saturday, Ranger Craig.

1061
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,160
Feedback was great. I just love people.

1062
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,560
You know, people just calling up listeners calling up.

1063
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,840
So much fun to hear him. In Jersey 201-625-6357,

1064
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,680
or in London, 020-768-1375-3,

1065
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,840
just saying Jersey reminds me to thank Jersey Todd for the opening of today's

1066
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,200
daily source code. He totally hooked me up with that Vincent Price thing.

1067
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,560
I had no idea where he got it.

1068
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,240
It's so scary.

1069
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,920
Only a Jersey guy could understand that.

1070
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,960
It was send it to me, right?

1071
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,640
He boy.

1072
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,920
So someone called the listener called the other day about,

1073
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,640
I thought it was on KLA radio in Los Angeles,

1074
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,880
but it turned out to be a podcast, which actually pretty funny,

1075
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,160
and she called back, listening to this.

1076
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,160
Hi, Adam. I have to talk for a little bit because I'm at work,

1077
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,720
but I want to say that I suit my voicemail on Friday,

1078
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,000
and one of the clear-up is actually KLA radio.

1079
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,840
It's a podcast, and I think I figured out that,

1080
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,240
I think the guy just used some clips of your voice,

1081
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,440
but was pretty funny though.

1082
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,560
So I just wanted to clear it out, but you're doing great.

1083
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,920
Okay, let's go. Bye.

1084
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,560
Okay. Now, what I liked about this phone call,

1085
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,200
here's what I liked about it. I mean, not too much what she was saying,

1086
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,880
but she was at work.

1087
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,800
She's at work. She's doing it secretly,

1088
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,680
and it sounded really...

1089
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,680
On table, on the other day.

1090
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,760
Yeah, so what I want is I want people to call up,

1091
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,200
yeah, I want people to call up more,

1092
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,800
but you have to be, you have to speak clearly,

1093
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,600
and you have to have a good phone connection.

1094
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,640
But that's clear.

1095
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,280
Listen to listen, I can't talk, it's really sexy.

1096
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,640
Listen to it, listen to it, listen to it.

1097
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,040
Hi Adam, I have to talk very little because I'm at work,

1098
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,320
but I want to say that I suit my voice.

1099
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,920
And tell me what you're doing at work.

1100
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,640
Yeah.

1101
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,080
Yeah. And then call me.

1102
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,640
Yeah.

1103
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,880
So I can play it on the show, right?

1104
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,160
Yeah.

1105
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,720
I think they'll do it.

1106
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,080
Of course.

1107
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,760
Yeah, I love that secret stuff.

1108
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,400
Okay.

1109
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,560
I can see her sitting on her deck.

1110
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,520
Exactly, that's it.

1111
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,800
Did you get a visual order?

1112
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,120
Had in her bag or something, her hand bag.

1113
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,960
I'm inside the Gucci.

1114
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,400
I'm in my hand bag.

1115
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,360
Alrighty.

1116
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,360
What else happened this week?

1117
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,040
On Thursday, we're going to go back to the pet's palace.

1118
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,760
Pat's palace.

1119
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,280
Do you hear your pet project?

1120
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,240
We're going to go with taking a professional

1121
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,440
to look at the house and the inside and the walls

1122
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,040
and everything is in check it out,

1123
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,400
because it's very old.

1124
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,480
I'll bring X-Dar and it's possible.

1125
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,640
The thing that we actually would like to do to the house.

1126
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:43,600
And ask for, oh, and I talk to the lady from the

1127
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:49,200
real estate agent, and she asked Helen, and she asked the vendors.

1128
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,640
That's what they call her, right?

1129
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,440
Venders.

1130
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,040
You mean the old dudes were selling it?

1131
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,840
People were selling it.

1132
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,480
Yeah, the vendors.

1133
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,120
That's what we say.

1134
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,080
The people are selling it.

1135
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:02,160
And they're going to provide us with papers and

1136
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,920
very interesting stories about the house.

1137
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,320
Oh, the back also, we can tell people about the house stories.

1138
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,120
Yeah, so that.

1139
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,320
And we can change the name, right?

1140
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,880
And I already checked, is there anything in that ski slope in the bag

1141
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,560
that you know, Indian burial ground?

1142
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,760
If you want to do something with the garden, we need a good garden designer.

1143
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,640
And do something with that.

1144
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,080
Can we get one of those to top?

1145
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,120
Can we get the flying gardener?

1146
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,280
One of those TV shows to do it for us?

1147
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,320
We'll disguise ourselves.

1148
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,960
See, somebody like that, because you see it on TV.

1149
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,600
And somebody comes in in a couple of days.

1150
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,720
You have a nice garden.

1151
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,120
I would have to say, I want to dusk it all.

1152
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:41,040
All things all things aside, we would be perfect for one of those.

1153
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,160
You know, we're one of these, we bought a piece of shit.

1154
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,720
We're building a great house project TV show.

1155
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,400
We'll be, I mean, we're dynamic.

1156
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,360
Yeah, we'll be perfect.

1157
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,240
It would be good.

1158
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,440
It would be funny on TV.

1159
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,480
Yeah, it would be good.

1160
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,440
Not in Holland.

1161
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,200
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1162
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,200
No, but I think just the two of us would be pretty funny.

1163
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,880
Because we need an Architech to do the inside and

1164
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,320
an architect for the outside.

1165
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,400
Yeah, it's quite in, um, uh, wasn't out there.

1166
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,120
Big deal.

1167
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,960
Oh, you need a challenge.

1168
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,760
A challenge.

1169
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,600
Yeah, the whole thing is a challenge.

1170
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,040
Yeah, very much, especially the backyard.

1171
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,560
You have no idea.

1172
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,040
Yeah.

1173
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,320
But when it's done, then we can have the ideas.

1174
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,360
Yeah, and then we'll have a garden house with a hot tub up on top.

1175
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,640
And it's Jacuzzi on top of the floor.

1176
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,880
Overlooking the mountain, overlooking the mountain.

1177
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,920
The city of Gilford.

1178
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,160
And you ever saw, are you kidding me?

1179
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,640
Simple.

1180
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,400
Got to put some postballs down there and take advantage of you.

1181
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,000
So let's see.

1182
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,120
Let's see what happens and let's see what the professionals are saying.

1183
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,760
Okay.

1184
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,080
Okay.

1185
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,120
That's so funny.

1186
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,720
Finally, that ear plug fell in into your cleavage.

1187
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,360
Yeah, finally.

1188
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,400
Finally, to my cleavage.

1189
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,920
Hello, hello, boys.

1190
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,400
Can you hear me?

1191
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,240
Hello, hello, all right.

1192
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,200
I'm going to play one more song on.

1193
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
This is the song that everyone's playing.

1194
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,960
And I've played it a couple weeks ago.

1195
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,200
I think when Kevin gave me his new album.

1196
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,120
You saw the video last night, which I think I should post up as well.

1197
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,840
Oh, yeah, I know what you mean about mom.

1198
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,640
Yeah, isn't that sweet?

1199
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,560
And I remember playing this.

1200
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,600
There are a lot of songs about mom.

1201
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,880
But they cannot be enough songs about moms.

1202
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,600
I think so.

1203
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,400
You're so right.

1204
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,040
You're so right.

1205
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,600
Well, people are just going to ape shit over this song.

1206
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,040
And the timing.

1207
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,800
I mean, this is mothers.

1208
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,720
Do you know how hard it is to get a record company to cooperate,

1209
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,440
to release a song in conjunction with mother's day?

1210
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,440
Yeah, but it's not mother's day in England.

1211
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,440
The biggest mother's day.

1212
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,680
Give it Kevin Reeves lives in Nashville.

1213
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,840
Yeah, maybe mother's day over there too.

1214
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,720
It is no mother.

1215
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,680
It's the second May in a second Sunday in May,

1216
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,040
is mother's day in the United States.

1217
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,920
So that's next week.

1218
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,720
All right.

1219
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,120
Yep.

1220
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,120
And so don't harsh the guys, Melo.

1221
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,720
Oh, all right.

1222
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,040
I mean, what I was saying is it's so cool that he can time this release himself.

1223
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,000
Yeah.

1224
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,960
And podcasts are sitting around going like, gee,

1225
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,840
you know, mothers days coming up.

1226
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,600
Oh, yes, one mother's day.

1227
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,720
So for mother's day.

1228
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,520
Every day.

1229
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,880
Yep.

1230
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:12,400
So without further ado, Kevin Reeves and mother.

1231
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:34,560
I have been down.

1232
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,680
I have been out.

1233
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,040
And I feel like my life's killing him.

1234
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:50,000
And I can't seem to find your life's about.

1235
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,840
And I've lost my direction again.

1236
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:03,440
But I'm feeling lonely at the end of the day.

1237
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,800
I know that my son is phone call the way.

1238
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,760
Because he's here.

1239
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,000
Oh, mother.

1240
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,240
Oh, the wings smile.

1241
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,280
We're so wet and spent sleeping.

1242
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,680
And he's here.

1243
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:34,800
Mother, mother, take my broken heart in your safe and leave.

1244
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,440
We're now stripped away.

1245
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:52,720
Nothing more can I say than I love you.

1246
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,480
Here I go.

1247
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,440
Here I go.

1248
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:05,440
I am making a sound that came for me.

1249
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:11,600
But I know what I know that I can tell.

1250
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:18,960
Because you're sharing me on all the day.

1251
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,960
I'm feeling lost in the dead of the night.

1252
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:33,520
And tell me that I can't don't give up the fight of this year.

1253
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,680
Oh, mother.

1254
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,680
Oh, the wings smile.

1255
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,400
We're so wet and spent sleeping.

1256
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,800
And he's here.

1257
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:56,240
Mother, mother, take my broken heart in your safe and leave.

1258
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,800
We're now stripped away.

1259
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:09,200
Nothing more can I say than I love you.

1260
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:36,800
Oh, mother, take my broken heart.

1261
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:46,800
I'm feeling my broken heart in your safe and leave.

1262
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:54,800
I'm feeling my broken heart in your safe and leave.

1263
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:04,800
We're so wet and spent sleeping.

1264
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:14,800
Oh, mother, take my broken heart in your safe and leave.

1265
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:26,800
Oh, mother, take my broken heart in your safe and leave.

1266
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:54,800
Oh, I love the harmonies.

1267
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,800
Isn't that great?

1268
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,800
You want to glide with them?

1269
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,800
Yeah.

1270
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,800
Even if you don't know how to do it, you just want to go.

1271
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,800
It's great.

1272
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,800
So I just...

1273
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,800
Beautiful courts.

1274
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,800
Kevin Reeves from the Podsake Music Network, music.podshow.com.

1275
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,800
I just popped off an email to Chris Bershiers.

1276
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,800
Whoopcaster guy?

1277
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,800
Oh, yeah.

1278
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,800
Because he, of course, runs that.

1279
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,800
Even though we're opening up all sales when Podshow plus launches, I'm going to ask him

1280
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,800
to enable Kevin Reeves.

1281
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,800
So people can buy that for the mom from Mother's Day.

1282
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,800
Would that be nice?

1283
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,800
Yeah.

1284
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,800
Okay.

1285
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,800
All right, baby.

1286
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,800
Good idea.

1287
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,800
Yeah.

1288
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,800
Well, we aim to please here at Podshow.

1289
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,800

Sounds like a porn place, doesn't it?

1298
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,800
It does.

1299
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,800
Yeah.

1300
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,800
Oh, there goes the neighborhood.

1301
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,800
Pat'sPalest isn't it?

1302
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,800
Thank you.

1303
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,800
Everybody wants to know what to like and look at it.

1304
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,800

1305
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,800
Okay.

Would you do some for Earthlink?

00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,800
Depends on what.

1324
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,800
Yes indeed.

1325
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,800
Do you know how many people send me email every single day.

1326
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:41,480
it positive. Do you have any idea how many people ask that? It's unbelievable. You never do that.

1327
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:47,640
I got like a million song writers, a million producers, musicians, and they'll make the whole

1328
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:53,160
track for you anything you just don't, you're not at all. I don't feel like it. If I had a voice

1329
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:59,800
like you. I did it all. Don't forget, I've starred when I was 15 years old, so I've been

1330
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:11,000
playing my instrument. I'm a professional. I think it's not, it's not a hobby. Really?

1331
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,400
Yeah, for me, it's not a hobby. You know, I'll pay you that. How much sounds? No, no, no.

1332
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,560
I'm going to take note about that. What's it going to take? No, no. Leave me alone.

1333
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,000
Do you understand why people ask? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1334
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Because people in your art want to hear how new generation and they are so good these days.

1335
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,800
You know, they are so good. I'm from old school. That's why if you put the two together,

1336
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,800
it would be so wonderful. No, I don't need to. Let them. I know you don't need to, but people

1337
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:45,640
have no need. I have no need at all. Not at all. I do it sometimes just, you know, for fun in

1338
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:52,200
the bathroom more. Some are screaming through the house. I do it sometimes. It's fun in the bathroom

1339
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:58,120
too. But if you say every time you sing, I say, hello, you all right? I know. This is my

1340
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:04,520
frustration. I mean, yes, thank you. We know that I'm not the singer in the, at the cottage.

1341
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:09,800
Something's going on. He's in pain. It's a no, I'm singing. So that's why I, well,

1342
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:15,400
guys, I gave it a shot, okay? I can't convince her. I know, but maybe if I love music,

1343
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,160
listen, if I, if I leave it to the young, if I gave you the right song, if I, if I, if I

1344
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:24,520
played you the right song and had the right lyrics and all you had to do and all you had

1345
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:30,520
the, what, you can't get in passion by a song? No, no, no, I leave it to the new talents.

1346
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:37,800
Really, they're so good these days. Are you afraid? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1347
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:43,240
I think sometimes it's so pathetic when you're old and you're older or you're going to do your

1348
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:48,760
act again. It is so, okay, but that's where I'd like to correct you. This is not about an act. This

1349
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:55,080
is about a movement. This is about you. It's not necessary for me. It's not necessarily for me.

1350
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:59,960
It's not necessary. I know, but would you do it if I asked you? Well, sometimes we, you know,

1351
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:06,360
we did something together and did some music and sang it a bit. And we have our, we have my,

1352
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,920
I have my machine downstairs. You can't really open. Okay. What is fun? But I can't, you know,

1353
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:15,000
you can't play those songs. When my daughter is next to me and I sing with her and I think,

1354
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,520
oh my god, I'm singing with my daughter. And you know what, whenever you're, whenever you're

1355
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:24,840
listening to things, you know what I think? Oh, she's in pain. No, she's no, she's very musical.

1356
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:30,840
She's good. She's good. She doesn't care about it, but, but it's not her. But we can't play

1357
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:36,920
those songs on the show because they're not pot safe. I know, I know. I hate that shit. Yeah,

1358
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,640
hate is a shit. Now, and you know what, there are, you know that I always say there are so many

1359
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:46,920
other things that I would like to try. I've, I've tried it. I did it. I've done it. I've been in

1360
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:54,440
every studio. And now, I think, you know, I'm also very, um, artistic. So I love to design. I love to,

1361
00:49:54,440 --> 00:50:01,160
you know, be busy. Let's try another woman in the bedroom. Why? I don't know. You said

1362
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:06,120
their things you wanted to try? No, that's not what I mean. I don't know that. We talked about that

1363
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:15,000
enough, didn't we? If we did, just give me a refresher. No. Yeah, it's okay if I bring another guy.

1364
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,040
I'm sorry. I'm from the 60s. Did it all. Yeah. Sorry, grew up in the air, grew up in the

1365
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:26,040
cities. Yeah, you're fine. We had AIDS. That was fun. That's right. You guys had free love and sex

1366
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:32,600
and we had AIDS. Gee, it was not fun. We just did everything. That sucks. Yeah, flower people,

1367
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:40,120
the flower people did it all. Put your dick in, explode. Go to 11. All right, baby. All right.

1368
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:45,000
Okay. So I thank you for having me. No, it's wonderful to have you. Okay. And I'll make sure you

1369
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,640
have something nice and warm on top of you tonight. Thank you for first. All right, but thanks for listening.
