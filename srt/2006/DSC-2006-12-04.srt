Puzzo

28
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,160
Puzzo

29
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,960
Puzzo

30
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:23,960
But, but, I want to speed up, but, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but I want to speed up, but

32
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:50,640
I want to squeeze your butt, your sexy sexy butt, what do you think I've been doing

33
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
my exercise?

34
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
I noticed.

35
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
Now you do that.

36
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,640
She didn't notice it at all.

37
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,000
Melody Diva is from Australia.

38
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, I love it.

39
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's good, isn't it?

40
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's wonderful.

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I want your butt.

42
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,280
And you can actually buy that through the Pod Save Music Network.

43
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,280
It's good.

44
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,280
I like it.

45
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
Let's see how it ends.

46
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,280
Come on.

47
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,320
Go butt, something like that.

48
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,800
It's a coincidence, because I actually wanted to tell you about the guy that I'm

49
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,280
dancing with right now.

50
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
Oh, yes.

51
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,280
A butt like that.

52
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,040
You're jumping the gun, my dear.

53
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,760
I haven't even properly introduced you.

54
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,760
I know what it's like.

55
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,000
You were thinking about it.

56
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh, no, huh.

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,640
That is 20 years of captivity is what that is.

58
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,760
Hey, everybody.

59
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,400
Welcome to the Daily Source Code episode.

60
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,080
Five.

61
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,080
Would I say 50 or nine or I think it's 508?

62
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Really?

63
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,760
Oh, fuck me.

64
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,320
Yeah, I said 509.

65
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
It's 508.

66
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
OK.

67
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,480
You were ahead of time again.

68
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,280
I had of the times and on top of the news.

69
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,080
I know.

70
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,120
Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand.

71
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:01,440
Finally, in the Curry Cottage studios, the Lady, the Diva, star of silver screen

72
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,880
and microphone, the Lady Patricia.

73
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,360
Hello, darling.

74
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Hello, my dear.

75
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,200
Did I miss you?

76
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
Are you kidding me?

77
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Are you kidding me?

78
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,600
You know, there are hundreds of thousands of people around the world who

79
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,240
want to know one thing right now.

80
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,600
Yeah.

81
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,400
Did the house was it up to standards when you came home?

82
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,840
Was everything in the right place?

83
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,120
Was the checklist completed?

84
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,280
I was, say, I was blown away.

85
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
Yeah.

86
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,040
Everything was right?

87
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,000
You know, I expected everything, I thought, no, you know, I know how they

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,640
clean up for, probably in the closets for those of you who missed the discussion of

89
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
the checklist.

90
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,480
You know, like I was telling the audience that when you go flying, you have a checklist.

91
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,200
And you have to do every single bit of the checklist.

92
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,160
Otherwise, you know, you could have a real bad day.

93
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,200
So I created a checklist for when you come home and all the things have to do every

94
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
single day.

95
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Yeah.

96
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,600
And I did the checklist and it worked.

97
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
I saved my life.

98
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
I'm amazed.

99
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm amazed, really.

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,160
And you know, I hated when I come home and it's a mess and, you know, you're tired.

101
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,120
But no, everything looked fine.

102
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,120
Although this morning, I had a little peek in Christina's closet.

103
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
I wasn't responsible for that.

104
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,480
And it was one big pile.

105
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
I was not responsible.

106
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,080
She threw all her shit in there.

107
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
She threw all her shit in there.

108
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,080
The door.

109
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,080
And jammed it.

110
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
She was sticking there.

111
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,080
So it wouldn't pop open.

112
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,080
Jammed the door.

113
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
And closed it.

114
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
Okay.

115
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,560
Well, I did have a big advantage of today.

116
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
So being here on Friday.

117
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,560
I have to admit, that's a big advantage.

118
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
Yeah.

119
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,400
That really made it a lot easier because we picked up on Saturday.

120
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,600
So, you know, we basically walked around on our socks on tiptoe from Saturday until I

121
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,000
picked you up from Friday after Teresa left.

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And you kept it.

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Just don't touch anything.

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No.

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Every plate we use.

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We washed immediately and just put it right back into the cupboard.

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
True.

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Well, no.

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's so good to have you back, huh?

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And of course.

131
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,120
Later than we actually, uh, yeah, now I have to say I was a perfect general in and not

132
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,160
tell anyone what was going on because you're only supposed to be going for three days.

133
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
Yeah.

134
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,640
And it wound up being five on the six to extra day two and a half extra days.

135
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
Yeah.

136
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:18,520
Six, if you include Saturday, so you were there practicing for dancing with the stars,

137
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,920
which everyone is well aware of.

138
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,680
Now, I just want everyone to know that, uh, while Patricia is doing this,

139
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,520
the entire Dutch pret, let's call them the press core, but of course, it's a paparazzi

140
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,200
and it's trying to get it all over me.

141
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,880
Idiots trying to fill the TV shows are trying to get a hold of you in order to, you

142
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
know, do an interview.

143
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,800
And of course, of course, your people are saying no, but she's not interested.

144
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
She's dancing.

145
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,720
I'm here for dancing and for for this TV show.

146
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,400
And they all wanted to also want me to just be quiet and, you know, leave everything

147
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
to them.

148
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,240
So actually, you're not allowed to say anything.

149
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,800
Well, it's not like they haven't even tried to get to get some interview.

150
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,080
Well, they asked me every time they say, is it are we allowed to tell them this and that?

151
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,040
And then most of the time I say no.

152
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,840
So, of course, uh, necessary.

153
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,640
You being part of the show, uh, we have an exclusive here.

154
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,320
All the news about, uh, your most recent adventure.

155
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,000
What was going on?

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,400
Okay.

157
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,200
Let me tell you.

158
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,800
Okay.

159
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,760
Um, now I have to say this is a very special one because normally,

160
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,560
you're, um, it's longer.

161
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,960
Can I just say I love your lips?

162
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,960
That's a, that's a very pretty color red.

163
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,560
Oh, thank you.

164
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,760
I thought it's almost Christmas.

165
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:32,960
Yeah.

166
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,560
Very nice.

167
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:33,760
Yeah.

168
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,960
Looks very Christmas lips here.

169
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,160
Yeah.

170
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,360
Um, normally you train a little bit longer.

171
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,760
You have to come back every time.

172
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,960
You know, it takes a while.

173
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,760
The whole show.

174
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,360
But this one is a special one.

175
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,760
And that's why I said, yes.

176
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,760
Yeah, this isn't like the two.

177
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,160
Because I have no time to go back.

178
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,880
This is not the two month extravaganza where you have to do like 10 different dances.

179
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,560
You're only doing two different dances, correct?

180
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,160
Right.

181
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
Okay.

182
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,360
It's a special super super celebrity dancing with the stars.

183
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
Yes.

184
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
Of course it is.

185
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,360
Yeah.

186
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
Yeah.

187
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
The very happy are good calls for good calls.

188
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
Yeah.

189
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Well, um, no.

190
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
No.

191
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
I don't really know.

192
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
That's what it calls.

193
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Well, it's for my calls.

194
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
That's good.

195
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,360
Very good calls indeed.

196
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
My dear.

197
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Very good calls.

198
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,360
Because when they called me, I said, you know what?

199
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,760
I haven't done, um, something in a while.

200
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,360
My mom was standing next to me.

201
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,360
Yeah.

202
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
And yeah, she was happy.

203
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,960
And, you know, it was getting dark outside.

204
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,760
I'm not, I wasn't really training.

205
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,160
You are not a winter person.

206
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
I'm not a winter person.

207
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
No.

208
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,760
So normally I would do my walks on the downs, you know, and with the dog or anything.

209
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,160
But now it was not, it's not the way to go outside.

210
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,760
And I have every time I have my excuse, I don't know.

211
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
I'm going outside.

212
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
It's cold.

213
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,760
Right.

214
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,760
So, um, I thought, you know what?

215
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,960
I have something that I can look forwards to and say, I have to train.

216
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
I have to do it.

217
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,160
Because it's for, you know, for this, for the show.

218
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,760
Because if I do, if I say yes, you have to look forwards.

219
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,760
You have to do it.

220
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,760
You've got to kick some ass.

221
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,760
And not just that.

222
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,560
You have to, you're representing the family.

223
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,560
Exactly.

224
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,560
Represent.

225
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
That's the most important.

226
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,360
You're representing, you cannot suck.

227
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
No.

228
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
You don't have to win, but you can't suck.

229
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
You cannot suck.

230
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,760
So my mom's standing next to me, jumping up and down.

231
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,960
You have to do this.

232
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,160
You have to, this is you.

233
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
You have to do this.

234
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,560
And say, mom, let me think for.

235
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
So I said, what did I say?

236
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,760
I said, well,

237
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,960
if you really want to do it for yourself, okay.

238
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,360
But realize that everything is going to come back again.

239
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,360
The press will come and everything's going to happen.

240
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,560
I said, do you handle it?

241
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,560
I said, you said.

242
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
Can you handle this?

243
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Can you handle this?

244
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,360
Can you handle this?

245
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,760
So I thought about it.

246
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,160
I called the girl and I said, you know, why not?

247
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,160
Because I think if somebody has, like me, a heart problem.

248
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,360
I mean, the people in inspiration, my dear.

249
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
That's what I thought.

250
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Exactly.

251
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,360
If I can do this, it's a great boost for myself.

252
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,960
Maybe it's my wings.

253
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,760
I will be an example for other people.

254
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,160
Have a problem, but maybe bigger than I have.

255
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,760
Maybe smaller that we can do, you know, these things.

256
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:08,760
And the only thing is combination of the strengths and the high set

257
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,360
at the dancing.

258
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,760
And you know, because you need a lot of breath for that.

259
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,760
And the combination with being excited and it's a little bit,

260
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,360
let me extrapolate.

261
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,560
Let me extrapolate that.

262
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,560
So with your current heart condition, actually exercise, of course,

263
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,160
is very good.

264
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,360
Dancing, as we know, is a great cardiovascular exercise.

265
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,760
However, your particular issues with your heart,

266
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,560
come upon with stress or form of emotional reaction.

267
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,760
And you have to, yes.

268
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,960
And you have to, you really have to pay attention to your breathing.

269
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,360
So you're, I'm just just playing this on the sidelines here.

270
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,560
So your worry is because of the excitement because it's a show

271
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,560
it's live, it's a contest, all this stuff that you may actually

272
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,560
have a fence.

273
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,560
Hyperventilate in that could force through you into a complete

274
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,560
vomiting spiral.

275
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,560
On live television.

276
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,560
I don't want to make you nervous or anything.

277
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,560
But that's great for the show.

278
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,560
We're not familiar.

279
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,560
No.

280
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,560
It would definitely be good television.

281
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,560
So yeah, so I want to know that.

282
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
And it gives me more strength after that.

283
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,560
And maybe I won't worry that much anymore.

284
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,560
Who knows?

285
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,560
You know, I thought about all those things.

286
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,560
So first of all, it's for me.

287
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,560
So how far, so how far is it?

288
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,560
How is it feeling so far?

289
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
I mean, great.

290
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
Okay.

291
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
I noticed that I'm in great shape.

292
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Oh yeah.

293
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,560
But you know that.

294
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,560
Yes.

295
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,560
And by the way, may I comment on your ass and it's tightness.

296
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,560
It's quite.

297
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,560
I mean, this dancing should not.

298
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,560
Can I hire this Remco guy to come once a week?

299
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
Just dance with you.

300
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,560
That's very good.

301
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,560
Okay.

302
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
So I'm in great shape.

303
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,560
That's no problem at all.

304
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,560
And I can still move my hips.

305
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,560
I get compliments for that.

306
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
It's going very well.

307
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,560
I have to say it's more difficult than I thought.

308
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
It's very difficult.

309
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,560
Yeah.

310
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,560
Because I've never did that before.

311
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560
I'm not a dancer.

312
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,560
Especially not with a partner.

313
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,560
I know my routine and you know.

314
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,560
Right.

315
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Now you're doing the walls and you're doing the.

316
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,560
Samba.

317
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,560
Samba.

318
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,560
Okay.

319
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,560
Yeah.

320
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,560
And so that's the most difficult one.

321
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,560
How do you actually learn that?

322
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,560
I mean, I don't understand.

323
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,560
I don't know where you start.

324
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,560
But in the beginning, you can even say,

325
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
I don't get it.

326
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,560
You just remembering all the different steps.

327
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,560
You have to remember it.

328
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,560
And I was just, you know, hitting my knees against him.

329
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
Because I was doing something.

330
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,560
But I have to listen and follow him.

331
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,560
Wait.

332
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,560
Wait.

333
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,560
Someone else told you you have to listen.

334
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,560
No.

335
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,560
You can't really.

336
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,560
I can't concentrate.

337
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,560
No.

338
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,560
Oh, you're kidding me.

339
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,560
My god.

340
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
These are revelations.

341
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
This is fantastic.

342
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
I can't concentrate.

343
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
I'm so bad.

344
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
If things happen around me.

345
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
Come on.

346
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
So, you know, these are very interesting.

347
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
So, I'm laughing.

348
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,560
I'm laughing.

349
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,560
I'm giggling.

350
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,560
I mean, it's fun.

351
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,560
Until now, it is a lot of fun.

352
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
Because I cannot do it.

353
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
But he's teaching me.

354
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
Now, when you say you can't do it, I don't believe it.

355
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,560
I'm sure you're very helpful.

356
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,560
I have to.

357
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,560
I have to.

358
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
Yeah.

359
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,560
But I am.

360
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,560
I have no idea.

361
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,560
You're basically bullshitting your way through the steps.

362
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,560
I've never.

363
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,560
You know, we always been on the stage and looking at people.

364
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,560
Dancing with each other.

365
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,560
Right.

366
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,560
I was never there.

367
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,560
Not well.

368
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,560
Not this type of dancing.

369
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,560
No.

370
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,560
No.

371
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,560
No.

372
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,560
So, that's different.

373
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,560
That's different.

374
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,560
And the thing is, I, you know, I'm a person that need to be in control.

375
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
I think, you know, all of that.

376
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,560
Oh, let me think of, ever noticed that hat.

377
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,560
I said, it's very hard to let somebody else be in control.

378
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
So, that's my biggest problem.

379
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,560
Listeners, do you hear now what, now you hear it from someone else?

380
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,560
What kind of for 20 years have been locked into this?

381
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,560
Well, thank God.

382
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,560
I'm in control here.

383
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,560
Well, that's true.

384
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,560
Yes.

385
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
You're so out of control.

386
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,560
Oh, boom.

387
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,560
All right.

388
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,560
So, so you've been doing this for several weeks now.

389
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,560
And you had to do this in another training session.

390
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,560
Yeah.

391
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,560
And you were supposed to actually be back today and do another training session.

392
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,560
For me, it's a little bit more difficult because I live in England.

393
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,560
Yes.

394
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,560
And you're not going to stay there.

395
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,560
You husband can't always fly you back for.

396
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,560
You're in in America.

397
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,560
So, I have to be here with my child and my dog and my cats and my house.

398
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,560
So, you know, I cannot just leave it just like that.

399
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,560
So, what we do is Remco is his name.

400
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,560
He is a world.

401
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,560
Now, he's not a national champion dancer.

402
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,560
So, that's good.

403
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,560
Yeah, yeah.

404
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,560
He comes to England and we did a couple of rehearsals and went to Holland and everything.

405
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,560
But what happened?

406
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:35,560
So, we're a little bit behind of the other contestants because he got a good poisoning.

407
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,560
Oh, that's right.

408
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,560
Yeah.

409
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,560
Yeah.

410
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,560
That was like a three-day ordeal.

411
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
Yeah.

412
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,560
You know how that that takes a while, especially for your.

413
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,560
What is it?

414
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,560
Your physique and I think.

415
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,560
So, an energy.

416
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,560
There's no energy left.

417
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,560
So, that was that.

418
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,560
That was first.

419
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,560
Then a couple of days ago.

420
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,560
I'm falling off of a chair.

421
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,560
It was like that.

422
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,560
Hold on a second.

423
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,560
You fell off a chair.

424
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,560
I fell off a chair.

425
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,560
Just like that.

426
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,560
Just like that.

427
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
I was laughing.

428
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
You know how.

429
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Where was this?

430
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,560
Where was this?

431
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,560
Where was this?

432
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
The rehearsal.

433
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,560
You were sitting on a chair and you fell off.

434
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
How did that happen?

435
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
You can't have just fell off of the chair.

436
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,560
Well, if the legs just went to the back and.

437
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Were you tipping on your chair?

438
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,560
Well, I was.

439
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
Were you tipping on your chair?

440
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
Well, I was.

441
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
You were tipping on your chair.

442
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,560
You were tipping on your chair.

443
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,560
And just slide it away.

444
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,560
And I ended up on my bum.

445
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,560
Really, really hard.

446
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
So that hurt.

447
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,560
But in the right side of my body.

448
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,560
Fell on another chair.

449
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,560
But that was okay.

450
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,560
Because you know, I'm a talk girl.

451
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,560
And I do crazy things in the house.

452
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,560
And I'm falling and sliding.

453
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
You're always slamming your bum on something.

454
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
I know.

455
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,560
I'm hitting a lot here in the house.

456
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
So no problem.

457
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,560
So I stood up and started dancing.

458
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,560
But every time he grabbed me in my waist, I thought,

459
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,560
Oh, my God.

460
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,560
It's like a crack to rip or anything.

461
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,560
You know, but didn't pay any attention.

462
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,560
And two days later, I still had money.

463
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
Excuse me.

464
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,560
And I'm not pouring you or anything.

465
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
No.

466
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,560
I had a burr.

467
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,560
Okay.

468
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
Well, yes.

469
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,560
I've heard the story.

470
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,560
You know, yeah.

471
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,560
Okay.

472
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,560
And then I got this horrible pain when I came home.

473
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,560
Because I'm staying at your father's house.

474
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
And my sister's house.

475
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,560
In the middle of the night, a wake-up.

476
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,560
Sweating like crazy.

477
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,560
No.

478
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,560
I mean, I was crawling in the bed.

479
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,560
I was so in pain.

480
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
I've never...

481
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,560
I thought, I had, you know, I got a baby or anything.

482
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,560
It was this your heart?

483
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,560
It was delivering a baby.

484
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,560
I don't know.

485
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
Didn't feel like your heart was there something wrong with your heart?

486
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,560
No, not at all.

487
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,560
It was all down there on the right hand side of your...

488
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,560
So I wanted to get out of the bed.

489
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,560
And then I don't know it anymore.

490
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,560
It was one big bang.

491
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,560
I was on the floor.

492
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,560
And the phone came up.

493
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,560
And I probably passed out.

494
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,560
Oh, no.

495
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,560
It was one.

496
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,560
And then when I came, it was one.

497
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,560
That was it.

498
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,560
And I said, you've only, you know, I have to go back to bed.

499
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
And I take a couple of aspirins.

500
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,560
And I probably...

501
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,560
You do such a trooper.

502
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,560
You know, I don't want to be.

503
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,560
You know how?

504
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,560
I don't want to believe it.

505
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,560
This is not true.

506
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,560
I'm going to go back really.

507
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,560
You don't say.

508
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,560
So I'm going back to bed.

509
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,560
And it started again.

510
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,560
And it got even worse.

511
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,560
And I was...

512
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,560
Was this like a shark?

513
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,560
What?

514
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,560
If you want to throw up?

515
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,560
So the pain was so bad that it made you actually vomit?

516
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,560
Yeah.

517
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,560
Oh, no.

518
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,560
So bad.

519
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,560
That's really bad.

520
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,560
No, no.

521
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,560
No, we are a non-puking household.

522
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,560
We don't.

523
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
We don't.

524
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
We just don't do it.

525
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
Literally not.

526
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,560
So we can help.

527
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,560
I passed out again.

528
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,560
And he falls.

529
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,560
That's it.

530
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,560
I'm going to call an ambulance.

531
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,560
Hold on a second.

532
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,560
You didn't tell the story exactly right.

533
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,560
You come on man.

534
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
You were like Elvis.

535
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,560
Come on.

536
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,560
Come on man.

537
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,560
I want the most part.

538
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,560
What is a person doing when you don't feel well, especially in your...

539
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
I'll tell you.

540
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
I know.

541
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,560
If I could only take a good shit, it would all be over.

542
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,560
I'll be this.

543
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,560
Okay.

544
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,560
Maybe I'll...

545
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,560
If I go to the bathroom.

546
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
To the bathroom.

547
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
You know.

548
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,560
Take a shit.

549
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
Maybe there's a trap.

550
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,560
Oh.

551
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,560
So.

552
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,560
And then you...

553
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,560
And you fainted on the door.

554
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,560
I'm afraid.

555
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Eating a big Mac.

556
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,560
Let the ketchup.

557
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,560
I'm afraid.

558
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,560
You said the next thing.

559
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,560
Did you do an Elvis?

560
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,560
Ha ha ha ha.

561
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,560
Right.

562
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,560
So you've...

563
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,560
You've on...

564
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
There's a middle of the night.

565
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,560
So you've on called the hospital.

566
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Yeah.

567
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,560
If you call the ambulance, because the hospital is very nearby.

568
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,560
So what they do is they sent a doctor first.

569
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,560
You know?

570
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,560
Because ambulance is very busy.

571
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,560
They have this national health care, by the way.

572
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,560
You can tell that they actually sent someone out.

573
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
How long did it take before they came?

574
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,560
Oh.

575
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
It was in about 10 minutes.

576
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,560
Dr.

577
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
And a nurse.

578
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,560
Fantastic.

579
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,560
So when they walked into the go like, oh my god, it's Patricia Pi.

580
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,560
Or were you not paying attention?

581
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,560
Oh, she noticed.

582
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
Yeah.

583
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,560
She noticed right away.

584
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
And was the nurse a woman?

585
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,560
Yes.

586
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,560
Yeah.

587
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,560
She was a men nurse and a doctor.

588
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,560
And what they looked like was a woman.

589
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,560
She looks pretty good in that.

590
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,560
Even without the makeup.

591
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
Yeah.

592
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Are they weren't doing that?

593
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,560
No.

594
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,560
No.

595
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,560
I don't even know.

596
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Of course you know they weren't.

597
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,560
No.

598
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
No.

599
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
I wasn't even thinking about that.

600
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,560
Okay.

601
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
So what did they say?

602
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,560
Well, and then she gave me injection in my thigh.

603
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,560
And she said, this is a sort of a bomb.

604
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,560
A bomb?

605
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Yeah.

606
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
Bomb.

607
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,560
And so you will not be impaying for the next hour.

608
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
So that was nice.

609
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,560
That was nice.

610
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,560
And but the pain just kept on going.

611
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,560
But she said, you have to go to the hospital the next day and check out.

612
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,560
So they didn't know what it was at that point.

613
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,560
Well, she said, I think looking at your urine and everything.

614
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,560
There's blood in it.

615
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
It's your blood in your urine.

616
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,560
Yeah.

617
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
So it was my kidney.

618
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,560
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

619
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
It was my kidney.

620
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,560
So there was the first doctor.

621
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,560
And the next day, I had other doctors in the hospital saying,

622
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,560
It was a kidney stone.

623
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,560
Oh, wait a minute.

624
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,560
How did it go?

625
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,560
So what I understood is that this could.

626
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,560
And I know, because we had 700 employees at our last company.

627
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,560
And I have actually seen this happen.

628
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,560
Young people as well.

629
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,560
Yeah.

630
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,560
Who all of a sudden, it's not really necessarily kidney stone.

631
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,560
But it's like, you know, little bits and pieces.

632
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,560
And they can dislodge.

633
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,560
And I've seen people lying in the pool.

634
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,560
Well, you've seen people lying in the pool.

635
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,560
Wait a minute.

636
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
Let me say it.

637
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,560
I've seen people laying in a pile of people.

638
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,560
I know.

639
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,560
You know, passed out in the bathroom because of the pain.

640
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,560
I mean, it's really, really bad.

641
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,560
Yeah.

642
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,560
So it's not like you have kidney stones.

643
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,560
There's like some dust or something that got dislodged or something.

644
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,560
It can be so small.

645
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,560
And you know, lots of people.

646
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:28,560
They say one out of three people have this.

647
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,560
They actually, everybody has a little bit of that in your kidneys.

648
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,560
Because that's what the kidneys do.

649
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,560
Yeah.

650
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,560
But sometimes because of a blow or an accident, you know, something that happens.

651
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,560
They get dislodged.

652
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,560
Or for instance, if they start to travel a little bit.

653
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,560
Or for instance, in like four weeks, if you were moving, moving house.

654
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,560
Yeah.

655
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,560
Could have happened.

656
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,560
Should have happened then.

657
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
Okay.

658
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,560
So it could, it would have happened anyway.

659
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
That's what they all said.

660
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,560
So because I thought, oh, I'm good now.

661
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
I'm dancing.

662
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,560
And so what do they do for that?

663
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,560
What are they?

664
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,560
Oh, they gave me a little bit of a medicine and a painkiller.

665
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,560
And they asked me to keep five days of rest.

666
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,560
And then see how I feel.

667
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,560
If it's stay is still there.

668
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,560
You have to go back to the hospital.

669
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,560
And maybe they can help you destroy the distance.

670
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,560
But it's going very well.

671
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,560
Since you're on the show, I presume that it's going very well.

672
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,560
It's going very well.

673
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,560
It's still a little bit.

674
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,560
That's lingering on the pain.

675
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,560
But.

676
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,560
So of course you couldn't travel.

677
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,560
I mean, you had commercial airline tickets booked now.

678
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,560
You had to cancel.

679
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,560
But you couldn't even actually.

680
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,560
No.

681
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,560
I mean, there was no way we're going to let the diva walk alone and in pain through

682
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,560
a through course.

683
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,560
There was an awful lot.

684
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,560
Wonderful.

685
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,560
Yeah.

686
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,560
You picked me up.

687
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
Captain Dan and I came.

688
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,560
And it was not the best of weather Saturday.

689
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,560
I'll have you know.

690
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,560
I didn't even care.

691
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,560
I didn't even care.

692
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,560
No.

693
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,560
I know you didn't.

694
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,560
I wanted to be airlifted and go.

695
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,560
Well, that's exactly what we did.

696
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,560
But then it was.

697
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,560
That was a fun trip for us.

698
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,560
It was.

699
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
Yeah.

700
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
It was not easy.

701
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,560
But you picked me up.

702
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,560
We ran some shit weather over the channel.

703
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,560
That's for sure.

704
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
I just wanted to be in my own bed.

705
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,560
My own house.

706
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,560
But it's going very well.

707
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,560
And and Remko and my dance partner is calling me every time.

708
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,560
Because he's afraid that you're going to cancel.

709
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,560
Yeah.

710
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
So, you know, how is everything going?

711
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,560
But everything's going well.

712
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,560
So, now you are behind.

713
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,560
I'm behind.

714
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,560
Absolutely.

715
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,560
Can you catch up, you think?

716
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,560
Never.

717
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,560
But it doesn't matter.

718
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
The pro.

719
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,560
I'm a pro.

720
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,560
You'll figure something out.

721
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,560
Show, we'll go on.

722
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,560
Show, musko on.

723
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,560
And Remko will be here next week.

724
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,560
And this week.

725
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,560
I mean, and well, we'll dance a little bit.

726
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,560
Because, of course, I'm going tomorrow.

727
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
Unless you don't feel good enough.

728
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,560
Then I'll stay.

729
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,560
But if you feel okay.

730
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,560
But the good part is.

731
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,560
Roxie, Christina's.

732
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,560
Of course, you know, my sister's daughter.

733
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,560
She was, she wanted to come with me every time.

734
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,560
And I thought, why?

735
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,560
Hold on one second.

736
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,560
Those of you who are listening to us on serious stars.

737
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,560
One, two, if you want to hear why Roxie wanted to come along.

738
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
You got to go to www.damesourcego.com.

739
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,560
And she's over 20.

740
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,560
And she's seen the show.

741
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,560
So she knows how the dancer looks.

742
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,560
My dancer.

743
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,560
And she is with mouth open.

744
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,560
She's going to look staring at his behind.

745
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Because this guy has the good.

746
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,560
And that's why he was so funny.

747
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,560
You were playing this song.

748
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
Oh, okay.

749
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,560
Because this guy has the greatest.

750
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,560
He's got a good ass.

751
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,560
Tied.

752
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
Beautiful.

753
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,560
When do I get to meet as well?

754
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,560
I want to eat Mr. Ass.

755
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,560
You've ever.

756
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,560
I mean, he's not gay.

757
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
So it's lovely.

758
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,560
Should I be worried?

759
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,560
Or is everything okay?

760
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
Should you be where?

761
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,560
Look at your body.

762
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,560
Oh, yes.

763
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,560
Do you see what I have?

764
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,560
I'm sorry.

765
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,560
I mean, why go for hamburgers when you have this steak at home, right?

766
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,560
Yeah.

767
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,560
We can't even better that.

768
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,560
Filming your baby.

769
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,560
That's it.

770
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,560
Wow.

771
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
What a story.

772
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,560
That is quite a story.

773
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,560
Now, of course, I didn't say anything on the show because I, you know, the last thing

774
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,560
we wanted is, you know, like, tabloids picking up a, you know, like, a hope of

775
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,560
Trisha.

776
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
Yeah.

777
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,560
It doesn't sound right.

778
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
That didn't keep me.

779
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
Oh, it sounds so old.

780
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
You know, women don't want that.

781
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,560
No, of course, women don't want that.

782
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
No, of course, women don't want that.

783
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,560
No, men, you know, that cancel concerts and everybody needs to know.

784
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,560
We don't like that.

785
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
No.

786
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,560
But this morning, I got the call that they're looking for me.

787
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
And they're the magazines already, right?

788
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,560
Well, because someone saw you in the hospital, probably.

789
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,560
Exactly.

790
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,560
And it's not that cool.

791
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,560
Amazing.

792
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,560
How people will then call a gossip magazine.

793
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
And you don't.

794
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,560
You know, I'm seeing you in a hospital.

795
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,560
Yeah.

796
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,560
I know.

797
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,560
I know.

798
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,560
So that's why here it is.

799
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,560
This is the story.

800
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,560
Wow.

801
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
Yeah.

802
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,560
Okay.

803
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,560
Wow.

804
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
Wow.

805
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,560
I'm blown away by this.

806
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,560
Damn.

807
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
You know, myself.

808
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
Cook.

809
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,560
Yeah.

810
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
I know you are, baby.

811
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,560
Yeah.

812
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,560
Wait a minute.

813
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,560
You want it.

814
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,560
Hey.

815
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,560
You have some some voice mail feedback from one of your biggest fans.

816
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,560
And do that here.

817
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:42,560
You've been a bad boy.

818
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
What are you talking about?

819
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,560
With this girl.

820
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,560
Oh, Jesus.

821
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,560
I got a, I want to talk about that in a second.

822
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
Being a bad boy.

823
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
Yeah.

824
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,560
First this.

825
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
Hold on.

826
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,560
Okay.

827
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
Why didn't that work?

828
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,560
Come in.

829
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,560
Come in.

830
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,560
Come in.

831
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,560
Come in.

832
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
Come in.

833
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,560
Come in.

834
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,560
Come in.

835
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,560
Come in.

836
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,560
Come in.

837
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,560
Come in.

838
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,560
Come in.

839
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
Come in.

840
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
Come in.

841
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,560
Okay.

842
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Pay attention.

843
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,560
For you.

844
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Yeah.

845
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
I'm carry.

846
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,560
I have a message to your wife.

847
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,560
Patricia Pai.

848
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
So Patricia.

849
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,560
Just listen to me.

850
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,560
Of course.

851
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,560
I wish you getting well soon.

852
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,560
And good health.

853
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:29,560
hereby to do some things because I see the two squander your life or what is left of it.

854
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:38,920
Patricia, to save your soul, yourself, please do the funneling. Point number one, forget about

855
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:45,800
stupid Netherlands and the dancing competitions and others stupid Dutch things. Just pretend

856
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:55,320
that these Dutch idiots don't exist. Point number two, Patricia, please resume your singing career.

857
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:03,400
But this time, focus holy on UK and USA. Create new songs. I repeat clearly, new new new

858
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:11,800
music. Look at it, new new and create them yourself, all in cooperation with Braids and Americans.

859
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:18,680
But no Dutch allowed. Have you read these songs on the internet, passionately on iTunes and

860
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:25,800
passionately on post-set music network of your husband. Point three, point number three, never stop

861
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:36,280
singing. Sing to your last breath. I'm singing. Sing till your last breath. I thought that was

862
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:45,080
so funny. I don't see now that I don't know. This is why I love them on the show because

863
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:54,440
I mean, he's opinionated and a little rougher on the edges, but he's smart. So you love that,

864
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:00,920
don't you? I thought that we had done this on the show, but apparently I just, I don't

865
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:08,040
talk about it. That I'd played you the Jeff Smith new Christmas song. And I hadn't told you

866
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:12,200
who it was. And I said, who do who is this? And you said, oh, that's Jeff Smith. And I said, yeah, you're right.

867
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,760
And you said, I'd love to do a song like that with Jeff Smith. I wouldn't mind doing the

868
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,520
duet and we could, you know, record you part here. So I talked about that. That's what, of course,

869
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:26,840
where comics were blogger tapped into it. But Jeff actually, of course, he immediately created a song.

870
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:33,240
And yes, yeah, no, you're hooked now, baby. So I thought it would be a fun idea. And I

871
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,760
cleared it with Jeff as long as I really disclamed it. I haven't played this for you. I haven't

872
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,640
played the track yet. I've had it for a couple days. I want to play it for you now. Now, this is a demo,

873
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:49,800
a capital DMO. Okay. So Jeff is actually, you know, the track isn't there. The horns aren't there.

874
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:54,520
You know, none of that is completely done. I don't know anything about songwriting. I have my

875
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:01,080
own opinion. Oh, yeah. I mean, I know you. My famous song, if you know how they started and how they

876
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,880
sounded in the beginning is very different, right? So I thought it would be really fun to take the

877
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:11,080
creative process online and do this now in the show. Okay. Have you listened to the track?

878
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,480
Now, Jeff is also singing your part. So, you know, you're not allowed to laugh. But it's just

879
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:21,160
for the idea. Well, listen to the song. And then, you know, you could pull it apart and give

880
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,680
your opinion. Okay. It's called you better thing twice. And it is a demo

881
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,240
by the fabulous Jeff Smith.

882
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:57,720
I can feel it's just a matter of time before you chatting me up with the usual.

883
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:03,560
Well, if you think you get my love and after the drop of the hat, your better thing twice.

884
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:10,600
Your better thing twice. If you're thinking wrong, that's just simple as that. Your better thing twice.

885
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:17,480
Your better thing twice. You could add it up through the map however you like. But one and one together,

886
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:25,080
but it's still ain't right. I appreciate the awful book now. He'd my advice. You better think twice with me.

887
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:33,400
There's something we could go in on in your mind. I could see you on it, but I'm not that blind.

888
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:40,760
Playing a cool white side, you're a blaze. Yeah, I say it on with that hopeless gaze.

889
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:47,400
Don't try to hide us all the way in your eye. Yes, I know you're waiting for your drink to arrive.

890
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,840
Well, maybe if you're thirsty let me put it this way. I don't play that game.

891
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:58,520
That's so cliche. Well, if you think you get my love and after the drop of the hat,

892
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:05,320
your better thing twice. Your better thing twice. If you think you're thinking wrong, that's just simple as that.

893
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:12,760
Well, you better think twice. You ain't no roll of the dice. You could add it up through the map however you like.

894
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:19,880
But one and one together, it's still ain't right. I appreciate the awful book now. He'd my advice.

895
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:26,920
Your better thing twice with me. But then the band started pumping. The whole room was jumping,

896
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:32,120
and at a moment we were on on the floor. A condoled fate over the weather,

897
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:37,240
but we ended up together. The trumpet's hide is bagged for more. Yeah.

898
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:57,000
Hey, what was your name? You don't move so bad. I like the way you swing.

899
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,280
Hey, how about that? You look calm and crazy. I think I was wrong.

900
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:11,320
It's probably better this way on second thought. Hey, what if you think you get my love and after the drop of the hat?

901
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:18,200
Your better thing twice. Your better thing twice. If you think you're wrong, that's just simple as that.

902
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:25,720
Well, your better thing twice. Don't be cool as dice. We're in the stars and I'm on all the moon. It's just bad.

903
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:32,520
My big better than you thought. Oh, it might be so nice. Sega time around might just be all right.

904
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:38,920
So your better thing twice. Oh, better thing twice. Yeah, your better thing twice with me.

905
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,120
I want to give it another go.

906
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:51,000
In comparable Jeff Smith with the demo of you better thing twice. Okay. So what did you think?

907
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:58,360
Yeah, it's it's yeah. I like it. You got to be honest because otherwise it won't work, right?

908
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:04,760
And not Jeff is amazing. I'm crazy about the course. Not special enough because the beginning

909
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:12,280
you expect a little bit more and you think here it is. It's really going to open up.

910
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:22,360
It's really going to be open up and wow. What a great melody. But then the melody of the chorus is not as strong as the

911
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,440
first. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay. Let me just let me see you going to find out.

912
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:33,400
Yeah, here's the chorus. Yeah. You better think twice. You better think twice. Yeah.

913
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:40,760
There's a little bit of a line. But one and one together, but it's still in right. I have three

914
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:50,680
she's your normal. It's a normal. It's a bit too much of a, it's too much of a mess there. A little bit

915
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:56,040
messy in the chorus. Yeah. Okay. But I kind of like you can do and then do the math and then and then I kind of

916
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:02,280
like that. That that's all right. I mean, I'm not a musician. I'm just a disco jockey. It's not as promising as

917
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:09,480
you think it's promising. It's promising something, but it's not, you know? So the chorus needs to

918
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,400
need to be more promising. Now this by the way is the way records are made, right? I mean that you,

919
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,480
you'll hear a song and you'll talk it over with the producer and with your, the other musicians.

920
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:23,000
That's seeing this, this process. I mean, it has a lot to, it needs to open up a little bit more

921
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,680
and something special need to start there. Okay. And but the whole idea, but the song, I love it. Yeah.

922
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,800
I like that. I think your voices will sound nice together, too. Don't you think? Yeah, I think so too.

923
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,560
You can be really good. Yeah. You'll kill on the right key and what key do you need?

924
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:48,200
Garage key, dorky. They're all these key. R key. Whatever key you want, baby. I'm here to facilitate.

925
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:53,480
I know, figure it out. Sometimes, you know, depends on what kind of work you have, what is

926
00:35:54,120 --> 00:36:02,120
what feels good. You sometimes, it's, it's one song is different than the other, so. Of course. Of course.

927
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,480
Okay. And be it old and now. Okay. So Jeff needs to work work on it now with those comments.

928
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,080
I'm sure he'll have something back to you in like a day and a half. He's so fast. But of course,

929
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,960
I'm going to be in San Francisco so we won't be able to do anything for like a week and a half.

930
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:19,160
Does matter. But I can't wait to do this. But does it need to be, is that a Christmas song? No, no, it's

931
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:24,920
nice. It's just a jazzy. It's on me. It's a very jazzy vibe. Very naughty jazzy song.

932
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:31,080
Let's be kind of naughty. Okay. I don't know who this is, but stop fucking calling to Sally at home.

933
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,480
What did you do now? I told you about all that. I told you that that girl kept calling up in the

934
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:42,040
she came to San Francisco. Yeah. Luckily, I didn't run into her or that guy who called. Yeah.

935
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:47,560
So she's back. I think she's out of the picture. That was pretty scary. Yeah. Scary, man.

936
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:53,160
I mean, not scary, but it's like, I kept saying, don't come to San Francisco and she came to San Francisco.

937
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,320
Yeah, be careful. But everyone started jumping on the stop fucking calling jazell thing.

938
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,720
And I just got to play a couple of different ones for you. I got a lot of really good ones. Here's

939
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:07,880
Angie B of the chill cast. Hey, I don't know who jazell is, but stop fucking calling Adam Curry.

940
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,400
Wow. Well, Angie loves me, man. Yeah. Angie's my-

941
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:19,400
As I can hear. And she's my girlfriend. She's got a great voice. So while I was holding the very

942
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,280
tight ass, you were doing this. Uh-huh. Oh, and it even gets better. And I was worried about-

943
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,680
Oh, what you were worried about? I was so worried about you. What are you doing?

944
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,560
No, I didn't- I know. I was- see that. I'm afraid now that I'm falling off the stool.

945
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,640
Just sit tight and listen to this. I don't know who this is, but stop fucking

946
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:47,320
using sugar and start using splendor. Here's one that'll totally blow your way.

947
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:02,040
But stay spent with the outlating and the Alfred- Doots' on-trends, in the data that Lechandani's

948
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:07,080
Randeo, we're going to go in for a week. Yeah, okay. So this is my old radio show in Holland

949
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:18,760
From my 1980-33. Oh, ma'am, it's still quite long, actually. It's probably still long.

950
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,160
Oh, beeno. Crocadilles.

951
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,800
The get- hear and rom black crocodile match.

952
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,800
Roda, oh yes!

953
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,800
I don't know who this is, but stop fucking taking the piss out of that crocodile's asshole.

954
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,800
I'm telling you, man.

955
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,800
You know that I didn't even recognize your voice.

956
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,800
Well, it was also 25 years ago, my dad.

957
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,800
And in Dutch, you've sound so different in Dutch.

958
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,800
Yeah, I do.

959
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,800
There's, uh, there's one more you got.

960
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,800
So mature now and so rising.

961
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,800
Hey Adam, it's Paul Durham from Black Lab.

962
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,800
Thanks to you guys for the Podsake Music Network.

963
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,800
And all the podcasters who have been playing our stuff this year.

964
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,800
You guys are real.

965
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,800
You are leading the independent digital revolution and we are psyched to be a part of it.

966
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,800
Today I am happy to announce the first of a few goodies that we have in store for the podsphere.

967
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,800
Few months back I went down to Houston to shoot the first Black Lab video since major label days.

968
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,800
The video is for the song Lonely Boy.

969
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,800
Our latest single from our album See The Sun.

970
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,800
Since podcasting has been so integral to our distribution this year,

971
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,800
since both radio and MTV are, like, dead.

972
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,800
I figured the first place people should see the video is on podshow.com.

973
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,800
So check it out there and then come visit us at blacklabworld.com.

974
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,800
Adam, do me a favor.

975
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,800
Stop calling, Jiselle, asshole.

976
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,800
I get away with money.

977
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:02,800
You know I've paid for it and somewhere I can't believe it.

978
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:10,800
Do you feel something when you back in the sea?

979
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,800
Something you want to see again.

980
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,800
I could be the one.

981
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,800
I could make it out to you.

982
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,800
Take me back.

983
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,800
I'm lonely boy.

984
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
I love you.

985
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,800
You say,

986
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,800
My broken heart becomes real I say,

987
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,800
I tell it she'd tell you you say,

988
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,800
I still rap all the lies I've told you,

989
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:03,800
10 dollar bills and smoke and money doesn't burn so clean.

990
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Do you feel something when you back in the sea?

991
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,800
Something you want to see again.

992
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,800
I could be the one.

993
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,800
I could make it out to you.

994
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,800
Take me back.

995
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,800
I'm lonely boy.

996
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
I love you.

997
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800
You say,

998
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,800
My broken heart becomes real I say,

999
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,800
I'm lonely boy.

1000
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,800
You say,

1001
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,800
My broken heart becomes real I say,

1002
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,800
I tell it she'd tell you you say,

1003
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,800
I still rap all the lies I've told you,

1004
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,800
I tell it she'd tell you you say,

1005
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,800
I still don't want to see again.

1006
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:13,800
I could make it out to you.

1007
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,800
Take me back.

1008
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,800
I'm lonely boy.

1009
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,800
You say,

1010
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,800
My broken heart becomes real I say,

1011
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,800
I'm lonely boy.

1012
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:35,800
Let's see.

1013
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,800
Black Lab.

1014
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,800
Lonely Boy.

1015
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,800
I think the video premieres tomorrow on podshow.com.

1016
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,800
No worlds.

1017
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,800
It's a planetary premiere.

1018
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,800
We used to say it.

1019
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,800
I'm TV.

1020
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,800
Radio and MTV are so dead.

1021
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,800
These guys get it, you know?

1022
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,800
They really...

1023
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,800
They are so like dead.

1024
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,800
Even Christina is now out telling bands to go on the podshow music network.

1025
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,800
You guys aren't rocking if you're on the podshow music network.

1026
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,800
Because you get your shit played.

1027
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,800
Exactly.

1028
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,800
Yeah.

1029
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,800
So, you know, I always think I would love to do a show like this with you.

1030
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,800
Just this be the show.

1031
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,800
It would be so nice.

1032
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,800
But first of all, I think it's too hard to coordinate to do it every day.

1033
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,800
You know what the real problem is with a daily source code.

1034
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,800
I get a format going and then I've got a whole bunch of stuff to talk about and stuff to do.

1035
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,800
And you guys can pay me.

1036
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,800
That's a big problem.

1037
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,800
Come here.

1038
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,800
I'll give you my big schmons, baby.

1039
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,800
Then you'll own me.

1040
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,800
You'll own me.

1041
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,800
She wants.

1042
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,800
What are all these pictures from Britney Spears?

1043
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,800
I cannot believe it.

1044
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,800
No.

1045
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,800
You know, I can't believe it.

1046
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,800
They're not hers.

1047
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,800
What do you mean?

1048
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,800
That's not her part of her version.

1049
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,800
Her version.

1050
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,800
Of course it is.

1051
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,800
Of course it is.

1052
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,800
What do you know what they can do with pictures?

1053
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,800
Yeah.

1054
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,800
And if it was like that.

1055
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,800
No.

1056
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,800
Really, you know, her vagina.

1057
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,800
Yes.

1058
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,800
Because pictures of her, you know, part of her body.

1059
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:05,800
If I were her, I would say, you know, sorry, but this is not, these are not my lips.

1060
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,800
I showed you pictures.

1061
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,800
I showed you pictures.

1062
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,800
She can say.

1063
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,800
I showed Patricia the pictures yesterday.

1064
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,800
And you were shocked, I think.

1065
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,800
You were absolutely shocked.

1066
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,800
I would be so shocked and so embarrassing.

1067
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,800
But you know, it's.

1068
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,800
I think it's.

1069
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
I don't really know what it is.

1070
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,800
First of all, I really don't care.

1071
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,800
I mean, it doesn't turn me on.

1072
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,800
It doesn't do anything for me.

1073
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,800
Of course I took a look.

1074
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,800
I can't, I can't help but look.

1075
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
But I like it.

1076
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,800
So whatever.

1077
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,800
It's for her.

1078
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,800
You know, it's Britney Spears is very famous.

1079
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,800
She has to go on with her.

1080
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,800
So the female body is a beautiful thing.

1081
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,800
No matter what part of her.

1082
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,800
I know.

1083
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,800
But this is, it's all your lady.

1084
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,800
You don't do that.

1085
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,800
Yeah, but she's, I don't think she's showing that.

1086
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,800
But she's not showing it on purpose.

1087
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,800
She's stupid.

1088
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,800
No, she's stupid.

1089
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,800
She's out there thinking, you know, she's out partying with Paris,

1090
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,800
Hild, and in Los Angeles.

1091
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,800
And they're just not wearing panties.

1092
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,800
It's the thing of the day.

1093
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,800
Well, you know, I, I did that a couple of times.

1094
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,800
But then underneath a long dress, you know, that you couldn't wear any underwear.

1095
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,800
So they never saw your beef.

1096
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:08,800
So you have your, your panty hose or thing under it.

1097
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,800
And you cannot wear anything like a g string or anything.

1098
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,800
Right.

1099
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,800
But long long long long long.

1100
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,800
Long long long.

1101
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,800
But long.

1102
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,800
But this, this doesn't make any sense.

1103
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,800
Long dresses are not in fashion and it's because they're getting out of the car.

1104
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,800
That's the problem whenever they get out of the car.

1105
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,800
But she knows she has to get out of the car.

1106
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,800
She does now.

1107
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,800
Maybe she likes to win blue.

1108
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,800
The wind blowing there.

1109
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,800
I don't know.

1110
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,800
I don't get it.

1111
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,800
I don't see the.

1112
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,800
Now.

1113
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,800
Well, maybe.

1114
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,800
I hope not when your fame is not when you're stepping out of the car.

1115
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,800
Not when you know there's just not.

1116
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,800
It's just not.

1117
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,800
It's like the Geneva convention.

1118
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,800
You want to go on with your career?

1119
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,800
I don't know.

1120
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,800
You think this is going to hurt a career?

1121
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,800
I don't think it's going to hurt a career.

1122
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:51,800
One thing she can do is say, listen, you may, you might think this is my my vagina.

1123
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,800
Oh, but it's not.

1124
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,800
This is not a part of my body.

1125
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,800
No, I listen.

1126
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,800
I'm going to tell you.

1127
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,800
It's different.

1128
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,800
She has to compensate for the lack of fucking talent.

1129
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,800
She's got no talent.

1130
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,800
So she's going to do something.

1131
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,800
People with talent don't do these things.

1132
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,800
Yeah.

1133
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,800
People with talent.

1134
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,800
Exactly.

1135
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,800
Don't need to do these things.

1136
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,800
Don't even go need to go out and party.

1137
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,800
No.

1138
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,800
Like it's 1999.

1139
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,800
Yeah.

1140
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,800
It's just not necessary.

1141
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,800
Paul Paparazzi don't call the press.

1142
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,800
It's not necessary.

1143
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,800
She has no talent.

1144
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,800
And that's what she does.

1145
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,800
And you know, and of course we're all obsessed with it.

1146
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,800
And it's more important than any other news going on in the world.

1147
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,800
Which all with his bothers me tremendously.

1148
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,800
Where's this going to?

1149
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,800
I think God.

1150
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:34,800
You know, years and years ago, you, you know, they had respect for these sort of things.

1151
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:40,800
You didn't see any Sofia Lauren, you know, in a baby suit where her butt hangs out.

1152
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,800
Nobody would ever do that.

1153
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,800
You know, you just didn't do that.

1154
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,800
Right.

1155
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,800
So times change.

1156
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,800
We used to have steam engines, you know.

1157
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,800
Things change.

1158
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,800
Things change.

1159
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,800
It doesn't bother me.

1160
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,800
I am.

1161
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,800
I think we need to get over it already.

1162
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,800
Okay.

1163
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,800
So it wasn't, you know what?

1164
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,800
I'm embarrassed when I see that.

1165
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,800
And let me tell you.

1166
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,800
Let me tell you.

1167
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,800
Should you be embarrassed?

1168
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,800
Because it wasn't really pretty.

1169
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,800
That's what no.

1170
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,800
That's what she should be embarrassed about.

1171
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,800
Yeah.

1172
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,800
Wasn't her young girl?

1173
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,800
Yeah.

1174
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,800
It doesn't look very appetizing.

1175
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,800
Oh, man.

1176
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,800
Yeah.

1177
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,800
They're entire days that I think.

1178
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,800
Okay.

1179
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,800
Wow.

1180
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,800
So anyway, getting back to it.

1181
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,800
It's out of my system now.

1182
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,800
Would you do a show like me with me like this on a regular show like you, like me?

1183
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,800
Wait,大哥.

1184
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:30,800
Adding.

1185
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,800
I'm interviewing.

1186
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,800
Frigina.

1187
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,800
How long?

1188
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,800
What?

1189
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,800
David Gist, swears his housekeeper's name as legitimate.

1190
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:38,640
How are you getting?

1191
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,460
Virginia Casimba.

1192
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,300
I was funny.

1193
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,140
Yeah, I was funny.

1194
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,140
It was pretty good.

1195
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,140
How about this?

1196
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,140
How about if when I'm here, we do like three shows a week?

1197
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,140
Yeah.

1198
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,140
We could do that Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

1199
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,820
Well, you know, I promise that if I'm in the house,

1200
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:55,820
I'm not doing anything special, just call me.

1201
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,420
And is it Patricia?

1202
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,420
Yeah, but we have to do something.

1203
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:01,420
What we have to do, I mean, we'd have to do.

1204
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,420
I mean, I don't know.

1205
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,460
I mean, sometimes I think it's important that people have

1206
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,940
something every single day and sometimes I think maybe it's better

1207
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,240
if we did a little, like, today's show is definitely longer.

1208
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,280
We did a little longer show.

1209
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,280
It's a little longer show.

1210
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,600
But I promise I'll be in the show a little bit more.

1211
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,600
But that's very important.

1212
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,600
I can't believe people want to hear that.

1213
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,600
I mean, either.

1214
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,800
But, you know, it's like I'm stuck with this.

1215
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,800
So what am I going to do?

1216
