Is it Friday already?

8
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:06,800
Hey, I remember the beautiful, oh dear, that guy who flew with blood on the internet.

9
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Well, you make it up, and then you break it all up.

10
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,800
You let the pieces fall, and then you sweep it all up.

11
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Yeah, you pick yourself up, oh, say something to do, because you're inside out.

12
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:39,800
I'll just change this room, when inside your head, tonight.

Knees like crap

31
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,300
When you fall and run

32
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,020
Yeah, Lanky, that's what I meant.

33
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,420
Fallin' hard for the girl.

34
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,540
It's so hard.

35
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:47,660
From the Podsate Music Network and Hi everybody, it is Friday and isn't every Friday a good

36
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,660
Friday.

37
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,020
Well, this one is in particular.

38
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,460
Yeah, you know, there's like, some going on with that Lanky dude, I'm here and everywhere

39
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,700
seeing the top pod play and the Podsate Music Network, only one song up on the network.

40
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,060
So far, the one you just heard, he's from New Jersey.

41
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,460
Now, actually reading from the Podsate Music Network bio, New Jersey native and current

42
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:10,140
Houstonian, Lanky's smart pop melodies and introspective lyrics are delivered with a strong

43
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,740
instantly likable voice, agreed, a consummate road warrior, Lanky has developed a devoted

44
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:20,540
national following, selling over 3,000 copies of his debut album, mostly from his car trunk

45
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,140
and hopefully now through a couple of podcasts, all right, everybody, how you doing?

46
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,060
You can hear, I still have some of the, some of the bronchial crap going on.

47
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:37,780
Good show today, the thing I'm liking about it most is it's just us, just us in the podcasting

48
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:43,740
universe, no satellite window today, it's for two reasons.

49
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,140
First of all, this stuff I'm going to talk about today, I don't think the satellite

50
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:52,420
people will care about those of them in their car, listening to a serious, and secondly,

51
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,740
they don't work on good Friday over there.

52
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,100
So my choice was either create a new show that will run only, that will run on Friday

53
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:06,420
and create it on Thursday, and I can't do two shows on one day, or skip it, so I skipped

54
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,820
it, and I'm just recording this for us guys.

55
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,860
Let me see, a couple of things that happened yesterday after we last spoke.

56
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:20,060
First one is I got even more comments and more questions and more suggestions about

57
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:25,940
a possible pod show UK, I'm calling it draft and darts.

58
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,940
They know what draft is, don't they?

59
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,580
Here in the UK, I know they don't want any head on their beer, but I'm just calling

60
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:38,300
it draft and darts, and I signed up at the Britcasters forum at Britcasters.com, I believe

61
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,580
it is, where low and behold, a lot of the UK podcasters hanging out, and so there's all

62
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:49,860
kinds of suggestions and ideas and there's a wiki set up like, okay, so today, I think

63
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,820
10 AM Pacific Coast time, we're actually having a meeting, we're going to discuss our trip,

64
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:02,780
excuse me, I really don't do it on purpose, since so, we're going to discuss our trip,

65
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,980
got a meeting conference call, and we're going to start getting stuff set up, and we'll

66
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,980
have all the right people in the room, because of course I'm a horrible organizer, and

67
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,940
I'll never get any shit off the ground, so we're going to really do this professionally,

68
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,980
but the meet and greet won't be professional, it'll just be hangout, that's, in fact,

69
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,940
we're also going to see if there's other stuff going on that we just might go to and

70
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,900
show up there, we're just going to see what we can work out, but it is in the planning,

71
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:32,820
somewhere between the 20th of April and the 27th, so it was interesting, I talked to

72
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:38,700
Neil Dixon yesterday, who's a prominent Britcaster, it was a nice chat, and it was funny

73
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,620
because I knew he was interviewing me, but I wasn't quite sure, you know, we're halfway

74
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,740
through the Skype call, I'm thinking of myself, is he recording this, or is he going

75
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,140
to write it down later, or, and he was recording it, so I'm glad that I just said, well,

76
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,700
I'm just going to chat and talk, and we had a great conversation, and he had some interesting

77
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:02,220
questions, and we talked about the difference between US and UK culture, and some of the

78
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,260
animosity that flows back and forth between our peoples, so hopefully you'll have that

79
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,060
up pretty soon, so we can, so we can enjoy it.

80
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,180
It's Melinda!

81
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,180
Oh yeah!

82
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:20,260
And this is a show, a podcast devoted to Marilyn Monroe, subscribe and download it, just click

83
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,820
and play, and listen to my Marilyn today!

84
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:30,060
Hi everyone, my name is Melinda Miesin, and I'm the host of the My Marilyn Podcast, a podcast

85
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,220
dedicated to the life and times of Marilyn Monroe.

86
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:38,460
I'm celebrating my one-year anniversary doing the show with a very special episode.

87
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,700
The anniversary extravaganza is coming up with lots of fabulous prizes to give away.

88
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,500
I've also released my very first My Marilyn Music Video.

89
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,900
I took my favorite Marilyn inspired song that I've played the past year, and created

90
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,300
a very powerful video to go with it.

91
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:02,460
It is video iPod compatible, so I hope you guys will check this all out at www.mymarlin.ca,

92
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,340
or look for me in iTunes.

93
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,740
Thanks ever so for listening.

94
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:16,460
Is that the one and only Jeff Smith?

95
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,460
He's getting around, isn't he?

96
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:24,460
I checked out the video, Melinda, I loved it, it was great, very beautiful.

97
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:30,060
Congratulations on your celebrations, and I hope lots of people tune in and definitely

98
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,060
hoping lots of them subscribe.

99
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:37,020
Now, we talked about unleashing Podshow Plus and the podcast delivery network around

100
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,020
Tax Day.

101
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,820
I didn't actually realize that April 15 falls on a Saturday, and of course, when you look

102
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,700
at a timeline schedule, you just see an April 15th, and that's where you're going to start

103
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,460
unleashing, and that's our date, and so there's going to be some work going on over

104
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,460
the weekend.

105
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,340
Today, though, we have a noon, we have a special Fubar Friday.

106
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:59,460
We always have Fubar Friday's at Podshow, usually at the end of the day, we break out

107
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:07,140
the O essentials, like beer, wine, and cheese, stanky cheese, and chips, and stuff.

108
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,900
Some are better than others, sometimes people come and perform, sometimes we have someone

109
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,540
come over and talk, but today it's going to be a lunchtime meeting, and it's with the

110
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,420
entire company, and this is going to be some pretty cool stuff we're discussing, mainly

111
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:27,020
because we're starting to shift now from a development company to a product company, which

112
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,620
is very different from the way we've been working currently, and man, there's just

113
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:36,780
there are so many moving parts to, and we've created a list of products that just blows

114
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,700
me away when I look at it, or you look at the dashboard, which some people will call

115
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,660
a player, but you'll see there's a huge difference with what we're doing, and what

116
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:50,900
are thinking is on playing, and browsing, and discovering, and getting podcasts, audio, and

117
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:57,780
video of all formats, the podcast delivery network, that's the piece that I'm actually

118
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:05,460
so incredibly comfortable with, I've been using the PDN interface, which of course is all

119
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:11,860
behind lock doors right now, I've been using it for quite a while now, and yesterday

120
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,900
as you know, I used cast blaster for the first time in the full front to back configuration,

121
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:21,740
so one press of the button from cast blaster, show notes, tags, everything, all up to the

122
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:29,820
PDN, RSS feed is updated, show notes put in place, the file is uploaded, nice progress

123
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:38,820
bar, by the way, so we have a D-gap, our dynamically generated asset placement, we've fooled

124
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,700
around with that a little bit, of course, you're hearing the GoDaddy tags now in front

125
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:49,340
and the limelight tags in back of most of the pod show podcast delivery network hosted

126
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,980
podcasts, what kind of background would that be?

127
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,620
We've used it for the golden ticket, which was extremely successful, and I'm going to talk

128
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:06,340
a bit about the golden ticket some more, as we start to unleash pod show plus.

129
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:10,460
Now, so as I said, we have the podcast delivery network, and then pod show plus, and what

130
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:17,980
is this, it's a social media network, so I think everyone has an idea of what a social network

131
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:23,740
is, in fact, the pod save music network is a form of a social network, at least by my definition,

132
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,860
you know, the cool thing about the pod save music network is if you hear a song at a pod

133
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,780
cast, you can go to that show, show site, you can look at the show notes, click on the link,

134
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:35,420
it'll take you to the artist, so I'll do that with a lanky like I did right now, so I'm now

135
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:40,940
on the lanky page, you can, this is really how a social media network operates, now you can

136
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:47,180
listen to the song, so I just clicked on a listen button, but you can also see who else has played

137
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:53,980
this artist, and then you'll see Mikey pod on the bio, PMC top 10, lucky bitch radio, writing

138
00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:01,900
with the window down, so let me get PMC top 10 as an example, and there you'll see not only

139
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:08,220
falling hard for the girl by lanky, but you'll see what's this hair of the dog, which is a candy

140
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:15,420
butcher song, so the theory there being that if you don't really need a recommendation engine to

141
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:21,500
understand that if you like a song and their pod cast who played that song, you might like some

142
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:26,300
of the songs that those pod cast played, so that's how in our mind, the social media network

143
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,380
starts to come together, and of course there's all different kinds of entities, there's songs,

144
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,420
there's pod cast, there's promos, there's listeners, there's promoters, there's pod casters,

145
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:42,780
and all of this comes together in pod show plus, and of course you can't really unleash one

146
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:48,380
without the other because every listener can also be a podcaster and every podcaster is definitely

147
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:55,900
a listener, so within the course of today's Charlie I'll be explaining exactly how we're going to

148
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,500
start letting people experience pod show plus and how we're going to bring you the unleash.

149
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,900
Hello, this is Dan Cody of the reverse engineers. I have an important request, we're looking for

150
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:13,020
some short films or animation to be projected behind us in our live shows. The films can be of any

151
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,900
topic or theme, if any of you would like to receive exposure for your work, please email video clips

152
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:23,340
to the reverse engineers at gmail.com. We might also feature your films or animation,

153
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,500
feature music video, and we'll give you a promotion on our website. We're looking forward to seeing

154
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,780
some interesting submissions. If you like to hear our music or read our lyrics for inspiration, please visit

155
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:40,140
the reverse engineers.com. Yeah, so that's another thing that'll be apart. Not immediately,

156
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:49,900
not the next week or so, whoops, nice fade out, thanks. Is video, how do we manage assets like that? How

157
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,940
can you know for sure that if you're a member of the network, you can use pod save music and

158
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,580
sync that up with video and how can other people use that to create something new? I mean, that's

159
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:06,620
really where this, all the fun comes from, really. How do we make interaction better between

160
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:13,260
producer of a podcast and listeners and all of this stuff? Did you hear that? Literally, the

161
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:19,260
senseo is just coming out of my ears. Oh, this doesn't sound particularly pod save,

162
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,260
and maybe I should talk over it, so I don't get arrested. Hey, pod, father, it's miles from

163
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,740
the strip. We hope you had a great vacation while you've been gone, some crazy stuff's been happening

164
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,460
on the strip. First, Steve tracked down comedian Kathy Griffin at the world's largest buffet,

165
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,940
which ended up in the Guinness Book of World Records. She was actually a little snarky to Steve.

166
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,820
Why don't I do the jokes and you did the article? Then last week, Starship Charlie Palmer used

167
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,380
our program to announce he's building a $400 million hotel condo near the strip,

168
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,980
but he also answered juicier questions like this one. What's the

169
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:56,860
grisiest most unhealthy thing that you have? Your guilty food that grisiest.

170
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,540
And finally this week, we had the legend himself, Johnny Mathis, who's going to be playing in

171
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:08,060
your neck of the woods this year in London at Wembley. Next week, Louis Anderson,

172
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,140
check us out at the strippodcast.com.

173
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:17,740
Yo, strip, proud member of the podshow podcast network, and I got to say,

174
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,380
man, those guys really get some interesting guests on the show and it's so cool because people

175
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,260
are in Vegas, you know, they're thinking, I'm in Vegas, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas,

176
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,820
you know, some guy or two guys come up with a microphone and ask some questions and then, you know,

177
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:37,500
so that's when people celebrities become people and real emotions start to come through and they

178
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,420
start talking trash and talking shit and announcing stuff and there's some, you know, some

179
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:49,900
well-known names, so definitely check it out, the strippodcast. You can go to podshow.com to find out

180
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:55,900
more and I'll put a link into the show notes you can find it easily. Yesterday, Ron sent an email

181
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:01,500
to a podcaster who I'd not heard of before. I guess he's been listening to a podcast for a while now

182
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,020
and he said that he immediately wanted to nominate her for your day job status

183
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:14,700
within the network and I listened to it and it's, it's really good. It's called, she's called

184
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:23,020
Marpezia and you can find her at MarpeziaNow.com. She's the queen of the underground and she's a

185
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,980
hip-hop rap artist and she plays her own stuff but also talks about her life and it's really

186
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:35,980
interesting. Just listen to episode 25 which was released on the 13th of April and so immediately

187
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,860
this is how the brain works right. You get into, oh yeah I was looking for some more hip-hop songs

188
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:46,620
and hip-hop podcasts and just looking at the podshaking music network hip-hop is definitely

189
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:53,580
definitely coming in really strong and I found a song that I wanted to play for you. Hold on a second.

190
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,940
I just wanted to get the details on this because the production was so incredibly high.

191
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:07,100
Here it is. 360 is the name of the band. 360 a group of 13 young artists out of Richmond,

192
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,740
California. All music comes from the experience of these talented teens who have lived in unique

193
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,380
and sometimes rough environments. I think you'll like resume.

194
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,060
What's up position? I'll be your lady.

195
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:36,300
I'm a man, so I beg you. I can't stop being into the test and I'll never touch it at the end of you again.

196
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:04,140
I can see it in your pocket. I can see it in your pocket. I can see it in your pocket.

197
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,140
I can see it in your pocket. I can see it in your pocket. I can see it in your pocket.

I can see it in your pocket. I can see it in your pocket. I can see it in your pocket.

208
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,700
More talk about the first folks we're going to let in to Potsho Plus and the podcast

209
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,660
Lary Network in a couple of moments. Hello. Hey Adam. Hey. This is Maurice.

210
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:40,700
I'm Maurice from the Netherlands. I just wanted to share the following thing with you because

211
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:49,820
I was driving in my car this morning listening to your daily source code or Charlie

212
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:57,660
so to say 365 by the way, congratulations with your one year anniversary in that way.

213
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:07,180
I was just a relaxing listening to your podcast and drink some coffee which I made at home

214
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:18,460
Senteo of course and well I had the Senteo effect so I kind of burped and I kind of

215
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:26,060
overmodulated you because you burped at the same time and saying Senteo and it was oh my god

216
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:33,740
this is freaking well kind of was brilliant mind think alike my friend that's what you're trying to say

217
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:43,180
funny. Anyway just wanted to share that with you. I also like to to mention another thing

218
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:51,340
I was thinking about this advertising thing on podcast again. The thing is that when I listen to

219
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:59,740
podcasts which have advertisements like earthing or go daddy or whatever at the end of their shows

220
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:09,420
what my iTunes does is that it it makes us it with the next podcast auto mix. What's already

221
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:16,940
starting so I kind of miss the advertisement at the end. That's a really good point that just shows you how

222
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:23,900
asked backwards everything is you know iTunes of course was built from music and we're still stuck

223
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:29,580
with ID three tags which are predominantly meant from music there are new versions coming online but

224
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:35,900
I think and I know that the iTunes development team listens to the daily source code. I think the

225
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:41,180
logical thing to do there is because you can this is setting inside iTunes I think it's on by default

226
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:46,380
which cross fades tracks from one to the other you can set how many seconds in or at the end of the

227
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:55,100
track the fade will start and I think the the simple answer there is if the ID three tag for genre

228
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:00,700
is podcast it should be automatically not mix that's what makes sense to me or if you're listening to

229
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:05,100
him in your I think if you listen to in your podcast list though actually don't mix one to the next

230
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:10,140
but I could be wrong about that so obviously that's just a slight change it could be made into iTunes.

231
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,380
I tend to when I listen to my entry three player that once I know to show this

232
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:21,420
well finished I skip to the next one or search for another one I'd like to listen so I kind of missed

233
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:28,540
the the advertisement at the end so I was kind of thinking it would be better if you put your

234
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:34,060
advertisements you have right somewhere in the middle of your show. I love this here's a listener

235
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,820
asking for the advertisements to be in a spot where he can actually hear him I love it.

236
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:44,700
The listener doesn't expect it to come and then just well you want me to trick him.

237
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:53,500
Let him listen to the advertisement at that time. Well just just a little bottom on that.

238
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:00,380
Thanks a lot for the great work you're doing for this fantastic community shift of third

239
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:07,180
already do can wait for the pdm to come and definitely gonna be there. Also I'd like to

240
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:13,980
navigate a little plug for my own podcast of course which is the Sunday sundown and you can find

241
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:21,180
that on sunday sundown dot lockspot dot com. The best public music easy listening music you can get

242
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:26,220
on the budget music network. Thanks and keep on the good work man bye bye.

243
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:31,660
Yeah dude thank you. Sunday sundown dot com dot blockspot dot com. Check that out very nice

244
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:38,620
subscribe to it. In my pod show plus which is now where I manage all of my subscriptions.

245
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:44,620
Oh man this is gonna be so cool. I'll tell you what. Let's talk about the first the first

246
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:51,500
users we're gonna let in. First let me see if I can get this role. Yes. Oh I love it when

247
00:24:51,500 --> 00:25:09,900
a brand comes together. Sing along. Well I haven't done a Trinity segment in a while.

248
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:15,980
Let's see we got the first thing up is an email from Marty who uh and this of course goes back a

249
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:21,900
few weeks one and he was looking at the uh Victor Mike Charlie the video cast of me going to

250
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:28,060
the pod show offices from the condo drive and Trinity and uh he said as many other people that

251
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,380
it's Trinity leaking fluid. I saw spots on the concrete when you backed out of her stall.

252
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:40,380
I think someone else asked that earlier but you know it's just an old car. Shit just leaks out

253
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,460
once in a while. It's nothing you can do about it. I don't think it's drastic though. It's not like

254
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:51,260
as a whole whole puddle of stuff. It's just probably from well you know what? Shit's leaking your

255
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:55,740
rights. I don't know it's here. I've been enjoying the Delta long enough to feel like what

256
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:01,260
you've got in a first name basis. The trials, challenges and successes that you have shared

257
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:06,380
have been valuable lessons will create a rust tanker though. You're making an impact on a large

258
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:13,420
established industry by refusing to accept the way it has always been. Your Trinity segments about

259
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:19,580
violence will have been interesting. I had to tell you that the oil industry has not threatened

260
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:25,740
by an oasis with a couple of tanks to fill up hobby cars for a swage to guilt of rich people driving

261
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:31,980
brand new machines. It has however been worrying about the disruptive effects of nuclear power

262
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:39,020
for more than 50 years. You see, uranium is 2 million times as concentrated as a oil and caused

263
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:48,540
about one tenth as much for an equivalent amount of energy. At Atomic Insights www.AtomicInsights.com

264
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:54,620
I've been sharing knowledge people may not yet have about Atomic Energy for more than a decade.

265
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:01,340
I recently launched the Atomic Show when Shane Brown, the fellow Atomic Geek,

266
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:09,900
Check us out at Atomic.gov.cast network.com. I have never struck $16 million of the airplane

267
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:17,500
I've asked. I have, however, spent a few years fly around the ocean at minus a couple hundred feet

268
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:25,100
in a zero emission sub worth more than a billion bucks. Following seas at him, keep up the good work

269
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:37,260
on the delta. I was already having trouble hearing you. Wait a minute, you travel a few hundred

270
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:46,620
feet below the seas on an Atomic Insights. On a non-emission sub, that is cool. You definitely got

271
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:52,300
to do a sound seeing tour of that. What I love to be on a sub one day, that's I've always wanted

272
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:57,180
to fly. I got that part out of the way and I really love the whole concept of submarines, man.

273
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:08,300
I just cut the music since the levels are all off today. Another website, a lot of people

274
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:14,460
sent this link to me, senators Obama and Lugar. I guess there is introduced the alternative

275
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:19,340
fuel exact. If you hadn't heard about this Barack Obama and Richard Lugar, that's a Democrat

276
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:26,140
and a Republican introduced legislation designed to further promote the use of biofuels and alternative

277
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:33,900
fuel technologies to decrease the U.S. dependence on oil. The American fuels act of 2006, which is S.2446,

278
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:38,860
takes a multi-step approach that includes mandated levels of production and use of alternative fuels,

279
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:43,420
synthetic as well as biofuels, consumer tax credits, manufacturing tax credits, public access

280
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:48,140
to alternative fueling infrastructures and the creation of a new office, the director of energy

281
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:54,220
security. So there's clearly a lot going on and hopefully even there's some little pieces of

282
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:59,500
the Charlie the country. Hi Adam, Kelly Walker here from Bloomington, Indiana. Several weeks ago,

283
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:04,460
I sent you an audio comment regarding some bio diesel buses from Murray State University

284
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:10,140
that I spotted on the Indiana University campus. You had a question. I wonder if it's 100%

285
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:16,460
bio diesel or is it mixed here because you can mix this vegetable oil based bio diesel with any amount

286
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:23,500
of petroleum based diesel that you want and any measure it all works just perfectly fine.

287
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,820
I didn't have an answer to your question but I didn't figure it would be hard to track down

288
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:35,500
somebody who did. My name is Dickie Turner and I am the assistant director of transportation

289
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:40,300
for Murray State University here in Murray, Kentucky. Mr. Turner was kind enough to give me a few

290
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,940
minutes of his time to answer your question Adam. So how about it, Mr. Turner? What is the

291
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:50,460
blend in the Murray State buses? We use a B-20 blend out in all of our equipment here at the

292
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:57,740
University. Willie Nelson's bio diesel I believe is I think is B-80 so it's still it's only 20%

293
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:03,340
veggie oil and 80% petrochemical. I believe it could be the other way around. No, you have it exactly

294
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:11,580
right Adam. The B-20 is strictly about diesel product, our particular how diesel product we use

295
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:21,420
a soybean blend 20% of the fuel is the bio diesel product like said make from a soybean derivative

296
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:26,860
and then 80% is regular diesel fuel that's why it's called a B-20 blend.

297
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:33,180
How long has Murray State been using bio diesel? Murray State started using the bio diesel product

298
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:41,660
in 2001. So we have had those buses in the fleet for quite some time. In addition to the buses

299
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:50,620
we have trucks, tractors, heavy lawn mowers, construction equipment like griders and backhows.

300
00:30:51,740 --> 00:31:00,940
We have roughly 38 emergency generators for buildings here on campus. All told we have roughly

301
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:09,740
little over 100 pieces of equipment that use our bio diesel product. So why bio diesel at Murray State

302
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:17,500
University? Murray State is located in western part of Kentucky. Typically we're a farming and

303
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:26,540
latin industrial area and anything that we can do to help improve our air quality, support our

304
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:36,860
economic development by building a stronger demand for U.S. soybeans and reducing our dependence on

305
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:42,140
foreign oil is what we're looking at. Do you think moving to bio diesel has been a good thing

306
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:47,660
from Murray State University? One thing that you'll notice about vehicles that use bio diesel.

307
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:57,900
You saw one of our buses, our school system here in Kalawak County schools. They're just

308
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:04,860
switching over to running bio diesel in their school best fleet. When you start a typically,

309
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:10,700
when you start a diesel engine you'll get a puff of black smoke. Well, when a vehicle is running

310
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:18,780
bio product, you don't get that same black smoke. It's more of a gray and the outer is different

311
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:25,900
in all the details with regular diesel fuel. So we're looking at children out there loading up on buses.

312
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:33,820
We're looking at equipment working in close proximity to building here on campus and we're trying

313
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:38,620
to be the better environment for everyone. So there you have it, Adam. I hope that answers your

314
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:43,660
question and gives you a few more interesting facts about biodiesel in the Midwest. My podcast

315
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:48,220
in partner Jerry Bain has come up with a lot more biodiesel activity right here in Bloomington,

316
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:53,180
Indiana. And we plan to have some updates for you on that real soon. Thanks for everything, Adam.

317
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:58,140
No, thank you. And I really appreciate what you did because wasn't that cool to hear

318
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:06,620
a true patriotic American? I mean, truly a patriot going out there, changing the way things are

319
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:13,260
working and why to increase production of American soybeans and to reduce dependence on foreign oil.

320
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:18,220
I love it. This is fantastic. And this is without a doubt the way of the future.

321
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:24,700
And San Francisco is jumping on board, title of this article. Here's the scoop. San Francisco

322
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:30,140
to turn dog poop into biofuel. In a pilot program to start this year, Norcal waste,

323
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,940
garbage company that collects the city's trash plants, used biodegradable bags and dog

324
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:39,820
waste carts to pick up the poop in one of San Francisco's most popular dog parks. The

325
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:44,460
waste will be run through a methane digester, a tank in which bacteria break down the feces to

326
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,340
create methane. This biofuel can then be piped directly to a gas stove heater or anything else

327
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:54,620
powered by natural gas. And then there's a Norcal spokesperson who has a great quote,

328
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:59,980
scraping dog poop off your show off your shoe off your show at a lot of dog poop on this show.

329
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:06,140
Scraping dog poop off your shoe, now that's something that most people have been frustrated with

330
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:11,020
for a long time. Now we have an opportunity to turn this nuisance into something positive.

331
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:18,860
Yes, indeed. Can we contribute? Can Chris Rockwell contribute?

332
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:26,620
You know, today is, I believe it is today, National Poop Day. So check out the daily download

333
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:31,820
or the poop report for more information on that and I thought that was just a completely

334
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:40,060
fitting piece of news to pass on this historic day. The charity theme that levels were all

335
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:44,620
off so it couldn't actually hear people. That's why I stopped it. But there is another Jeff Smith

336
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:50,940
extravagant that I'll play for in case you never saw the video. It's just a nice,

337
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:56,940
another hummer. I mean, a song can come along too. It's Trinity's very own theme song.

338
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:38,380
We went out to know it's a brand new day stop now. Come on in, Queen, my machine, Queen, my machine,

339
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:51,740
Queen, my machine, Queen, my machine. Still working on finalizing the sponsor for Trinity.

340
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:57,580
Remember, we want to pimp her out. Come on, big sign on the back and says,

341
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,260
save the world. We've been viable prizes.

342
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,420
Now quite honestly, there's not so many companies. They're in a bio diesel bio fuel.

343
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,340
I think we'll be able to get a sponsor. Maybe a sponsor that can contribute some actual content

344
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:25,900
to the second. So we can learn more about saving the world and winning valuable prizes. Jeff Smith,

345
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:36,540
green, my machine on the daily source code. Hello, Mr. Curry. This is Mad Sumo. I want to thank you

346
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:42,540
for spinning my tune. So many ways I can kill you on your recent edition of the Delta Sierra

347
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:50,300
Charlie since premiering on the first episode of accident hatch. The very first, so many ways I can

348
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:56,860
kill you has gone on to become the most popular rap song in the history of the positive music

349
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:06,300
network. And I am overjoyed that the tune has found its way onto your playlists and into your heart.

350
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:15,260
And I say cheers, mate. Mad Sumo.com. Cheerio. Dude, I like it. It was cool. Awesome song.

351
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:19,980
Is it really the most popular rap song in the podcast music network? That I didn't know.

352
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:25,900
I guess we could tell by a number of plays. That's not another piece of function. I mean,

353
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:30,380
we've got so many things that we want to do. Now, let me just go back to the Unleash of Potio

354
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:37,420
plus and the Potio. The Potio Potcast delivery network. The better known as the PDN. So there's

355
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:42,220
so many moving parts. So much stuff that we want to, so many features. I mean, we have the

356
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:49,260
a feature party every single week and we talk about what we can come up with and what we can

357
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:55,980
put in. And there's so many smart brains that are a part of this process. That it's, you know,

358
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:01,100
of course, we'd never be done. There's a moment in time when you're done with development.

359
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:06,140
And I've really haven't done a lot of software development. I've been a part of companies

360
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:11,900
that have developed software of tried some things unsuccessfully as well, making wrong choices

361
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:22,700
such as the Java too early in the game. But this has been such a fantastic experience.

362
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:29,740
I'm so excited at how we're going to roll this out. Now, you have to start somewhere. And as I said

363
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:36,700
previously, we're, you know, we're a audience-focused company. So we're really building things

364
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,940
for listeners and for viewers now that pod casting. Since we've been developing pod casting

365
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:45,660
gone from not just audio, but really to audio and video. I mean, they're both on par with each other.

366
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:50,300
I feel. And there's a lot of experimentation and a lot of cool things going on in the audio field

367
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:56,540
in the video field as well as audio. We're coming out with pod show LA stuff. We've got the drama

368
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:03,260
on the way, which is Shadow Falls. We've got our game show bone coming up. It's a more viral video

369
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:08,700
project. It's just a lot of stuff. Podcasts are coming into the network. And part of the promise

370
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:15,660
was, is anyone should be able to use the podcast delivery network. And that opportunity is coming

371
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:20,140
as well as a part of the unleash. But as we're thinking about who do we want to get in first?

372
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:27,660
Remember, we're an audience-facing company. So we really want listeners. And as I went back

373
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:34,300
through the past year and a half, actually longer, almost two years now, how the development of

374
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:40,060
iPodder went to, you know, moved over into, oh gosh, how many pod catchers didn't we have besides

375
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:51,980
iPodder itself? iPoderex, nimic, net newswire, does it? Gosh, there's just so many

376
00:39:53,180 --> 00:40:01,900
blog matrix, too many to even come up with. But the first listeners, that is very clear to me.

377
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:08,220
The first listeners were developers. Now, as a part of pod show plus, we've got a lot of

378
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:16,380
customizable stuff. Stuff that can be customized by someone who is just a listener. And we actually

379
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:23,500
hear that. They're coming to get me already. We also have an SDK, a software development development,

380
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:32,620
or developers kit. And we're setting up a CVS, which is a revision system. So you can check

381
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:39,900
code in. And the first listeners we want to invite in, who will be able to obviously access

382
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:46,060
everything that is now available on pod show plus and everything that comes out as development

383
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:52,060
continues, as well as being able to use the podcast delivery network will be developers.

384
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:58,620
Because, and I really, the developer I worked the most closest with was Andrew Grummit. And,

385
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:03,500
you know, developers, yeah, they're guys who create software and gals who create software.

386
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:13,660
But by definition, they're creative writers. And all of them are listeners. They are. I mean,

387
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:21,020
you can't create a podcast receiving or podcast experience in joint application without actually

388
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,900
enjoying it. Otherwise, you're working for someone else and you're building something to

389
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:31,900
spec. You know, the love that went into iPodder and all these other, now known as juice, of course,

390
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:37,820
and all these other applications, that only came from a place where developers were listeners.

391
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:43,660
So we're going to let them in first and we're going to give them the SDK so they can start

392
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:51,180
building the better experience. And by the way, we'll pay them for it. If your code is selected,

393
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:57,980
we'll definitely pay you. So there's cash prizes. Yes, valuable prizes. And you're going to be the

394
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:04,060
first ones in starting next week. So we're coming up with a couple different ways to get people in.

395
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:11,580
But if you're developer and you're interested, get ready and definitely check out Monday's daily

396
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,500
source code for your chance to get in early on pod showblus.

397
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,940
Welcome to Game Snack for the situation normal. All followed up. I'm your host Nick.

398
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:43,180
Hey Adam, that was an intro from my weekly podcast game snafu. I'm about to reach my 20th

399
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:48,300
episode and it's a 13-year-old podcaster. I have a big audience and I'm having a blast.

400
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:53,660
So I want to say thanks and ask you to include the section for younger podcasters in the pod show

401
00:42:53,660 --> 00:43:00,220
lineup. As you know, it's teen two buys and most iPods and video games. So here's my plug.

402
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:08,460
It's game snafu on iTunes or at two cool dudes.com. That's T-O-O cool dudes.com. Thanks.

403
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:13,180
So we haven't actually discussed this at the company yet. But the next group right after the developers

404
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:19,340
or staggered of course that I'd love to bring into the network, not just podcasting, but as

405
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:24,780
listeners really to try and come up with new cool things to do with our social media network

406
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:32,460
we've been building. Would be teens or tweens or whatever. I want to get Christina in. I'm really

407
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:38,460
afraid. I haven't given Christina access yet because I'm so afraid that you know, she'll take

408
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:43,740
one look at it and something will be missing until never want to go back to it again. So I'd say by

409
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:47,420
the end of next week, I'm going to hit her access as well and have her start messing around with

410
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:53,900
stuff and start playing with some of the modules that the developers come up with. And hopefully

411
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:58,940
have her and invite some of her friends in and before you know it, before you know it,

412
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,900
the train will be rolling. It will. It really will.

413
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:37,900
If I just put my phone on, see if he's out of the food. She accidentally shot herself and she

414
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:52,620
started eating a food. Let's go. Let's go. Well, it's a grand corner, but I don't think I'm making it there.

415
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:59,340
Because it's almost right at it. I don't think.

416
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:30,860
She's got a back switch place. Tammy's got a can of me. They're going to the supermarket.

417
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:38,540
It's pretty full in the face. I'll let you know.

418
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:50,460
Well, it's around the corner, but I don't think I'm making it there. Because it's almost right at it.

419
00:45:52,620 --> 00:46:09,580
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The hot rods. Yeah. Almost Friday night.

420
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:15,100
Figured you like that one as a wind up into the Easter weekend. They're from California originally

421
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:19,900
out of the fabled Coachella Valley LA based hot rods through their thing at diverse bars and

422
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:24,380
honky tongs. They work outside the system, streamlining the operation boiling it down to the

423
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:29,740
good stuff. Look out for the hot rods coming to your town soon. And I'll be back Monday.

424
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:34,940
Even though it's a holiday, I'm going to kick it because we're going to start with our

425
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:40,220

you don't have to be a hardcore developer. If you know anything about,

427
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:49,420

00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:53,900
Stuff that even I could do. I think with a little bit of concentration and focus,

00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:12,700

00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:21,340
