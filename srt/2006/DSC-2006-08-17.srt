55
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:02,100
I don't want you to see, I don't want you to see

56
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:08,100
So let me

57
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:16,100
Rusted smile, poison yes

58
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:22,100
Hit the fever in the face

59
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:27,100
Lift the light, love to hate

60
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,100
I can't go play

61
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,100
I can't go play

62
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:48,100
Why don't you see, I don't want you to see

63
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:54,100
It's only me, I can't

64
00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:00,100
Why don't you see, I don't want you to see

65
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,100
It's only me

66
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:39,100
Rusted smile, poison yes

67
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:48,100
Rusted smile, poison yes

68
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:54,100
Hit the fever in the face

69
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,100
Lift the light, love to hate

70
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,100
I can't go play

71
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:10,100
I can't go play

72
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:18,100
I don't want you to see

73
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:27,100
When you hold that day

74
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:32,100
I don't want you to see

75
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,100
From New York City, Blake Morgan

76
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,100
Why don't you see from the pod save music network

77
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,100
I told Patricia, hi baby

78
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,100
Listen to who's singing along and tell me if you can guess who it is

79
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,100
Brian Adams

80
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,100
Oh no

81
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,100
We wish

82
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,100
Michael Butler

83
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,100
Almost as good as Michael Butler

84
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,100
Lenny Kravitz

85
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,100
That's why

86
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,100
That's why

87
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,100
Brian Adams doesn't sound like the Beatles

88
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,100
No, but the voice

89
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,100
You hear him in the background

90
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,100
He's on the chorus

91
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,100
He might play guitar

92
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,100
I love those drum fills

93
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,100
That was so functional

94
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,100
Yeah, very functional

95
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,100
It's not too much

96
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,100
Not too much

97
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,100
This is a good moment to do a little drum fill

98
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,100
Not less than too much, you know

99
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,100
Very good

100
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,100
Baby, how are you doing?

101
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,100
Yeah, doing fine

102
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,100
Last time when we spoke

103
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,100
I mean, you're not fulfilling your contract at all on the show

104
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,100
But last time we spoke

105
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,100
I'm not feeling my contract

106
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,100
No, you can't appear

107
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,100
I didn't sign anything

108
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,100
Oh no

109
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,100
No, not yet

110
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,100
No

111
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,100
I make you sign so much stuff

112
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,100
Just sign here, baby

113
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,100
Don't even think about it

114
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,100
It's important, just sign

115
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,100
Just sign

116
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,100
Just sign

117
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,100
You don't need your glasses right now

118
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,100
First of all, we know everything's in your name

119
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,100
Actually

120
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,100
Tonight we're having cocktails

121
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,100
And dinner

122
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,100
With our banker

123
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,100
And two over colleagues in London

124
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,100
So I'm going to be the guy sitting with four babes

125
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,100
Yeah, which is nice.

126
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,100
Rainy, babe.

127
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,100
Yeah, but she actually she called me and she said two things.

128
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,100
She said, is it okay if I wear blue jeans?

129
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,100
Because I really, I'm so happy if I'm not wearing the banker suit.

130
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,100
Oh, she wants to look sexy.

131
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,100
Yes.

132
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,100
For you.

133
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,100
And she said, and I have some paperwork.

134
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,100
So, do you mind if, you know, you just tell me when it's okay to pull out the paperwork?

135
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,100
Yeah.

136
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,100
I don't worry about it.

137
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,100
So, no, but last time we spoke, we had, you know,

138
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:50,100
a terrorist threat and your sister was here.

139
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,100
Yeah.

140
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:56,100
So, took a long, long time to get to Rotterdam, right?

141
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,100
She left, yes.

142
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,100
Oh, Amsterdam actually, and then Rotterdam.

143
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,100
Yeah.

144
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,100
Let's see.

145
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,100
She left the house at 3 o'clock.

146
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,100
What time was she home?

147
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,100
10, 30, 11 o'clock?

148
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,100
Yeah, just about 10, 30.

149
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,100
She's like eight hours to get home.

150
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,100
I could have flown her back and forth twice.

151
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,100
I know.

152
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,100
And stopped off for fishing chips.

153
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,100
Yeah.

154
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
And gotten you some flowers from the gas station.

155
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,100
I could have done all of that.

156
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,100
My sister is a little bit afraid of these sort of things.

157
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,100
Flying and, you know.

158
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,100
It only hurts her, sir.

159
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,100
I always had to protect her for everything.

160
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,100
Well, this is why she's such a pussy, because she always protected her.

161
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,100
I know.

162
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,100
No one had to do it.

163
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,100
Did anyone ever push her and say, go do it?

164
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,100
Well, they were afraid to do that.

165
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,100
Would mean they would?

166
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,100
No.

167
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,100
No, but yeah.

168
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,100
I mean, didn't want like you push her.

169
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,100
Well, we tried.

170
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,100
I don't know what she's afraid of.

171
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,100
To die.

172
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,100
Death.

173
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,100
Yeah.

174
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,100
I got to tell you the older I get, the less afraid I am of death.

175
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,100
I really.

176
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
Is that so?

177
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,100
Yeah.

178
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,100
Yeah.

179
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
And quite honest.

180
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
I always think, you know, I came so far.

181
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,100
What should I do this?

182
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,100
Nothing happened until now.

183
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,100
You know?

184
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,100
Oh, but I look at it exactly the other way.

185
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,100
I said, look at all the things have done so far.

186
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,100
Yeah.

187
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,100
So if I do this one more thing and something happens.

188
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,100
It doesn't matter.

189
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,100
Oh, I think I have to.

190
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Look at you.

191
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
You're so young.

192
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Let me tell you.

193
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Oh, oh.

194
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,100
I just got an email.

195
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,100
This is horrible news.

196
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,100
It's about death.

197
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
Sophia.

198
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,100
Oh, Sophia best away.

199
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Yeah.

200
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,100
It's Ron and Marta's little Yorkie.

201
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,100
Oh.

202
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,100
She was in hospital for about a, what?

203
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,100
More than a week.

204
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,100
We can have almost two weeks.

205
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,100
So no, no, operation.

206
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,100
I think I didn't get the details.

207
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,100
Ron just sent an email.

208
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,100
I think she, I think she had the operation.

209
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,100
She had a collapsed trachea.

210
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,100
Something like that.

211
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,100
And these dogs are so small.

212
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,100
So that's what I wanted to explain.

213
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,100
It's a, it's a York's Yorkshire Terrier.

214
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:57,100
And if it's really a small size dog or animal or little cats doesn't matter, baby cats.

215
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,100
I always hear the same thing.

216
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,100
If there's something wrong that gets sick, it's hard to help.

217
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
Of course it is.

218
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,100
It's so tiny.

219
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,100
It's so small.

220
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,100
You know.

221
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,100
Yeah.

222
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
And they have a breeding thing.

223
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,100
It's, it's very hard.

224
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,100
Yeah.

225
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,100
Well, then, and when they get nervous, then it gets desperate.

226
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,100
Yes.

227
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,100
Exhaust rates.

228
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,100
Exhaust, it makes things harder.

229
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Yes.

230
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
Yeah.

231
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,100
Oh.

232
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,100
We're seeing a year ago.

233
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,100
Ron's dad passed away.

234
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,100
Yeah.

235
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,100
Jesse passed away.

236
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
My mom passed away.

237
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,100
So fee passed away.

238
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,100
Yeah.

239
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
Other people around us.

240
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,100
How many people have we not seen pass away in the past two years?

241
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,100
Maybe 10.

242
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,100
Do you think people who we know?

243
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,100
I mean, not necessarily friends, but yesterday, could I not know?

244
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Yeah.

245
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,100
Another area.

246
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,100
Well, it's radio.

247
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,100
It's radio.

248
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,100
It's radio legend.

249
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,100
Let's not know why.

250
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,100
Yeah.

251
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
Wasn't the on the pirate ships as well?

252
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,100
Wasn't he certainly as well?

253
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,100
But I know they just back to that.

254
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,100
I did the last radio program with him.

255
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,100
Really?

256
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Yeah.

257
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,100
He's last radio program or the last one.

258
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
The last radio program.

259
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,100
You know, doing music, talking about music and something with the stars.

260
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,100
It was the last time the stars.

261
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,100
I actually performed in his radio show.

262
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,100
Right.

263
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
And that was the last time we said goodbye.

264
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,100
So, you know, I just like, I hate that.

265
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,100
It's like all these people dying.

266
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
Yeah.

267
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,100
That's what my mom and dad say.

268
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,100
Well, they're 80.

269
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,100
So, yeah.

270
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Yeah.

271
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,100
They're burying all their friends.

272
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,100
All their friends.

273
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,100
It scares the hell out of my mom.

274
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,100
And that's why your mom was like, fuck.

275
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
And I'm getting an Adam's plane.

276
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,100
Oh, we're calling him donuts.

277
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,100
Yeah.

278
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,100
Oh, yeah.

279
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,100
She's bending.

280
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,100
She's going out every day.

281
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,100
Yeah.

282
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,100
She takes my dad and said, come on.

283
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,100
Let's go out.

284
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,100
You know, really?

285
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,100
We think about that.

286
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,100
That is really so cool.

287
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,100
If you can spend all your money right up until your death.

288
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,100
And then just go.

289
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,100
Yeah.

290
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,100
Well, that's what I say.

291
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Your kids don't worry.

292
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Don't worry about your money.

293
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,100
Just spend it.

294
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Exactly.

295
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,100
I mean, don't need it.

296
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,100
We don't want it.

297
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,100
I don't think your kids need it anyway.

298
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,100
No.

299
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,100
It's yours.

300
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,100
They should spend it.

301
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,100
You went for it.

302
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,100
I mean, I'm definitely not thinking like, oh, you know, I want to make sure my daughter said,

303
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,100
I want to make sure my daughter knows what to do in life.

304
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,100
It can take care of herself and doesn't have to rely on there.

305
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:18,100
Well, I think the only kids get their money right away from the parents go actually wrong

306
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,100
first.

307
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Possibly.

308
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,100
Possibly.

309
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,100
You have to work.

310
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
You have to appreciate it.

311
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,100
You have to do something for it.

312
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,100
You're much happier.

313
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,100
You do something.

314
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,100
And you work.

315
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Yeah.

316
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
All those kids in Hollywood.

317
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,100
You hear it from the start.

318
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,100
They give a money here.

319
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Go.

320
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,100
I mean, you can't come.

321
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,100
I mean, let's just take the star equation out of it.

322
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,100
I mean, that kid to grow up with show business parents is different.

323
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,100
That's different.

324
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,100
It's different altogether.

325
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,100
And quite honestly, most kid to grow up with show business parents have no money.

326
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,100
Because most people show business don't really actually have money.

327
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,100
It's they have the fame which you think they have money, but it's not really rich.

328
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,100
Let's say rich then.

329
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,100
Not the famous.

330
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,100
It's just rich people.

331
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,100
Rich people.

332
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,100
Yeah.

333
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
It's not good.

334
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,100
You have to teach your children to teach your children well.

335
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,100
To actually work for it.

336
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,100
I think it's so much happier.

337
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,100
Let's move off of death for a second.

338
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
Interesting.

339
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,100
I just had my yogurt with so many tricks and branches.

340
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,100
I put so many seats in it.

341
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,100
I probably have a flower garden in my stomach by now.

342
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,100
You know, there's so many things that I could have said just now.

343
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,100
A flower garden.

344
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,100
No, you would seeds in your yogurt.

345
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,100
There's so many seeds in there.

346
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,100
Because they say so good for you, but I think.

347
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,100
Well, don't eat that shit, man.

348
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,100
That's what horses eat that stuff, you eat.

349
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,100
That's not real food.

350
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,100
That's good for me.

351
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,100
I hope.

352
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,100
Listen to this.

353
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,100
Hey Adam.

354
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,100
This is Lindsay Curve from the Great Board of City of Carlisle.

355
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,100
Carlisle, by the way, is located about nine miles from Scotland.

356
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,100
We are inish.

357
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,100
All I want to do people with disagree.

358
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,100
Hey, the youth.

359
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,100
But yeah, I gave you a telephone comment.

360
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,100
A couple of weeks ago about the fact that I was going to be a daddy.

361
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:06,100
And the very fact that we conceived our first child to the sound of you and Patricia.

362
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,100
Now, when you heard that comment, you wanted to know some more details.

363
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,100
Yeah.

364
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,100
Well, I'm not going to go into full details, but put it this way.

365
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:22,100
It was playing in the background as the lights were low.

366
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,100
The candle flickered.

367
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:30,100
And we made sweet love to the sound of the daily source coming.

368
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:35,100
So in honor of that fantastic moment, and when the child is born,

369
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,100
it will be forever known as D.S.C.

370
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,100
Sure, three hundred and seventy.

371
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,100
I thank you.

372
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,100
Oh, by the way.

373
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,100
Yes.

374
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
Fold it.

375
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:54,100
I thought he was going to say, if it's a boy, we'll call an Adam.

376
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,100
Yeah.

377
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,100
If it's a girl, we'll call him Patricia.

378
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,100
But no, we'll call him D.S.C.

379
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,100
It's one of the most popular names Patricia I heard.

380
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,100
Yes, they still.

381
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,100
That's funny.

382
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:09,100
I saw somewhere there was a chart, and you could, and you can look at names.

383
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,100
And it was basically, for the last, I think, last hundred years.

384
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,100
You could look at the popularity of the names.

385
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,100
And Patricia actually was still there.

386
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:23,100
But you can see the peak was around 40, between 40 and 45.

387
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,100
Oh, yeah.

388
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,100
Yeah.

389
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,100
And Adam was around 1970.

390
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,100
You know, I was born in 64.

391
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
And before Christ.

392
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,100
And before Christ.

393
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,100
Yeah.

394
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,100
Yeah.

395
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,100
It was very popular back before Christ.

396
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,100
Yeah.

397
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
It was the, it was the name.

398
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,100
It was still a beautiful name.

399
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,100
Beautiful.

400
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,100
I hated so much when I grew up.

401
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,100
You still hate him?

402
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,100
No, no, I like it very much.

403
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,100
No.

404
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,100
Yeah.

405
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,100
No, it's very sexy.

406
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,100
Adam.

407
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,100
Adam.

408
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,100
Here it is.

409
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,100
Adam.

410
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,100
It's very beautiful.

411
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,100
Adam.

412
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,100
The English state.

413
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,100
Adam.

414
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,100
Adam.

415
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,100
Adam.

416
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,100
Adam.

417
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,100
Oh, please, Adam, eat it.

418
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Adam.

419
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,100
What?

420
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,100
What did you say?

421
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,100
No, I'm not confusing.

422
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,100
My goodness.

423
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,100
It just came out.

424
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,100
It's goodness.

425
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,100
Congratulations to.

426
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,100
I was thinking about.

427
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,100
I'm tired.

428
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,100
I'm not going to say it.

429
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,100
Oh, is there no?

430
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Immigian.

431
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,100
Oh.

432
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,100
That's why I heard a lot of you living in the UK who have watched Big Brother,

433
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,100
which is ending tomorrow night and of course we're big fans of the show.

434
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
And we've watched it pretty much really justly.

435
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,100
It's all was hated it.

436
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,100
But this time.

437
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,100
Yeah.

438
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,100
Imagine who was this beautiful Welsh girls.

439
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,100
She was a former Miss Wales.

440
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,100
gorgeous.

441
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,100
She was voted out last week.

442
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,100
And so nice.

443
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,100
Very proper.

444
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,100
Very proper.

445
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:49,900
So I received an email yesterday with a link to a sex tape that had image in on it.

446
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:55,900
And it's like a parasitalton like sex tape and it's really her and she's really getting it.

447
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,900
Yeah.

448
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,300
And you recognize her way of talking.

449
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,300
She even says, oh, baby.

450
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,300
Oh, baby.

451
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,300
No, baby.

452
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,300
No, baby.

453
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,300
Oh, baby.

454
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,300
Oh, baby.

455
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,300
Oh, baby.

456
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,300
Oh, Adam.

457
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,300
Oh, baby.

458
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,300
Yes, he does.

459
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,900
So I'll definitely put a link to that in the show notes.

460
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,300
You've, I mean, I think we're the first ones who know it.

461
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,300
I mean, wouldn't the English papers be all over that if they knew that?

462
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,300
I don't know if it's maybe in the paper this morning because that's possible.

463
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,900
Yeah, I haven't gotten a paper yet.

464
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,700
I don't think so.

465
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,100
I think this is this is still pretty underground.

466
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,700
But this is when this gets out.

467
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,300
I mean, yeah.

468
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,700
And it's, it just goes to show.

469
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:39,100
Well, actually, it doesn't do anything because look at Pamela and this and look at

470
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,100
I will never look at Pamela Anderson the same way.

471
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,100
Yeah, or Tommy Lee for that, man.

472
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

473
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,100
She looks so sweet.

474
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,100
I want to make it.

475
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,100
I once watched that whole tape.

476
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,100
It was, it's an hour long.

477
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,100
That video.

478
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,100
Yeah, Pam and Tommy.

479
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,100
And it's really boring because it's them on.

480
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,100
It's basically a vacation.

481
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,100
Why are you watching it whole hour?

482
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,100
It was on a hotel, uh, spank division.

483
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Wanker vision.

484
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,100
Wanker.

485
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,100
And I'm like, oh, watch that.

486
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,100
He, hun, Tommy Lee, the fucking horse.

487
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,100
Like the guy in images video.

488
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,100
Excuse me.

489
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,100
Did you see that thing?

490
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
No, everybody will go and watch.

491
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,100
Just give me your professional opinion.

492
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,100
Uh-huh.

493
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,100
It looked nice.

494
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,100
Yeah.

495
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,100
No, it looks huge.

496
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,100
Yeah.

497
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,100
Yeah, it was big.

498
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,100
Yeah.

499
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,100
I don't know if everybody likes that.

500
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,100
Like what?

501
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,100
Too big.

502
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,100
No.

503
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,100
No, no, no.

504
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,100
I can't speak for that.

505
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,100
Just a regular nice, normal one.

506
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,100
Nice, nice knob.

507
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,100
Nice, nice, nice knob.

508
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,100
We'll do generic knobs.

509
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
We'll do.

510
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
We'll do.

511
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,100
Okay.

512
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,100
Congratulations to Don and Drew.

513
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,100
Second year in in a row.

514
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,100
They won the best, uh, they won the podcast award.

515
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,100
Uh-huh.

516
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,100
For was it comedy, I think?

517
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
No, uh, mature.

518
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,100
mature.

519
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,100
Not comedy with you.

520
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,100
Not mature.

521
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,100
Yeah.

522
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,100
mature comedy.

523
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,100
Uh-huh.

524
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,100
Well, they're not all about comedy.

525
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,100
They mature.

526
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,100
But so they want for the second year in a row.

527
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,100
Lovely.

528
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,100
And C.C. Chapman with accident hash for best podcast music show.

529
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,100
So, uh, very happy about that.

530
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,100
Yeah.

531
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
I didn't even get nominated, huh?

532
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,100
No?

533
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,100
No.

534
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,100
Absolutely not.

535
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,100
But um, I mean, that's a surprise.

536
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,100
Are you in the competition?

537
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,100
No, I tell you.

538
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,100
I mean, I mean, I'm the anti-Christ people like me.

539
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,100
No, you're not in the competition, I think.

540
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,100
No, I mean, I'm not.

541
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,100
I did not get nominated, so I couldn't win.

542
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,100
No.

543
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100
No.

544
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
No.

545
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,100
No.

546
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,100
That's why I'm not listening.

547
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:41,100
You always blame me not listening.

00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,100
What, now, what are you saying?

549
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,100
What are you saying?

550
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,100
You're saying you don't listen because it sucks,

551
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,100
or because I'm not nominated.

552
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,100
What are you saying?

553
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,100

No.

558
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,100
Okay.

559
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,100
It's not because the don't want to listen because I have no time.

560
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,100
But, uh-huh.

561
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,100

That's okay.

565
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,100
It's okay.

566
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,100
But what does that have to do with the not being nominated?

567
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,100
It's teasing you.

568
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,100

00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,100
Don't do those things.

571
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,100
Do not like that.

572
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,100
Well, you can be very serious though.

573
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,100
Oh, yeah.

574
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,100

Um, oh, this is funny.

576
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,100
You know that video show I did, the, um,

The one that, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

579
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,100
Now, what did you think of that?

580
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Just honest opinion.

581
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,100
I, I loved it.

582
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
Yeah.

583
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,100
Yeah.

584
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,100
And the podcast or news website.

585
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,100
Mm-hmm.

586
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,100

testing out video.

588
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,100
But it's amazing.

589
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,100
How crappy it looks for all the millions of dollars they received in, uh,

590
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,100
in venture capital financing.

591
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,100
Oh.

592
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,100
The fuck is that?

593
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,100
It's supposed to be like we're doing stuff ourselves and doing it.

594
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,100
Yeah.

595
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,100
The way we want to do it.

596
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,100
How simple it is.

597
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,100
Hell, is that all?

598
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,100
The podcast or news website?

599
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,100

608

Yeah, but they found that forever. That's that's their family property. Oh, she's against the royal family

646
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,940
Really. Oh, you don't I don't think you find many of those

00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:17,440
What did she want it what does she like then? Well now she just hated you know the thoughts that the thought that they are so filthy rich

650
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,440
They have such a beautiful beautiful

651
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,440
Jewel recollection gold silver

652
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,440
I mean furniture have no idea is and she said they have it stacked away even more

653
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,440
Yeah, but more isn't isn't that up to them who cares for these are also present because if you read it

654
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:40,440
It says a present from this queen and a present from that. Yeah, sure. I don't understand I don't understand

655
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,440

00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:49,440
Yeah, yeah, I mean you've got a car as well. It's all paid for it. Got it from everywhere

657
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,440
But I don't understand that at all. I don't understand who cares. It's not like they're any happier because of all the shit

658
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,440
They've had a lot of problem in that family. I mean and they got thousands of thousands of people

659
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,440
People walking through you their garden. Exactly. Thank you exactly. They need the money

660
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:13,440
They need the entrance fees. Yeah, they do. It's a good point. It's a lot of money. It's not cheap. What is it cost?

661
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:22,440
That's for $2,000 50 pounds, $50,000 50 pounds, $50,000 per person, $2,000 to be old. No, I can't be happy

662
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:29,440
I think $25 per person, but it depends on what you want to see if you go further and you look for garden

663
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,440
Look at the rest of the house. For 50 pounds, I want to build a tug on Charles's ears

664
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,440
Because there was also you know only the dresses or you go on and go. Really?

665
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:45,440
It's all a cart menu. Yeah, very strict everywhere security cost a lot of money. The whole thing

666
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:52,440
And also to buff it up to keep it nice keep it clean. Yeah, I think you know there's some taxpayer money that goes to that

667
00:28:52,440 --> 00:29:00,440
And some of the stuff that you see is from 1600s and very dusty and I love that. I love that dusty stuff

668
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,440
No, not the dust stuff. You know that it's so old you can just can't believe it

669
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:12,440
Yeah, so that was interesting. Okay. I always do these things with my sister and sometimes with you

670
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,440
But I like that. I like to see I like to go to museums and you sort of things

671
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,440
I have to see so much more actually from England

672
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,440
Well, this is what my plan was is for us to go fly around a little bit and see some things

673
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,440
But the weather well, I really haven't had the time in the weather. She don't have the time

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,440
And I can't get you out of my mind

697
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,440
Not a day goes by

698
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,440
We don't think of you

699
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,440
Without you, I'm blue

700
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,440
I miss you

701
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,440
Not a day goes by

702
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,440
When you don't feel my heart

703
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,440
We've been too long apart

704
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,440
I miss you

705
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,440
I wake up in the morning

706
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,440
You're singing in my head

707
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,440
I'm thinking about you

708
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,440
When I'm lying in my bed

709
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,440
I can't wait to see you

710
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,440
And it's just a matter of time

711
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,440
I got a smile running through me

712
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,440
And I can't get you out of my mind

713
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,440
Got a smile running through me

714
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,440
And I can't wait to see you

715
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,440
I'm thinking about you

716
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,440
Without you I'm blue

717
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,440
I miss you

718
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,440
And I can't wait to see you

719
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,440
I'm thinking about you

720
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,440
When you don't feel my heart

721
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,440
We've been too long apart

722
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
I miss you

723
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,440
I'm doing it to do it to do it to do it

724
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:19,440
I'm doing it to do it to do it

725
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,440
Now to take a spin

726
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,440
Now to take a spin

727
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:34,440
Now to take a spin

728
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,440
I can't stop thinking about you

729
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,440
Now to take a spin

730
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,440
Now to take a spin

731
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,440
Now to take a spin

732
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,440
Now to take a spin

733
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,440
Now to take a spin

734
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,440
Now to take a spin

735
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,440
That's so sweet

736
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,440
He's very, very hip

737
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,440
I was thinking

738
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,440
While I was listening about waking up with a smile on my face

739
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,440
This morning I woke up with a smile

740
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,440
And I looked at you

741
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,440
And you looked worried

742
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,440
You weren't awake yet

743
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,440
I saw a sort of a worried look

744
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,440
Well I got lots to worry about

745
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,440
That's what men do

746
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,440
I got lots to worry about

747
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,440
You can wake up with a smile anyway

748
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
It's not worry

749
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
It's responsibility

750
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,440
But all kinds of stuff we've got to do and things we have to take care of

751
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,440
You have so much on your list

752
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,440
And we have like 65 people in our company

753
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,440
I feel responsible for them too

754
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,440
That's just a lot of stuff

755
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,440
But I'm happy

756
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,440
Yeah, I'm very happy

757
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,440
Just not when you wake up

758
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
I wasn't awake, I was asleep

759
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,440
That's not fair

760
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,440
We were awake and then you were still a little bit in waking up

761
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,440
Let's replay the event

762
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,440
Shall we?

763
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,440
You woke up with a smile on your face

764
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
And because you wake up

765
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,440
Because I look at you and I think it's so wonderful to wake up next to you

766
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
Thank you

767
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,440
So I of course subconsciously know that

768
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,440
That you're awake so I start to wake up

769
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,440
And what is the first thing you said to me?

770
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,440
It's a beautiful day

771
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,440
I know that would not be the first thing you said

772
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,440
Do you remember the first thing you said?

773
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,440
I was sitting on

774
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,440
On the bed

775
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,440
Three play the movie in your mind

776
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,440
Oh, I've been up since eight o'clock trying to wake up

777
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,440
Because I was thinking

778
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
About the car

779
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,440
We have to take the garbage out

780
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,440
Was the way I heard it?

781
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,440
No, not like that

782
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
No, I was asleep

783
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,440
I don't like that

784
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,440
I was asleep, but that's so when I'm kind of waking up

785
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,440
It's like, yeah, I have to get up to the garbage

786
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
But you know, why?

787
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,440
It was a whole time before that

788
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,440
And I was just waking up looking at you

789
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,440
Thinking of the stuff and then I thought

790
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,440
What day is it today?

791
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,440
It's garbage today

792
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,440
You really should not go walking outside in your nighty like that

793
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,440
Because if it's not some Dutch asshole

794
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Photographer who's going to take a picture of you

795
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,440
It's going to be Roger Smalls who's going to jump out of the bush

796
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,440
Go and help Patricia

797
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,440
I always look at them

798
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
I always hope the neighbors out

799
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,440
Because he has such lovely legs

800
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Mr. James

801
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,440
Really?

802
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,440
Yes, gorgeous legs

803
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,440
More gorgeous than mine

804
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
Yes

805
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,440
So I say, good morning neighbor

806
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,440
Love your legs

807
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,440
Love

808
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,440
You know what? English people

809
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,440
Don't get that

810
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,440
You know, don't get that

811
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,440
You don't quite get that humor

812
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,440
You got gorgeous legs

813
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,440
And he looks at me

814
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,440
Doesn't know what to do with it

815
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,440
You know what we were talking about

816
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,440
We had no video evidence yet of the so-called terrorist

817
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,440
Who were

818
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,440
You know, that caused this entire scare

819
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,440
And I said, well, you know

820
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,440
I basically said, well, you know, maybe it's an illusion

821
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
Kind of like the fact that we never landed on the moon

822
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,440
Yeah, yeah

823
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,440
I still believe we didn't landed on the moon

824
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,440
I don't think he said that

825
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,440
I'm sure we could not

826
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,440
Don't start anything, please

827
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,440
But listen to this

828
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,440
I don't know, just as it's for 40

829
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,440
When you're off on a bit as a tangent to when you mentioned to it

830
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,440
You say that you don't believe that we ever walked on a moon

831
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,440
Now what I find interesting is

832
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,440
NASA has recently lost the original footage of that event

833
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,440
Okay, has it lost a bit of film

834
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,440
One was called it over coronation stream

835
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,440
Tell how about that

836
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
Is that true?

837
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,440
Well, I don't know, I mean, I'm going to presume it's true

838
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,440
I haven't actually found any new stories about it

839
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
But how interesting is that NASA can be

840
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,440
Well, that is a nice view

841
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,440
I'm lost the footage

842
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,440
I have even tapes of me in 1976

843
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,440
Well, they didn't have zoom lenses

844
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,440
They had the switch of the lens

845
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,440
I'm turning around

846
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,440
1966 and 67

847
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,440
And I don't have anything from that

848
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,440
Well, I mean, of course, but they're talking about the original footage

849
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
You don't have the original footage

850
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,440
It doesn't matter to me, it's fine if we didn't walk on the moon

851
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,440
Well, there are more people saying that

852
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,440
I'm only 400,000 miles away

853
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,440
From my own seat on Richard Branson's spaceship one

854
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,440
Oh, get out of here

855
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,440
Shut all

856
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,440
I think we only need like 18 more months of traveling back and forth

857
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,440
Between here in San Francisco and I can fly on the spaceship

858
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,440
Really?

859
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,440
Wow, I'll go obviously

860
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,440
How cool would that be?

861
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
I don't want to do that

862
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,440
But I want to sit on his shoulders

863
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,440
That's the only thing he can carry me

864
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,440
I like him

865
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,440
Richard Branson

866
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,440
So it's Richard Branson, it's Jimmy, I look worried

867
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
Maybe you should be shopping around, maybe

868
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,440
Looking for some other guy

869
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,440
You know, I love you

870
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,440
You know that, that's why I can say these things

871
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,440
This is true

872
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
Nothing will happen

873
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,440
Only one at a time

874
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,440
At a bed

875
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,440
Oh, man

876
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
I will never look at image in the same way

877
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
Do you enjoy imaging?

878
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,440
Looking at that, looking at

879
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,440
Pamela Anderson in your hotel room, do you hear me about that?

880
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
No

881
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,440
But that's completely different

882
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,440
It's different

883
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,440
Of course

884
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,440
I have no problem

885
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,440
She means it

886
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,440
Can't trust any bitches

887
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,440
You guys think else babe, we should wrap up

888
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,440
No

889
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,440
I am a softie

890
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,440
I just heard that

891
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
To softie

892
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,440
Well, the way I treat my daughter Christina

893
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,440
Oh, you want to bring that up?

894
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,440
No, well, don't bring it up, but I didn't say anything

895
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,440
No, no, no, no

896
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,440
I'm a softie, I know

897
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,440
I just, because I always hear that teenagers

898
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,440
You don't listen to me, you don't treat me like, you know, an adult

899
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
You treat me like a child

900
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,440
And I try to treat her like somebody who's intelligent

901
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,440
That's right, you know, it's exactly what I heard

902
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
I was standing up here, I'm listening to the conversation

903
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,440
You're bickering and yelling, I'm like, wow, that just sounds just like the way you talk to me

904
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,440
Like adults talk

905
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,440
It does not work, she's 15

906
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,440
She thinks she's going to be 16

907
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,440
Because if she, if I talk to her with the don't, I want you to be hated

908
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,440
No, I'm going to, I said yes, I want you to be home

909
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,440
First, you would you didn't hear that?

910
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,440
That was the start

911
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,440
I just said, I want you to be at home

912
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,440
You know, like we spoke, we talked about that yesterday

913
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
You know, you know, no, no, no

914
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,440
Because I have to be at the physical therapist at that

915
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
So I'm going to be in the city, I'm going to be staying at that

916
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,440
No, I said no, and then I start to be frustrated

917
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,440
Because she's not listening

918
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,440
Maybe you didn't give her a reason

919
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,440
You should've said, I want you to be home because mom and dad are going to see

920
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,440
I said that, I said that

921
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,440
So then what, you know, then it goes wrong and then all I hear is like

922
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,440
Christina!

923
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,440
And I have to say, look, would you like a sweet 16 party?

924
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,440
You don't have to raise your voice at all

925
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Yeah, I know, and you know what?

926
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,440
I don't think about these things, I don't think about bribing

927
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,440
Yeah, but it's not bribing, it's not

928
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,440
It's fucking fair, she wants us to do all this shit for her

929
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,440
She has to do something for us, it's called give and take

930
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,440
It's called living together

931
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,440
In a community

932
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,440
You can learn that in life, if you are nice and if you are giving and if you just listen to people

933
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,440
And you can get so much more out of it

934
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,440
Listen to me for a second now

935
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,440
If you drove down Epsom Road

936
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,440
And where you're allowed to go 30 miles an hour and you're driving 46

937
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,440
Which you did twice

938
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,440
And all that happened was the police would call up and say, oh Patricia, please

939
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,440
Please don't do that

940
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,440
Will you actually really think of it all the time?

941
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,440
Bullshit

942
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,440
Unless you see that big yellow thing, which by the way is interesting, you have never seen it

943
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,440
Yeah, now you do, that big yellow speed camera

944
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,440
It's just the way it works, there has to be people go away from pain and move towards pleasure

945
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,440
And so when you teaching is not just learning on one side, you have to do it both ways

946
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,440
I mean, you just know that it's like that

947
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,440
Okay, unfortunately, unfortunately it's because I've worked with

948
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,440
That's my daughter

949
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,440
Go ahead pick it up, I'll finish my thought

950
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,440
Unfortunately, it's because I've worked with

951
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,440
You know hundreds and hundreds, almost thousands of people in companies

952
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,440
Hello

953
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,440
Listen to this

954
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,440
Hi, excuse me

955
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,440
Oh boy, this is not our daughter

956
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,440
Who's this?

957
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,440
Who?

958
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,440
Eddie

959
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,440
Eddie

960
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,440
Bye

961
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
Who's Eddie

962
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,440
Oh, Ellie

963
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,440
No, I don't know an Eddie, that's all who's Ellie

964
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,440
Ellie is Christina

965
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,440
Yeah, it's a friend, because I'm looking for somebody

966
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,440
Oh, yes, I remember, okay

967
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,440
So anyway, so what I was saying is the reason why is because I found out

968
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,440
Through working with more than a thousand people

969
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,440
Yeah, you use a lot of people working with you

970
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,440
But it's give and take and it's real simply, look if you don't do this, this will happen

971
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,440
And you don't have to get angry, it's just, and if you don't like it, then you will freeze

972
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,440
Who'd you say it covers it?

973
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,440
And if you don't do that, you're fired

974
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,440
I've never said that, never, take that back

975
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,440
I've never, ever, take it back

976
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,440
What?

977
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,440
That's in a television program

978
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,440
I've never said that, anyone in my life ever

979
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,440
No, that's true

980
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,440
I've never threatened with firing up

981
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,440
Never, not, don't even make jokes about that

982
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,440
Oh, it's not true

983
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,440
I fired people

984
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,440
I've never threatened with it, it's unnecessary

985
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,440
If it's that far, if the only consequences you'll get fired, then it's like

986
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,440
Doesn't work that way

987
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,440
Yeah, so that's all, it's the way

988
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,440
But if you don't do your job, you know that

989
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,440
That's different, huh?

990
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,440
So I don't have to tell anybody that

991
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,440
No, that's a tell anybody, if you don't do your job, then dot dot dot

992
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,440
What happened?

993
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,440
But with a 15 year old who was still exploring life, remember how stupid we were at 15

994
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,440
I mean, when you were 15, I was, I had to lie a lot

995
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,440
I was still in my dad's telescope

996
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,440
Yeah, I know

997
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,440
I had to lie a lot, and I regret it so much

998
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,440
And I had to because otherwise

999
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,440
You wouldn't go anywhere

1000
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,440
This is what all 15 year olds think

1001
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,440
Regardless of whether it's true or not all 15 year olds think

1002
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,440
So that's why I don't want her to

1003
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,440
Anyway

1004
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,440
So because of those types of situations

1005
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,440
Where you are trying to treat Christina as an adult, which is

1006
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,440
I think really at this point in those situations in impossible tasks

1007
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,440
Because she just doesn't have the skills yet

1008
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,440
I don't think you can develop

1009
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,440
At 15, you just not develop

1010
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,440
But because of that, I think you have less patients with me

1011
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,440
Maybe

1012
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,440
Yeah, that's why I'm so happy to fix it with Christina

1013
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,440
She thinks so, absolutely

1014
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,440
I haven't got any patients for you

1015
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,440
Less, less

1016
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,440
It's okay, it's normal, but then I can understand

1017
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,440
Because it's like your daughter is acting like a shit

1018
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,440
And then I can be a little shit lit

1019
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,440
Oh, yeah, you know, I have to

1020
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,440
What?

1021
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,440
Two, two people

1022
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,440
Two young people

1023
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,440
Two youngsters

1024
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,440
All right, we're wasting people's time at this point

1025
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,440
No, they recognize it

1026
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,440
Yeah, I think they do

1027
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,440
People have been calling in, telling them about themselves

1028
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,440
Just calling into the voice mail number, which I should give

1029
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,440
Let me give you the voice mail number to call in

1030
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,440
Plus 1, 2, 0, 1, 6, 2, 5, 6, 3, 5, 7

1031
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,440
Or in London, 0, 2, 0, 7, 6, 8, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3

1032
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,440
And it's fascinating to listen to people

1033
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,440
The people that listen to this show are average age

1034
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,440
About 33

1035
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,440
Yeah, it's mature, I'd have to say

1036
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,440
There's a lot of 19 year olds who are listening

1037
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,440
But there's also a lot of people who are

1038
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,440
45, 50, some 60

1039
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,440
I'm really very, very happy with that

1040
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,440
Because I believe if you look at the advertising market

1041
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,440
Well, you're the over 40 and I'm the over 50

1042
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,440
Right, but if you look at the advertising market

1043
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,440
What is advertising always aimed at?

1044
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,440
17 to 24

1045
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,440
The shoppers exactly, 17 to 24

1046
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,440
But these people who are 35 and up

1047
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,440
They've got money, dude, they've got three or money to spend

1048
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,440
And they buy things and they're

1049
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,440
And particularly

1050
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,440
For some reason source code listeners, man

1051
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,440
They've got really high jobs in government and

1052
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,440
Nuclear power plants, you know, it's just amazing

1053
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,440
Yeah, so I'm going to do a montage one of these days

1054
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,440
And put them all one after another

1055
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,440
And so far, I'd say about 60% are folders

1056
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,440
Versus scrunchers

1057
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,440
You hadn't heard that?

1058
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,440
No, you're kidding me

1059
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,440
Dude, you got to hear the extended version

1060
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,440
I had to play them for you

1061
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,440
Oh man, you should listen to this show, it's pretty good

1062
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,440
Yeah, let me play, I'll play the whole thing for you

1063
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,440
You'll totally

1064
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,440
Hold on

1065
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,440
I'll see if I can find it

1066
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,440
I think it's this one full, I'm just trying to

1067
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,440
You remember Slow who did

1068
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,440
If you ever do a Christmas?

1069
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1070
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,440
So here it is, check it out

1071
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,440
For the role of toilet

1072
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,440
I'm sorry

1073
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,440
To the role of toilet people

1074
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,440
That's a different one, I have so many people who've sent in folders scrunchers

1075
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,440
Oh, the thing is, everybody does it

1076
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,440
Everybody gets, as to go

1077
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,440
You know, who's everybody recognizes it

1078
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,440
But I stopped so long ago

1079
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,440
With the, you know, really talking about folders

1080
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,440
Yeah, and they're still talking about

1081
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,440
We'll not stop

1082
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,440
It is, actually.

1083
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,440
Yes.

1084
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,440
Oh, my can't find this now, home on the second.

1085
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,440
Oh, here it is.

1086
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,440
The folder.

1087
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,440
Oh, man.

1088
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,440
This is so good.

1089
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:53,440
Check it out.

1090
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,440
Oh, I was doing it wrong.

1091
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,440
Well, don't you worry baby, don't worry.

1092
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:07,440
There's such a way, been wiping, wiping, wiping my bum.

1093
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:14,440
Because I'm a fuller, I'm a scruncher, I'm a roller, and I'm a buncher.

1094
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,440
I do my business on the throne.

1095
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:26,440
I'm a sitter, I'm a standard, I'm a left-right hender.

1096
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:36,440
It's nice to know I'm not alone.

1097
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,440
How cool is that?

1098
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,440
Fantastic.

1099
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,440
It's not pot safe, of course.

1100
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,440
It's so cool.

1101
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,440
Even up without their air.

1102
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,440
No, of course not.

1103
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,440
Nope.

1104
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,440
Nope.

1105
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,440
But I'll take that risk.

1106
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,440
Come and arrest me for that, please.

1107
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,440
What a great headline.

1108
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,440
Adam Curry jailed for folding her scruncher.

1109
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,440
Even the queen, I wonder.

1110
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,440
Even, oh, she's a folder scruncher.

1111
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,440
Scruncher, totally.

1112
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,440
Can you see that face?

1113
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,440
She doesn't care.

1114
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,440
And look, look at Charles.

1115
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,440
Come on, scruncher.

1116
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,440
Yeah.

1117
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,440
You know he's a scruncher.

1118
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,440
Yeah.

1119
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,440
All right, baby.

1120
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,440
I've got to go wash my hair, so you can do it.

1121
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,440
Yeah.

1122
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,440
And then we're out of here.

1123
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,440
We're going to Big Smoke.

1124
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,440
Yeah.

1125
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,440
Big Smoke.

1126
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,440
Big London City.

1127
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,440
Yeah.

1128
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,440
On the train.

1129
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,440
Yes.

1130
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,440
Can you still ask me?

1131
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,440
We're taking the train.

1132
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,440
Are you crazy?

1133
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,440
I'm thinking about high shoes.

1134
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,440
What kind of shoes do I wear?

1135
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,440
Because if I have to run for the train.

1136
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,440
No, we don't have to run for the train.

1137
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,440
If you can get out of the house.

1138
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,440
If you get out of the house on time, we don't have to run for the train.

1139
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,440
It's just carry me.

1140
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,440
Okay.

1141
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,440
All right, baby.

1142
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,440
Thank you very much for joining in.

1143
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,440
Would you please join us again soon?

1144
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,440
Thank you very much.

1145
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,440
Well, I was entertaining my sister.

1146
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,440
I mean, I was a long time that I saw.

1147
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,440
Seeing her.

1148
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,440
Seeing her.

1149
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,440
Seeing her.

1150
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,440
Seeing her.

1151
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,440
Seeing her.

1152
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,440
Seeing her.

1153
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,440
Seeing her.

1154
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,440
And so wanted to entertain her a little bit.

1155
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,440
Yeah.

1156
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,440
She had fun.

1157
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,440
She had fun.

1158
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,440
Yeah.

1159
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,440
Fantastic.

1160
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,440
All righty.

1161
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,440
So tomorrow we'll have the Friday festivities.

1162
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,440
Thanks.

1163
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,440
Thank God.

1164
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,440
It's Friday.

1165
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,440
Send in Europe.

1166
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,440
I'd say music picks for me to play.

1167
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,440
Which of course I ask people to do because I'm too lazy.

1168
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,440
And it helps.

1169
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,440
And so I'll see you maybe Monday or Tuesday.

1170
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,440
Maybe.

1171
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,440
Okay.

1172
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,440
I'll be there.

1173
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,440
All right, baby.

1174
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,440
Thanks for coming on the show.

1175
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,440
And tomorrow I'll try and wake up with a happy face.

1176
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,440
Okay.

1177
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,440
Adam.

1178
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,440
Thank you.

1179
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,440
I love you, baby.

1180
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,440
Yeah, babe.

1181
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,440
I love you, too, babe.

1182
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,440
All right, bye.

00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,440
