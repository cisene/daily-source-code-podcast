Deltess Yara Charlie, 43-4.

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:40,660
Sometimes an atom's on a loan and he needs his love right there on the microphone.

11
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:46,700
So here she is, yes, the Lady Patricia.

12
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:53,460
The say to handsome, bad, I've been one and with his angel from above.

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,900

17
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,980
It's atom and Patricia.

18
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,260
Yes, atom and Patricia.

19
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:44,220
I talk to my baby on the telephone all this time.

20
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:51,220
I never would have guessed back when there's someone so bad.

21
00:01:51,220 --> 00:02:01,900
Yeah, I really only met about a week ago, but he doesn't seem to matter to my heart.

22
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:13,900
I know that I love her, I'm hoping that I'll never recover, because she's good for me.

23
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:20,900
It would make me happy to never let us live away.

24
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:28,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

25
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,900
The like to give you the teenage crush, always cool day.

26
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:42,900
All the school day, I feel like the leader won't be on you again.

27
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,900
Yeah, I'm a little bit dizzy, I'm a little bit scared.

28
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,900
I guess I never met this much away that I love her.

29
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:03,900
I'm hoping that I'll never recover, because she's good for me.

30
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:10,900
I really only make me happy to never let us live away.

31
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

32
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:26,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

33
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:33,900
I really only met about a week ago, but she doesn't seem to matter to my heart.

34
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:45,900
I know that I love her, I'm hoping that I'll never recover, because she's good for me.

35
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:54,900
I really really make me happy to never let us live away.

36
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:23,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:30,900
And Rugold never let us slip away.

38
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,900
Uh...

39
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,900
For you baby.

40
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,900
Yeah.

41
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,900
Now...

42
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,900
One of my favorite songs.

43
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
I know. What do we know about this song?

44
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,900
What do we know about this song?

45
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,900
What do we know about this song?

46
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,900
One thing it's not.

47
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,900
Well, we're never gonna slip away.

48
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,900
But it's not a pod safe.

49
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,900
No, it's not. It's right.

50
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,900
But guess how come I can play it?

51
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,900
I don't know.

52
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,900
I got permission from Andrew Gold himself.

53
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,900
You're kidding.

54
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,900
Yep.

55
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,900
You bet you.

56
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,900
Really?

57
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,900
Yep. So I could play it for my baby.

58
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,900
I know.

59
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,900
So how did you do it?

60
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,900
Um...

61
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,900
Mark Yoshimone and M.Coff.

62
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,900
From my pod show L.A.

63
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,900
Yeah.

64
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,900
Uh... he knows him.

65
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,900
And he played...

66
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,900
Uh... what do you play?

67
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,900
He played another song.

68
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,900
And uh...

69
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,900
And I complained about it.

70
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,900
So what the fuck is that?

71
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,900
Yeah.

72
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,900
And uh... and turns out he's...

73
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,900
Uh... he's good friends with him.

74
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,900
So I said, could you please have him...

75
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,900
Recut this song...

76
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,900
To start with...

77
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,900
I talked to Patricia...

78
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,900
Oh, the...

79
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,900
Oh no!

80
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,900
He wouldn't do that.

81
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,900
He didn't want to do that.

82
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,900
Oh.

83
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,900
I understand.

84
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,900
I understand.

85
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,900
You don't want to mess with you.

86
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,900
That would have been a wonderful gift.

87
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,900
Yeah, that would have been even better.

88
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,900
That's what I figured out.

89
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,900
Better than a bunch of roses or anything.

90
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,900
Oh.

91
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,900
Shall I throw those out then?

92
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,900
Ha ha ha.

93
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,900
Hello, baby.

94
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,900
Hello, hi.

95
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,900
It's the Daily Source Code coming to you from Curie Cottage.

96
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,900
I'm back just arrived this morning.

97
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,900
Uh...

98
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,900
A couple hours ago?

99
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,900
Yeah.

100
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,900
On my favorite airline?

101
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,900
It's the Virgin Atlantic.

102
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,900
Yeah, I slept for...

103
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,900
I think five hours at least.

104
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,900
Yeah.

105
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,900
I really, really slept.

106
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,900
One thing I failed to understand.

107
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,900
If you're flying at 39, 40,000 feet.

108
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,900
Yeah.

109
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,900
And, you know, it's going to be a sleeper flight.

110
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,900
Yeah.

111
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,900
Right.

112
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,900
Why do they serve broccoli?

113
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,900
Ah!

114
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,900
This is so dumb.

115
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,900
Ah.

116
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,900
This is like such a no-no.

117
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,900
You do not serve people broccoli, particularly not when they're flying.

118
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,900
Like beans, broccoli.

119
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,900
You smell like ass.

120
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,900
The whole time is over.

121
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,900
Yeah, right now.

122
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,900
And...

123
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,900
It comes out of your ass.

124
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,900
Yeah.

125
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,900
So not only that.

126
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,900
Really?

127
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,900
But people have gone a pass.

128
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,900
Wind.

129
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,900
That's my whole point.

130
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,900
Yeah.

131
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,900
Well, that was kind of the point.

132
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,900
Is that though?

133
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,900
Yeah.

134
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,900
It just stinks because people just stink.

135
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,900
Yeah.

136
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,900
But they never think about it.

137
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,900
Because sometimes you have beans.

138
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,900
Lots of beans.

139
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,900
Beans is okay.

140
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,900
Broccoli?

141
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,900
This is okay.

142
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,900
Same problem.

143
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,900
Broccoli farts are worse than being farts.

144
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,900
I'm telling you.

145
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,900
God, he's home.

146
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:02,900
I finally have someone to talk to about all that nasty shit.

147
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,900
Yeah.

148
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,900
I missed you, baby.

149
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,900
I missed you too.

150
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,900
Yeah.

151
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,900
I missed our daughter.

152
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,900
Who immediately came to me with three questions.

153
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,900
One.

154
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,900
My cell phone was broken.

155
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,900
The light stays on too.

156
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,900
The laptop hasn't been working for two weeks.

157
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,900
And what was the third one?

158
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,900
Oh, um.

159
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,900
What?

160
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,900
Should I talk to a birthday?

161
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,900
No.

162
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,900
No.

163
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,900
There was something else.

164
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,900
Oh, yeah.

165
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,900
About her.

166
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,900
The money.

167
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,900
Yeah.

168
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,900
Something about money.

169
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,900
Oh, yeah.

170
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,900
What do I get my money?

171
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,900
Yeah.

172
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,900
When do I get paid for my downloads?

173
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,900
Welcome home, Dad.

174
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,900
How you doing?

175
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,900
Yeah.

176
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,900
That's exactly what happened.

177
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,900
Yeah.

178
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,900
Was to have your home.

179
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,900
So that was long.

180
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,900
Yeah.

181
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,900
Three weeks.

182
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,900
I think I was going for three weeks.

183
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,900
Was now or two and a half.

184
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,900
Almost three weeks.

185
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,900
Yeah.

186
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,900
Three weeks.

187
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,900
That's a bit too long.

188
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,900
That's a bit too long.

189
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,900
That's a bit too long.

190
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,900
That's a bit too long.

191
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,900
That's too long.

192
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,900
I mean, nothing to compare, you know, to people who are.

193
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,900
Who have gone sea on the sea or.

194
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,900
Right.

195
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,900
They're gone.

196
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,900
Well, they're gone probably for three weeks at a time.

197
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,900
Sailors.

198
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,900
Sailor.

199
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,900
I'm like your sailor.

200
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,900
Yeah.

201
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,900
I'm your sailor boy.

202
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,900
I've come home.

203
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,900
Yeah.

204
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,900
Yeah.

205
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,900
And I spent all that extra time.

206
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,900
I didn't spend with you.

207
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,900
I spent with the nerds and geeks.

208
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,900
Yeah.

209
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,900
Yeah.

210
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,900
The engineers.

211
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,900
It was cool.

212
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,900
It was good.

213
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,900
Yeah.

214
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,900
It was very good.

215
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,900
Yeah, I was definitely good.

216
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,900
Well, you were very busy.

217
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,900
Oh, man.

218
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,900
Here with it.

219
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,900
But that's kind of what's great about it is.

220
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,900
You know, all I do is get up at six in the morning.

221
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,900
Do the show.

222
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,900
Go to the office.

223
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,900
Come home around eight.

224
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,900
Eat.

225
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,900
Sleep.

226
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,900
No.

227
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,900
Wank.

228
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,900
Eat.

229
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,900
Wank.

230
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,900
Wank.

231
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,900
Wankers.

232
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,900
Wankers.

233
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,900
Exactly.

234
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,900
You had food in the house?

235
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,900
Yeah, man.

236
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,900
Yeah.

237
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,900
No, I'm set up.

238
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,900
No, I know how to do it.

239
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,900
Yeah.

240
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,900
No, I know how to be a bachelor.

241
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,900
20 years too late.

242
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,900
Yeah.

243
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,900
Yeah.

244
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,900
I'm not totally set up.

245
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,900
Yeah.

246
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,900
Yeah.

247
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,900
Well.

248
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,900
You know that women love bachelor's when they come in their bachelor pad.

249
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,900
And it's clean.

250
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,900
And they say that they have everything on the control.

251
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,900
Yeah.

252
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,900
Yeah.

253
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,900
Yeah.

254
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,900
Yeah.

255
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,900
Yeah.

256
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,900
Yeah.

257
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
I should try that test.

258
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,900
It's so good.

259
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,900
I should bring some buries up.

260
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,900
What?

261
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,900
I had the other way around.

262
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,900
I looked at your bachelor pad.

263
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,900
Yeah.

264
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,900
It was a stinking mass.

265
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,900
Hold on a second.

266
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,900
First of all.

267
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,900
Help.

268
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,900
I'll never forget.

269
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,900
Patricia takes one look at my bed and goes, don't think I'm laying in that.

270
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,900
And I said, don't think you were invited.

271
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,900
Yes.

272
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,900
See, that's good.

273
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,900
Good one.

274
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,900
Yeah.

275
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,900
When I was still back in the day when I was fresh.

276
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,900
Yeah.

277
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,900
And I had snappy answers.

278
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,900
Yeah.

279
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,900
But we can always lay on the floor.

280
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,900
Did I say that?

281
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,900
I didn't say that.

282
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,900
You said that.

283
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,900
Yeah.

284
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,900
Exactly.

285
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,900
So I haven't updated everybody on the house.

286
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,900
Oh, yeah.

287
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:03,900
So yesterday, after I'd already done the show Patricia, I got a frantic

288
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,900
SMS from Patricia that we didn't get the house.

289
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,900
Yeah.

290
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,900
Didn't get it.

291
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,900
I thought that the whole system with the envelopes was a bad idea anyway from the beginning.

292
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,900
Maybe you should explain what happened because the guy called up a day early.

293
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,900
He was supposed to call today.

294
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,900
Yeah.

295
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,900
They called a day early and says, I'm sorry.

296
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,900
Then I expected an incident once.

297
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,900
This is the agent.

298
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,900
Yeah.

299
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,900
Miss, this is Michael.

300
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,900
Hello, Michael.

301
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,900
So in so agency, I'm afraid to have a very bad.

302
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,900
That's a bad news.

303
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,900
That's a good thing.

304
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,900
And it just started.

305
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,900
What?

306
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,900
Everything.

307
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,900
What?

308
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,900
Your boobs.

309
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,900
No.

310
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,900
Everything was falling.

311
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,900
Your boobs.

312
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,900
You had to pick him up off the floor, boy.

313
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,900
No.

314
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,900
Everything.

315
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,900
And you said, well, you don't have the house.

316
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,900
Somebody else.

317
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,900
And I said, oh, what happened?

318
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,900
Because I thought he was enough.

319
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,900
But that's the envelope.

320
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,900
What he explained actually ahead of everything.

321
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,900
We offered like 12 or 13% over the asking price.

322
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,900
Yeah.

323
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,900
Now first the asking price.

324
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,900
That's how you start.

325
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,900
Then you're here late.

326
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,900
Well, there is already somebody over the asking price.

327
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,900
Uh-huh.

328
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,900
But we have so many people interested.

329
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,900
So what we're probably going to do at the end is make a couple of envelopes.

330
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,900
Put their best offer and the situation you're in.

331
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,900
Put it in there and give it to the vendors.

332
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,900
Yeah.

333
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,900
The vendors.

334
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,900
The people who sell the house.

335
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,900
That's the vendor.

336
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,900
Never knew that.

337
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,900
Vendor.

338
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,900
What's a vendor, you know?

339
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
It sounds like ice creams.

340
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,900
That's what a vendor is.

341
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,900
Exactly.

342
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,900
At an Albert Square.

343
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,900
They're all vendors.

344
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,900
I know.

345
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,900
So.

346
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,900
And then they will decide.

347
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,900
And sometimes it's not even the highest.

348
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,900
But if the situation is better.

349
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,900
It goes faster than they will choose.

350
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,900
Yeah.

351
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,900
I thought it was a bad idea from the beginning.

352
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,900
I said, yeah, but ask the vendors.

353
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,900
You know?

354
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,900
The vendors.

355
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,900
What they would like to have.

356
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,900
Yeah.

357
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,900
To take it off the freaking market.

358
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,900
And they said, well, I will ask them.

359
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,900
Mrs. Curry.

360
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,900
But the very decent and very old fashioned people.

361
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,900
Yeah.

362
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,900
And they thought it was not a very good idea because it's not nice for the other people.

363
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,900
And I said, this is business with focus.

364
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,900
And they went.

365
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,900
They want the money that they actually want for the, you know?

366
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,900
Did you say the line?

367
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,900
You said it just like that.

368
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,900
Yeah.

369
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,900
Yeah.

370
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
But you did.

371
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,900
To American probably.

372
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,900
Uh-huh.

373
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,900
And it's a pardon.

374
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,900
Pardon.

375
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,900
Pardon.

376
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,900
I didn't mean to be so proud.

377
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,900
Yeah.

378
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,900
It's very emotional.

379
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,900
It's very emotional.

380
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,900
But I said, can you could you please ask them that?

381
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,900
So he came back after a couple of hours.

382
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,900
Because I noticed that English people take their time.

383
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,900
If they say, I'll call you back.

384
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,900
That means three, four hours late.

385
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,900
Yeah.

386
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,900
In America means like.

387
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,900
I'll call you back.

388
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,900
Exactly.

389
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,900
Sometimes they don't call back at all.

390
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,900
Uh, that's cool.

391
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,900
They have, you have to call them again.

392
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,900
Yeah.

393
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,900
I don't have very good business.

394
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,900
Sorry, Mrs. Curry.

395
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,900
I was very, very, I was very busy.

396
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,900
I had a couple of meetings.

397
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,900
Yes.

398
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,900
I'm so sorry.

399
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,900
And then when they say the, the way they say it, I'm so sorry.

400
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,900
You believe in right away.

401
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,900
I've noticed with some of the business.

402
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,900
They're doing here that they kind of appreciate the straightforward American way of doing it.

403
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,900
Oh, they do.

404
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,900
They do.

405
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,900
They actually do.

406
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,900
And they knew that I was serious about it.

407
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,900
Yeah.

408
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,900
And so they did ask.

409
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,900
And, you know, they did.

410
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,900
But now they end up actually with less.

411
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,900
Then I said, they could have asked me.

412
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,900
Yeah.

413
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,900
You know what I mean?

414
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,900
So it is stupid idea.

415
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,900
Don't ever do this again.

416
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,900
No, I mean not that, but with envelope.

417
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,900
Oh, thank you.

418
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,900
It disappointed about that.

419
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,900
And who knows?

420
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,900
It might fall through.

421
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,900
Yeah.

422
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,900
This is the crazy thing.

423
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,900
Because it means absolutely nothing.

424
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,900
In fact, we already went back and bit more than the, than the winning bit.

425
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,900
So Michael said, yeah.

426
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,900
Well, you know you never knew that.

427
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,900
You never knew that.

428
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,900
But you just has no.

429
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,900
Yeah.

430
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,900
You never know what happens, Mrs. Curry.

431
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,900
It might be a little bit wobbly.

432
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,900
And I said, well, one thing.

433
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,900
We're not wobbly.

434
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,900
You want to come back to us.

435
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,900
We're not wobbly at all.

436
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,900
We're not wobbly.

437
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,900
So what do you know what?

438
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,900
We learned something here.

439
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,900
Yeah.

440
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,900
We learned that the system sucks.

441
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,900
Exactly.

442
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,900
I was very frustrated.

443
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,900
You know, and if we find a house that is,

444
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,900
there has none of these problems.

445
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,900
That means nobody wants a house.

446
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,900
Exactly.

447
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,900
But this was very popular.

448
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
It was a nice house.

449
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,900
It was a very nice house.

450
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,900
It was in three weeks' time.

451
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,900
If I were here, I might have been able to have a different,

452
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,900
I just, I feel guilty that I wasn't here to help you.

453
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,900
Yeah, you left me here.

454
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,900
No, it doesn't matter.

455
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,900
Oh, you're telling me I couldn't, I've done,

456
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,900
I'm not doing a right job.

457
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,900
No, no, that's not what I'm saying.

458
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,900
I guess what I'm saying is,

459
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,900
I'm always going to wonder if I was here,

460
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,900
could I have changed the outcome?

461
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,900
With a voice like that, you might.

462
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,900
Hello.

463
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,900
Because you didn't.

464
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,900
Yeah, you.

465
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,900
I'd like to.

466
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,900
Could have, I'd like to take a look at your house.

467
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,900
The Mrs.

468
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,900
Yeah, maybe she was very sensitive for that.

469
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,900
You know, you don't know.

470
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,900
She's a sensitive Mrs.

471
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,900
She's very sensitive.

472
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,900
She's very nice.

473
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,900
I met her, both of them are very nice.

474
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,900
Hmm.

475
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,900
So what else happened?

476
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,900
Yeah, I have to just breathe out, exhale.

477
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,900
Yeah, there'll be another house.

478
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,900
I'm a bit disappointed.

479
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,900
There will be another house.

480
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
You know there will be another house.

481
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,900
I know.

482
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,900
Remember, it was, it was the horny castle.

483
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,900
It was the bomb diggy, and then it was the foamshizzle.

484
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,900
It doesn't matter.

485
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,900
Every time, I just, you know how I was just.

486
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,900
You know how I was just.

487
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,900
You know how I was just.

488
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,900
I know.

489
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,900
Yes, you do.

490
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,900
And the moment I move on, then I, you know, I think, okay.

491
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,900
Oh, I could do this.

492
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,900
I'm happy you know.

493
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:02,900
We'll get the rundown of what's coming up on the pod show on serious stars one

494
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,900
or two, which this show is a simultaneously cast on.

495
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,900
Pacific Coast, Hellway next.

496
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,900
Then after that dawn and drew.

497
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,900
And then soccer girl will be on tonight at, what is that eight o'clock?

498
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,900
You've heard soccer girl how much you?

499
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,900
Yeah.

500
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,900
Yeah.

501
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:25,900
We have, sod, our, our search specialist is like, he has dreams about soccer girl.

502
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,900
Really?

503
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,900
Yeah.

504
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:33,900
I promise them, like, a mud wrestle between Dawn from Dawn and Drew and soccer girl.

505
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,900
Oh, Dawn is going to win this.

506
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,900
I think Dawn will kick her ass here.

507
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,900
Don't want her to stop of you.

508
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,900
No.

509
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,900
Dude.

510
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,900
She's strong.

511
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,900
She's strong.

512
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,900
She's strong.

513
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,900
She's strong.

514
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,900
Peed up, show.

515
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,900
You'll like this episode.

516
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,900
This is about, do you know that there are people who are immune to weed?

517
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,900
Yeah.

518
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,900
Turns out he's one of them.

519
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,900
Oh, whatever you do.

520
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,900
Aspirant and weed.

521
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,900
Aspirant and weed.

522
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,900
Aspirant doesn't work.

523
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,900
And the smoking weed just does not get stoned.

524
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,900
Oh, he misses maybe something in his brain.

525
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,900
Oh, well.

526
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,900
I don't.

527
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,900
I don't need to know about the weed to know that.

528
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,900
He's working for us.

529
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,900
Isn't that saying enough?

530
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,900
Email girl tell her to come on after digital floods and then imagine why

531
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,900
I'm seeing with East Radio followed by the Frank Truth, your favorite show.

532
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,900
Brian, no.

533
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,900
Yeah.

534
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,900
That's a cool last show.

535
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,900
That's tonight on the pod show.

536
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
Up until 10 Eastern time.

537
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,900
Hmm.

538
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,900
Yeah, so I really don't have much else to say because I told you,

539
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,900
I mean, you know, the things will pop up as as a home and we're around each

540
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,900
other.

541
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,900
Well, yeah.

542
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,900
Yeah.

543
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,900
I don't forget that you just came home.

544
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,900
So you're still a little bit kind of a shot off.

545
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,900
Oh, the ball ball.

546
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,900
Well, I was actually looking.

547
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
You brought me some magazines.

548
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,900
Yes.

549
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,900
And I was looking.

550
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,900
Did I bring good ones?

551
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,900
Yeah.

552
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,900
Do you know that don't sell pilot or flying magazine anymore?

553
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,900
Any of the key asks at San Francisco Airport that pisses me off?

554
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,900
I'm very interesting about flying.

555
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,900
What I've read about John F. Kennedy.

556
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
Do you think it sounds like bullshit?

557
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,900
Yeah.

558
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,900
Well, you know, maybe.

559
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,900
Yes.

560
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,900
That could have happened.

561
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,900
Yeah.

562
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,900
So many things.

563
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,900
Yeah.

564
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,900
So the story is that he was, but they said he was still over New York,

565
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,900
over White Plains, and that they couldn't reach him on the radio.

566
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,900
Yeah.

567
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,900
And that he was in the flight path of an American Airlines jetliner.

568
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,900
Yeah.

569
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,900
Which, you know, he must have been pretty high.

570
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,900
I had, I'd have to look at the map and see what the,

571
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,900
Yeah.

572
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,900
What the altitude rules are on that region.

573
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,900
But that's not where he crashed.

574
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,900
No.

575
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,900
But the thing that he crashed over Mars.

576
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,900
Nobody heard him.

577
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900
That could be something.

578
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,900
That is possible.

579
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,900
Yeah.

580
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,900
But you know, you've flown with me.

581
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,900
And how many times I said this cock suckers in the air and no,

582
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,900
you know, and the tower will literally say, you know,

583
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,900
you've got traffic coming away.

584
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,900
What are from whatever direction?

585
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,900
Hello.

586
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,900
Unknown.

587
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,900
We don't, we don't have monfrequency.

588
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,900
Yeah.

589
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,900
Because, you know, these people just flying around and just not.

590
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,900
Yeah.

591
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,900
Yeah.

592
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,900
It's fucking crazy.

593
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,900
So more people are doing that, actually.

594
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
Oh, well, maybe he was so busy.

595
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,900
No, but he could be on a different frequency.

596
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,900
Although, I think they try, I mean, this is the, they look.

597
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,900
It's national inquire.

598
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,900
So how, uh,

599
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,900
No, that's true.

600
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,900
Or it's worse.

601
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,900
It's the exam.

602
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,900
Or it's heard something.

603
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,900
Yeah.

604
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,900
So they say there's a cover up to the FAA and the NTSB,

605
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,900
that they covered that up.

606
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,900
For what?

607
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,900
Why would they cover that up?

608
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,900
That's what that would make no sense.

609
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,900
Makes no sense.

610
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,900
It was reading about, um, and I've read it already in English paper,

611
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,900
which is, you can trust.

612
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,900
Oh, yeah.

613
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,900
Thank you for prefacing that.

614
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,900
Scary spies and Eddie Murphy.

615
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,900
That blew me away.

616
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,900
He just got divorced from the beautiful wife.

617
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,900
gorgeous.

618
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,900
And now he's getting married to scary spies.

619
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,900
He's got five kids with her.

620
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,900
Five, uh, I think.

621
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,900
No, I think three and he had two from his first marriage.

622
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,900
He's been married for a time.

623
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,900
Okay.

624
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,900
And now.

625
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,900
I was going to get married to scary spies.

626
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,900
No, Mel B's.

627
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,900
I don't know.

628
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,900
It was a lot younger than he is, but that doesn't mean anything.

629
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,900
But I don't think she's that.

630
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,900
You know, no, no, no.

631
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,900
No, I think she's.

632
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,900
Well, she's 38, 39.

633
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,900
And he's maybe 45.

634
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,900
It's not that.

635
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,900
Yeah, yeah, it's not that big a difference.

636
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,900
Not at all.

637
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,900
No, no, no, no.

638
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,900
Okay.

639
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,900
But she has never really been very deep.

640
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,900
Well, it might give him a little bit, sort of a,

641
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,900
a young injection.

642
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,900
Something that he maybe needs because we're easy.

643
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,900
I wouldn't inject that.

644
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,900
But I wouldn't inject Mel B with your penis.

645
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,900
I do not.

646
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,900
She does not turn me on at all.

647
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,900
No, but maybe for either but no, but nobody.

648
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,900
I always thought of her like, she's a very sexy woman.

649
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,900
Really?

650
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,900
Oh, no.

651
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,900
No.

652
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,900
No.

653
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,900
I don't know.

654
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,900
Scary spies.

655
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,900
Does that ring a bell?

656
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,900
Does that make you think of anything?

657
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,900
Scary spies.

658
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,900
She was the scary spies.

659
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,900
She reminds me of downtown Julie Brown and that really pisses me off.

660
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,900
No, maybe I thought she was, she had guts or something.

661
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,900
That's why she was scary.

662
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,900
Yeah, the gut hang out all the way.

663
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,900
Yeah.

664
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:17,900
So that, then I saw that Pamela Anderson is back with David Spade.

665
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,900
No, that's had a locklear.

666
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,900
Oh, that's right.

667
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,900
That was funny too.

668
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,900
David.

669
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,900
David Spade and Heather Locklear.

670
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,900
That's a good combination.

671
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,900
You know, that is very nice because it gives hope to nerds like me.

672
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,900
I think he's a lovely nerd.

673
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,900
I like him.

674
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,900
Yeah, that's I know, but she sees that.

675
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,900
Yeah, I see something very sexy there.

676
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,900
I see something sexy in her too.

677
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
Well, her.

678
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,900
Yeah, I don't know.

679
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,900
Sure.

680
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,900
I think she's sexy.

681
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,900
She needs some humor.

682
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,900
Is David Spade on the list now all of a sudden?

683
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
There is no list.

684
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,900
Yeah, there is a list.

685
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,900
Come on.

686
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,900
Well, let's start a list.

687
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,900
I think he's so funny.

688
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,900
So he's on the list.

689
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,900
People who are so funny are on the list.

690
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,900
I love that.

691
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,900
You know, I love that.

692
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,900
If we ever hook up with Heather and David, we're all the list.

693
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,900
They're on the list.

694
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,900
Wow.

695
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,900
Okay.

696
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,900
What I said is a nay.

697
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,900
A nay.

698
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,900
A nay.

699
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,900
No, no, no.

700
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,900
Pamela Anderson, you said that already.

701
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,900
And kids.

702
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,900
Kid rock.

703
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,900
Kid rock.

704
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,900
Do you know that you know Aaron.

705
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,900
Tell us that.

706
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,900
You know Aaron Brcell, the podpimp.

707
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,900
Do you know?

708
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,900
Yeah, you do.

709
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,900
You've met him.

710
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,900
He does our promotions marketing.

711
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,900
Big guy.

712
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,900
Really big guy.

713
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,900
Yeah.

714
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,900
Yeah.

715
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,900
Yeah.

716
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,900
He flew.

717
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,900
Because, you know, where everyone's going back and forth between the San Francisco and London

718
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,900
for podcha, you guys.

719
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,900
He flew from San Francisco to London.

720
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
And he sat next to Pamela Anderson.

721
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,900
The entire trip.

722
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,900
I wanted to beat him senseless.

723
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,900
How unfair is that?

724
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,900
I fly with the hip airline.

725
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,900
Yeah, with like virgin.

726
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,900
I never, what I get like pussy cat dolls.

727
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,900
Yeah.

728
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,900
Yeah.

729
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,900
Imagine sitting next to Pamela Anderson for 10 hours.

730
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,900
Yeah.

731
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,900
Oh, man.

732
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,900
She's sweet.

733
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,900
I've heard.

734
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,900
And the way she.

735
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,900
That's exactly what he says.

736
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,900
Yeah, she's very sweet.

737
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,900
I think she was alone.

738
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,900
She wasn't with her kids.

739
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,900
Yeah.

740
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,900
She's always with the boys.

741
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,900
Always.

742
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,900
Oh, playing with them.

743
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,900
Going everywhere.

744
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,900
She's a great mom.

745
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,900
That's not everywhere.

746
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,900
Not always because she was on the flight with Aaron.

747
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,900
She was.

748
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,900
Yeah.

749
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,900
That's right.

750
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,900
How come I don't get to say, huh?

751
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,900
I get like, I don't get any celebrities on virgin.

752
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,900
Where are the celebrities?

753
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,900
On virgin.

754
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,900
I never see them.

755
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,900
Yeah.

756
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,900
Never.

757
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,900
You're right.

758
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,900
Except for the pussy cat dolls.

759
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,900
No, we had that John, you know.

760
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,900
Johnny Vegas.

761
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,900
No.

762
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,900
Don't you Vegas who was a named.

763
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,900
Yeah.

764
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,900
No.

765
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,900
No, no, no, no.

766
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,900
Don't rub it in.

767
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,900
Didn't he?

768
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,900
Yeah.

769
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,900
Yeah.

770
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,900
Don't say like you're happy.

771
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,900
You know, because we tried to be nice to him.

772
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,900
But he had an attitude.

773
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,900
So now.

774
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,900
He gets it back.

775
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,900
He flopped.

776
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,900
She put a curse on him.

777
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,900
Yeah.

778
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,900
You have to be nice to me.

779
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,900
Yes.

780
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,900
If you're not nice to the lady Patricia.

781
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,900
Yeah.

782
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,900
Then you, then you will flop.

783
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,900
Yeah.

784
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,900
Oh, yeah.

785
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,900
You will flop.

786
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,900
Ha.

787
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,900
Ha.

788
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,900
Okay.

789
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,900
So that was the only one that I ever actually saw.

790
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:13,900
Have you ever been sat next to a celebrity on an airplane?

791
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,900
No.

792
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,900
Not in airplane.

793
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,900
No.

794
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,900
Where did you sit next to a celebrity on a boat?

795
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,900
Well, we're in couple of shows.

796
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,900
Yeah.

797
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,900
And I mean, it has to be like a happenstance.

798
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,900
You know, like a real cool incident.

799
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,900
No more.

800
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,900
Yeah.

801
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,900
I flew with a, there's a point.

802
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,900
I slept with her.

803
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,900
Yeah.

804
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,900
I know.

805
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,900
Yeah.

806
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,900
We had a red eye from Los Angeles.

807
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,900
Yeah.

808
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,900
She slept together.

809
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,900
Oh, yeah.

810
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,900
Yeah.

811
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,900
She's beautiful.

812
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,900
Is she still with a, was she?

813
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,900
Waga mama.

814
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,900
What does that supposed to be?

815
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,900
She looks like a waga mama.

816
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,900
Those of you listening to us on serious.

817
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,900
You're not going to hear the rest of my story about Daisy Fuentes.

818
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,900
Unless you go to daily source code.com and download the show.

819
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,900
Pacific Coast Hellway.

820
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,900
Next for you guys.

821
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,900
You always had a thing for her.

822
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,900
I love Daisy.

823
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,900
Yeah.

824
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,900
I didn't.

825
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,900
She had thick ankles.

826
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,900
You always said mama.

827
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,900
Mama.

828
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,900
Mama.

829
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,900
Mama.

830
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,900
Yeah.

831
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,900
Mama.

832
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,900
Cheetah with her.

833
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,900
Cheetah with her.

834
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,900
Yeah.

835
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,900
But she was nice.

836
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,900
Very nice.

837
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,900
One of the few people that I really got along well with that MTV.

838
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,900
Yeah.

839
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,900
Very, very nice.

840
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,900
But she was also like me.

841
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,900
She was kind of an outsider.

842
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,900
Yet fully entrenched.

843
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,900
You know, MTV celebrated the 25th birthday on Monday.

844
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,900
I think Monday or two.

845
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,900
I bet they didn't tell you.

846
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,900
No.

847
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,900
Well, approached you.

848
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,900
No, no, but MTV did nothing.

849
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,900
They did celebrate it all.

850
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,900
Oh.

851
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,900
Yeah.

852
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,900
It was not worth celebrating.

853
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,900
I think it makes kind of sense.

854
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,900
You know, the kids who were watching MTV now, they weren't alive.

855
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,900
When MTV started, you know, it's like, why?

856
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,900
And, you know, VH1 did some stuff.

857
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,900
You know, VH1 member VH1 used to be the Kenny G channel.

858
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,900
Yeah.

859
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,900
The history of Metallica is not TV.

860
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,900
Right.

861
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,900
But now the history of Metallica is on VH1.

862
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,900
Oh, that's a change.

863
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,900
Right.

864
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,900
So VH1 is, but it's, it feels, it makes me, it makes me feel old, really.

865
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,900
Yeah.

866
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,900
It's just silly.

867
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,900
It's not the same.

868
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,900
No.

869
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,900
Of course, it's not the same.

870
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,900
And the last top of the pops.

871
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,900
You saw that?

872
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,900
How was it?

873
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,900
How was the last top of the pops?

874
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,900
Well, it was actually old.

875
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:24,900
Top of the pops, which started in 40, almost 42 years ago, in 1964, which is the

876
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,900
longest running pop show in history, as far as I know.

877
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,900
Well, did you know that it was a time?

878
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,900
Yeah.

879
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,900
I knew that.

880
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,900
That it wasn't hip to be on the top of the pops.

881
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,900
Did they say that?

882
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,900
Yeah.

883
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,900
They said that.

884
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,900
Really?

885
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,900
Yeah.

886
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,900
There was a time to say that.

887
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,900
During, uh, well, I'll be doing this.

888
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,900
It started when they had too many, uh, wumbles and plumbles.

889
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,900
Yeah.

890
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,900
They do have a lot of that stupid shit on.

891
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,900
Yeah.

892
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,900
Yeah.

893
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,900
That's typical BBC because then the BBC wants to promote something from another show.

894
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,900
Exactly.

895
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,900
And they changed every time they had another producer with other ideas who had to make, you know,

896
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,900
with this last guy, I forget his name, who was doing the production.

897
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,900
You know, top of the pops is in like 20 countries.

898
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,900
Yeah.

899
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,900
They sold it.

900
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,900
That was a good idea.

901
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,900
Yeah.

902
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,900
And I did it very well.

903
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,900
He brought it back to basic.

904
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,900
Yeah.

905
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,900
You know, just music.

906
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,900
And if you cannot sing it, uh, live, which is understandable.

907
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,900
Well, you used to understand the rule.

908
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,900
If you have a routine, you're dancing.

909
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,900
But the rule used to be with top of the pops.

910
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,900
I remember this very, very clearly.

911
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,900
Um, because of a union rule, some weird union rule.

912
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,900
You had to sing live or had to do that.

913
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,900
So, so either you had to sing live on the show or you had to record a new vocal.

914
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,900
Yeah.

915
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,900
Only the vocal.

916
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,900
I don't think it was the instruments.

917
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,900
Only the vocal.

918
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,900
Well, no.

919
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,900
There was a time that, uh, the also you had to use English musicians.

920
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,900
English musicians.

921
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,900
Right.

922
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,900
Yeah.

923
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,900
And you're thinking like, my God, we worked on this so long.

924
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,900
And now we have to do it in one afternoon, you know.

925
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,900
And that was the end of the series.

926
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,900
Because the producer, um, that was, yeah, it was the stars.

927
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,900
And we didn't do it.

928
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,900
Because it was too hard.

929
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,900
And the producer, yeah.

930
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,900
Everyone said, well, no, that's not that easy.

931
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,900
No.

932
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,900
We're not going to get that sound.

933
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,900
We're not going to do it.

934
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,900
Wow.

935
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,900
So you didn't perform on top of the pops for your artistic integrity.

936
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,900
Yes.

937
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,900
Yes.

938
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,900
Actually, yes.

939
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,900
Actually, um, one of the couple of producers came, uh, this week.

940
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:33,900
And told, um, uh, told, I don't know, in the show.

941
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,900
In the last show.

942
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,900
Yeah.

943
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,900
No.

944
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,900
It was nothing to show.

945
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,900
It was, it was about top of the pops.

946
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,900
And they said that, uh, well, a lot of X were right.

947
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,900
Not to do it.

948
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,900
Because it is a hard work.

949
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,900
You're looking for a great sound.

950
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,900
Yeah.

951
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,900
Really, really working harder than that.

952
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,900
And then you got to go and walk it all up to the TV.

953
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,900
Right.

954
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,900
And that TV sound is always so good.

955
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,900
Anyway, isn't it?

956
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,900
Not at all.

957
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,900
So, uh, I was right.

958
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,900
And so I was, uh, I produced a sound.

959
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,900
We didn't do it.

960
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,900
I picked up a book at the airport.

961
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,900
And, uh, something was, it's like the 10 homeless second.

962
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,900
Is it really good?

963
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,900
Not for you.

964
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,900
You wouldn't give a shit.

965
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,900
Oh.

966
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,900
Oh, interesting.

967
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,900
Yeah.

968
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,900
I don't know.

969
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,900
Well, I had this reason of saying this.

970
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,900
Oh.

971
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,900
It's the little blue book of advertising.

972
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,900
52 small ideas that can make a big difference.

973
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,900
Oh.

974
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,900
Um, forward written by a guy.

975
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,900
I know Jerry Delafimina, who is a legendary advertising.

976
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,900
Yeah.

977
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,900
And it's not, it's not really about advertising per se.

978
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,900
It's about, um,

979
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,900
Customers in general.

980
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,900
Just what, what customers want.

981
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,900
Oh, and what they want to see.

982
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,900
Well, and, and most of the, you know what it is with, with all this.

983
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:48,900
Micro marketing and viral marketing and, and internet and cell phones.

984
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,900
Advertising hasn't changed.

985
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,900
People still want the basic things.

986
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,900
Yeah.

987
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,900
They still want a good feeling when they, when they see it,

988
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,900
Oh, see, you're here and advertising.

989
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,900
Right.

990
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,900
That's really true.

991
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,900
And so a lot of it is just going back to the basics and one thing,

992
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,900
I had 10 hours.

993
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,900
So, uh, one thing that, um, they keep coming back on on the book.

994
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,900
These two guys, these writers is,

995
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,900
know your customer and I thought to myself,

996
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,900
I really don't know my customer because, you know,

997
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,900
the customer that we have right now is people listening to this.

998
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,900
I don't, I have no idea who these people,

999
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,900
and yeah, some of them I do, but I really don't know.

1000
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,900
No.

1001
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,900
So I thought why not ask the audience to call in.

1002
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,900
Uh, the voice mail numbers.

1003
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,900
Get your phone out so you can pre-program the number.

1004
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,900
In a second.

1005
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,900
Um, I just want to know your name, how old you are,

1006
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,900
where you're from, what you do,

1007
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,900
and then if you're a folder or scruncher,

1008
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,900
of course, that's.

1009
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,900
Of course.

1010
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,900
Every single phone call I get now is,

1011
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,900
Oh, and uh.

1012
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,900
Now you get some information from them.

1013
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,900
Well, yes, I think that information is pretty interesting.

1014
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,900
Yeah.

1015
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,900
You know, the richest guy I know,

1016
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,900
who's probably,

1017
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,900
a hundred million area,

1018
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,900
if not close to a billionaire,

1019
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,900
God knows how much money he has.

1020
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,900
You know him too.

1021
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,900
Ray.

1022
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,900
Hmm.

1023
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,900
He's a scruncher.

1024
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,900
So that's interesting.

1025
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,900
I'm a folder.

1026
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,900
Am I destined to fail?

1027
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,900
If I mission towards incredible wealth.

1028
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,900
I think it's about people who are in a hurry

1029
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,900
or take their time.

1030
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,900
Hmm.

1031
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,900
Interesting.

1032
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,900
Well, so I want to build a hypothesis on that.

1033
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,900
So I just want,

1034
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,900
I just want to know it's listening.

1035
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,900
What they do.

1036
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,900
Hmm.

1037
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,900
And it'd be great if we had people who don't have podcasts,

1038
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,900
but I'm interested in the podcasters too.

1039
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,900
Yeah.

1040
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,900
You are they.

1041
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,900
What are they?

1042
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,900
Yeah.

1043
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,900
And why do they listen?

1044
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,900
Why do they listen?

1045
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,900
You know?

1046
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,900
We're kind of job.

1047
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,900
And what do they like?

1048
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,900
What is there?

1049
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,900
Yeah.

1050
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,900
Because then we can determine what we can do.

1051
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,900
That'll be better.

1052
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,900
I think, you know,

1053
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,900
I think our audience is older than I thought.

1054
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,900
Well, I think so too.

1055
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,900
I think it starts around.

1056
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,900
God.

1057
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,900
I hope there's some really hot girls that listen to the show.

1058
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,900
Look at people we meet in the train here.

1059
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,900
When we go by train to London.

1060
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,900
And you see people with iPods?

1061
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,900
Yeah.

1062
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,900
They're not young either.

1063
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,900
No.

1064
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,900
You're right.

1065
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,900
They've got money.

1066
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,900
Sitting there, relaxing, listening to it.

1067
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,900
And I think, what are they listening to?

1068
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,900
Yeah.

1069
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,900
Well, so I arrived at Heathrow.

1070
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,900
And it was very, very quiet.

1071
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,900
And so you go through the fast track.

1072
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,900
I love fast track.

1073
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,900
You get this little purple card.

1074
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,900
I know.

1075
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,900
Hi.

1076
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,900
I just walked right up.

1077
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,900
And so there were two girls, two immigration agents.

1078
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,900
We were really, you know, young women.

1079
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,900
Yeah.

1080
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,900
And one was dark hair and one was blonde.

1081
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,900
It was really funny because I walked right.

1082
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,900
There's no one there.

1083
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,900
I walked right up.

1084
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,900
And I'm like.

1085
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,900
Which one?

1086
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,900
Which one?

1087
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,900
The go.

1088
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,900
I don't want to insult anybody.

1089
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,900
Which one did you choose?

1090
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,900
Well, it's interesting because the dark hair girl who was definitely less attractive.

1091
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,900
Because you know, I'd like blondes anyway.

1092
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,900
Yeah.

1093
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,900
She said, well, she was anyone you want.

1094
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,900
And she almost apologetically said, okay.

1095
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,900
You can go see her.

1096
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,900
I said, no.

1097
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,900
You spoke to me first.

1098
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,900
I want to hang out with you.

1099
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,900
Oh, you made her day.

1100
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,900
Oh, totally.

1101
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,900
Yeah.

1102
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,900
The fuck was I talking about?

1103
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,900
Well, about the choice.

1104
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,900
Which one you choose?

1105
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,900
No.

1106
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,900
The reason I said it was for some reason.

1107
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:06,900
Well, it was a wonderful that you went through the short term memories going.

1108
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,900
Been through what?

1109
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,900
Before that.

1110
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,900
I brought up the story for a reason.

1111
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,900
What were you saying before that?

1112
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,900
Quickly wind it.

1113
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,900
The hell are we talking about?

1114
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,900
I'm so fried.

1115
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,900
What were we just talking about before I started in the story?

1116
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,900
Well, about your customers.

1117
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,900
Oh, thank you.

1118
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,900
Yeah.

1119
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,900
No.

1120
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,900
The listeners.

1121
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,900
The writers.

1122
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,900
No, you're.

1123
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,900
So she says, what are you coming to do?

1124
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,900
Because, you know, of course, the paper.

1125
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,900
Even though we've done our paperwork, I still don't have the official visa.

1126
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,900
It's a small thing, but it, you know, I'm fucking lazy.

1127
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,900
And so I said, you know, I'll be here for 10 days.

1128
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:45,900
Which is true because within 10 days, all have gone to Holland, you know, which all of it makes sense.

1129
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,900
It don't really care.

1130
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,900
Yeah.

1131
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,900
Oh, what kind of business are you doing?

1132
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,900
Well, you know, and I mentioned the name of the company that we're doing business with.

1133
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,900
And she says, well, well, tell me about it.

1134
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,900
She was, yeah, you know, sometimes I do this.

1135
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,900
If whether they're interested or they want to see if I'm smuggling.

1136
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,900
Well, they're bored.

1137
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,900
They're bored, probably.

1138
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,900
They'll be heard of podcasting.

1139
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,900
Then the, the blonde says, oh, yes.

1140
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,900
Oh, yeah.

1141
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,900
For the podcasting.

1142
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,900
And so we got into this whole thing.

1143
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,900
Yeah, you know, they were, they were young.

1144
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,900
Yeah.

1145
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,900
Between, I'd say they were on 25.

1146
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,900
Oh, yeah.

1147
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,900
That's you.

1148
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,900
And so she heard of podcasting.

1149
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,900
Mm-hmm.

1150
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,900
That was cool.

1151
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,900
Yeah.

1152
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,900
I think that's why I told the story.

1153
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,900
I have no idea.

1154
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,900
I don't like to pay off as much as I went.

1155
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,900
I'm pretty sure I messed it up.

1156
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,900
Okay.

1157
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,900
So voicemail.

1158
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,900

1165
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,900
Good job.

Well, I only play a song.

1169
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,900
I got a really cool song here.

1170
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,900
And then, and then we'll wrap it up.

1171
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,900
Okay?

1172
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,900
Listen to the lyrics of this song.

1173
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,900
I think you like it.

1174
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,900
I like it.

1175
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,900
I like it.

1176
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,900
We're up now.

1177
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,900
Chocolate cake makes my poor stomach ape.

1178
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,900
And all those pills are too much for me to take.

1179
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,900
Don't like cocaine, because it makes me all up tight.

1180
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,900
We're coffee and reefer makes me feel alright.

1181
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,900
First of all, method, make you hide.

1182
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,900
That's too much.

1183
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,900
But I've never liked going five days without a sniff.

1184
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,900
As it makes you say stupid things like.

1185
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,900
We're coffee and reefer makes you feel alright.

1186

The beans are making fly.

1189
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,900
All the bug will make you slow.

1190
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,900
Shoes, feet, balls will make you snow your stereo.

1191
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,900
But you've never heard of going in hawk.

1192
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,900
For a cup of Joe.

1193
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,900
You know the crank will end you ride in a crank.

1194
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,900
Smoke that nasty crack and you want to rob a bank.

1195
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,900
Forget the nicotine and cannot be.

1196
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,900
Ben's a dream.

1197
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:07,900
Try golfing and reef before a real mellow scene.

Don't answer the phone.

Just try to spend them coming out.

1228

It's played by independent and indie artists

00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,900
