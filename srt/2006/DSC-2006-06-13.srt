This is Chris from Dallas.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,280
Hello, right now.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,280
I'm taking a nice drive.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,280
It's 150 mile drive.

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,280
Got my DMV for the Charlie.

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,280
On the iPod and that got to tell you a love it.

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,280
Just calling it for the legitimate man.

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,280
She has seen what you don't know.

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,280
Let it brought her here to this place.

19
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,280
It's amazing what this life can put you through.

20
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,280
Yes, it is.

21
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,280
There's a choice to make in all the things you do.

22
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

23
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:39,280

24
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,480
I wish that there was something I could see

25
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:50,280
I could feel her

26
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,280
And I'm like, yeah, can't remember

27
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,280
He's gone, I'm like, yeah, yeah

28
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,280
So she lost in time and stay

29
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

30
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,280
I wonder what brothers do this place

31
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,280
He's goin' in a dream

32
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,280
He's supposed to lost in time

33
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280
And stay

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

35
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,280
I wonder what brothers do

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
This place and there's preparation

37
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
For Mom and Mary's command

38
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,280
And I want to chase Fist

39
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,280
He's supposed to lost in time and stay

40
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,280
I wonder what are them

41
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,280
I wonder what promise you this place is in my voice

42
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:49,280
I'm not eating, she's lost in time and space

43
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:58,280
I wonder what promise you this place is in my voice

44
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,280
I'm not eating, she's lost in time and space

45
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,280
I'm not taking this place, she's lost in time and space

46
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,280
I'm not eating, she's lost in time

47
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,280
I wonder what promise you this place is in my voice

48
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,280
I'm not eating, she's lost in time

49
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,280
I'm not eating, you're lost in time and space

50
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,280
Hey wait, are you using one, stick that in your crackby, bud.

51
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,280
Natalie Brown, I wonder kicking off two days

52
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,840
Daily source code coming to you from the curry condo in an overcast and kind of dark

53
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,160
Northern California the 24th floor. I'm looking out over the bay. I'm seeing clouds

54
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,520
I'm looking out towards the mountains. I'm seeing clouds coming rolling in. It's okay after

55
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,640
After all the hot weather we've had in the UK. It's all right. Hey everybody, how you doing?

56
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,480
This is the Daily Source code episode number

57
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:02,000
four hundred and three. Wow. So apologies for yesterday that we didn't get to share a show

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,720
together. But at the very last minute, actually Saturday is Patricia and I were on a way to

59
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,680
to visit my mom which we did flying of course and Patricia loved it.

60
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,640
Ron and I had a conversation. It's just so much stuff going on that it made a lot of sense for

61
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:26,320
me to come in a day early. Which of course means it? Which of course means that I don't have

62
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,280
my shirts from the dry cleaners. I forgot to bring half the stuff and normally bring it

63
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,960
when I get out of my rhythm man then it all seems to go to shit. But gonna be here for the next

64
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:44,640
couple weeks and we'll be bringing you the Charlie direct from the condo. Today of course the first time

65
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:52,320
I've actually set up with everything on the on the windows laptop. So my outline of the show notes

66
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,000
including cast blasts are all in this tiny teeny little screen which tells me I really got to get a

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,960
studio set up here. I'm gonna have time for this trip around and I think when yeah tomorrow

68
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,960
some furniture rise which Patricia and I ordered last time we were here. So I finally get my

69
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,960
dining room table and some chairs. I mean nice to have chairs in the condo. That would be novel

70
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:20,240
and the studio set up which isn't really a custom job. Like I have at home the my father

71
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,920
and law made for me but we found a baker's rack and it fits perfectly against this one wall that

72
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,040
really is wasted space in the condo. So everything will be up on racks. I'm gonna get a dedicated

73
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,000
machine here. I really should get a dedicated mixer and all that stuff as well. But everything seems

74
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,760
to be working fine for just now. Hey I've been missing them for a couple days. No not just days.

75
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,520
Maybe even a week and a half and all kinds of crap going on with him and comments their

76
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,760
blogger and thank goodness the man is back.

77
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,000
Hey I've been Roger Heyer. I had you mentioned that you're looking for new house and

78
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,040
gun fire and I want to let you know that I found a nice one bedroom to sell this.

79
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,200
Probably just a few doors away from my house. I think it would be splendid if you moved

80
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,360
at the road as you'd be able to come over to my house so nice could have teed

81
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,320
maybe some drugs I've got some more seen. It would save me having to walk all that

82
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,840
way to the usual wifi just to download some podcasts. Anyway I had to send my blog off this weekend

83
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,080
because coming to the blog goes report me to the police and I don't actually want to get into

84
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,100
any trouble. I know I sued a lot of people in the past to argue with him and I don't

85
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,080
want to be another one. I certainly don't want to make you liable for podcasts and

86
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,740
these ghost Hitler because we might end up in prison together and unfortunately a

87
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,000
beautiful man like you wouldn't last two minutes in the shower block. And what

88
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,080
worries me is that I didn't think podcasting has any rules or regulations but

89
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,080
it just looks like anyone with enough money and guilty secrets can control what

90
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,760
the other people say just like traditional media can explain what these rules are

91
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,360
so I can start blocking again and right now though it's quite a half to be

92
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,760
angry on a lovely day like today and being in the garden in my end to pants

93
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,760
listening to your voice we might move so soon. It's a very sweaty and content though

94
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,760
just wish you were here to share this right being with me. Thank you.

95
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,760
All right Roger. Actually at the mix we did and it's going to put in can I

96
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:32,760
be your B&H? You can be my B&H any time Roger? Yeah this thing has got to

97
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,760
be. But I think I have to jump in mediate if you've ever looked at curried.com

98
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,760
look at the comments underneath because I cross post daily source code there as well as

99
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,760
on daily source code dot com which is the official site and where you get the official

100
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,760
feed please that's where you need to get the podcast feed. There's such a stupid

101
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:54,760
stupid infantile thing going on between comic strip blogger some of Roger

102
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:01,760
is a jacic watcher dot it's it's annoying. Now I'm not a guy who moderates comments.

103
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,760
I have no time for it. I can't even moderate my email which means you know

104
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,760
way through the crap on email so not to do that for comments I don't I don't

105
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,760
think so. So with me it's either comments or no comments and if we can't stop all this

106
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,760
crap I'm just going to turn the comments off you know it it'll be a shame but it's just

107
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,760
it's not worth it so I've sent out to request to to all parties involved and

108
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:29,760
such a stop it stop already ruining the the comments. Oh ruination. By the way

109
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,760
interesting news it seems that Roger Smalls now has a gig with a BBC on what is

110
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:42,760
it called one click BBC. Now wasn't able to actually download the file I'm not quite sure

111
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,760
if if that's a podcast or not they have some kind of player that pops up when you access

112
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,760
the link and loan behold there was Roger doing an overview of the latest news on the net and

113
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,760
podcast and huge disclaimers from the BBC by the way saying that nothing Roger Smalls says

114
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,760
is represents the view point of the BBC or the general counsel of the BBC but

115
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,760
congratulations Roger I couldn't be happier and you know that whether we live next door

116
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,760
or not you're always welcome to come and filter my Wi-Fi and it's totally my pleasure.

117
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,760
More news from around the from around the weekend Robert Scobel has left Microsoft

118
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:28,760
is joining pod tech the technical the technology podcast network he'll be vice president

119
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:34,760
in charge of media which I guess he means that that means that he chooses shows the

120
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:40,760
join the network and works on the on the overall strategy congratulations to Robert

121
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,760
if you've never read his scobelizer weblog definitely check it out it was all

122
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,760
you know I even though this is this is great for Robert and I had quite a conversation with

123
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,760
Steve Gilmore about this I think it'll be on the Gilmore daily this week you know

124
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,760
I think it's a loss for certainly for blogging when it comes to well not not for

125
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,760
blood it's not a loss for blogging is it's a loss for people who want to know

126
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,760
what's going on inside Microsoft for some reason scobel just kind of you know

127
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,760
made the made the company more a bunch of nerds and geeks and he was like our port

128
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,760
through the firewall and I really enjoyed excuse me since sale this since sale

129
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,760
moment brought to you by the rock and roll geek show

130
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,760
for some reason it just felt like I was getting more information out of Microsoft

131
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,760
with having Robert there I think Microsoft messed up I think they made a huge mistake

132
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,760
by not keeping him on but congratulations to Robert can't wait to see what you're going to do

133
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,760
and of course I'll be moving to the bay area so that's my neck of the woods

134
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,760
50% of the time so look forward to hanging out with you once in a while Robert

135
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,760
this is a question I received from a lot of people

136
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,760
this particular one came from oh this is actually a comment from Jonathan

137
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,760
Adam sorry to hear about your mac issues for those you don't know after three

138
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,760
fried power books in a year I'm now working on the windows platform using the

139
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,760
notebook since most of your life is now online I'm curious to know if you have an

140
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,760
online solution for your on the outline or no dude I wish I did I wish

141
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,760
you know and I have a very simple so right now I'm using something called

142
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,760
whizz folders as an outline because on the outline if you have to use a

143
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,760
mac I think it comes pretty bundled like the light version comes pretty

144
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,760
bundled these days I love I love working without liners I love the

145
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,760
on the outline because you could easily drag a file right into it and it

146
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,760
would just be in the outline and it would know where it lived on your

147
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,760
hard drive and everything and this whizz folders kind of has that

148
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,760
capability but it's still not really the interface doesn't really work

149
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,760
for me that well yet if there were an online version where I could just

150
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,760
drag and drop files and clips and stuff into it gosh I would use that

I should have played that obviously I should have played that Friday I really

178
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,760
messed it up dude but two things I wanted to say first of all I'd like the fact that you're

179
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,760
doing that show the other thing is we hate musicals we do not like the musical

180
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,760
theater know we like theater we like shows but real musicals all men you got

181
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,760
to have a real good one for us to particularly for Patricia to like it and boy I'm

182
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:12,760
going to miss her while I'm here these you know the next few days or two weeks

183
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,760
because and yet the only thing I can think of is we maybe I get her on Skype

184
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,760
and we do something together but I don't know if it's going to be the same

185
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,760
and of course there's also Christina's pod save the queen like how am I going to do

186
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,760
that now I hadn't actually showed her cast blaster and half the studio is with me

187
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,760
and I don't want her to create it on a Skype headset or something although

188
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,760
I did say why don't you get one of those sexy boy friends of yours to hook up

189
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,760
a really good Skype headset mom will pay for it and then we'll try and record

190
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,760
the show that way because I really do want to keep the the consistency in

191
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,760
there's funny and what the office saying oh man you know how's Christina doing

192
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,760
as she enjoying the show and all I can say is well yes she loves the show you know

193
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,760
she loves doing it and she's just waiting for that pod show contract because

194
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,760
I don't know there's folks over at other networks that are getting pretty interested

715 a.m. you know I uh so I arrived yesterday Monday.

214
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,760
Uh oh wow this was pretty interesting so after a pretty un-eventful fight

215
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,760
you know it was 10 hours although actually we went so far up into the north

216
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,760
uh into the northern hemisphere up into the Arctic circle that the pilot actually

217
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,760
made mention of it that he never been routed that far up north and was beautiful

218
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:43,760
oh I mean just looking down onto uh ice caps and as we came down over uh

219
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,760
over the northwestern territories you know the volcanic uh land scape

220
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,760
the rocky mountains it was just a beautiful flight and I'm so glad I I slept for

221
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,760
probably about four four hours or something like that see I also saw some movies

222
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,760
what I see today you go can you remember oh uh E on flux which I think

223
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,760
I'd seen before but it was just it was at Charlize Theron.

224
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,760
I'll watch any movie that she's in.

225
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
What else did I see?

226
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
Uh oh man.

227
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,760
I'm a little fuzzy I'll see if I can come up with it later.

228
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:25,760
So I got in around uh 130 and uh interesting I got completely opened up

229
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,760
at customs that was new um and there was a lot of activity yesterday at San Francisco

230
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,760
at the airport you know customs activity lots of people there you know their suit

231
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,760
cases were being opened up and I got a pretty thorough drilling I have to say

232
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:46,760
uh even was asked to take off my jacket which has lots of zippered pockets

233
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,760
but they didn't look in that one that was already practicing.

234
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:56,760
Hey Ron I'm at the airport so to work out fine when straight to the office actually

235
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,760
after I dropped off my stuff and we had a couple meetings up until seven o'clock

236
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,760
so it was completely wiped out by the time I got home or my favorite sweet and sour

237
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,760
chicken from the Chinese guys around the corner built the studio got it ready

238
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,760
for this morning and went to bed straight away so I got a good seven hours

239
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,760
of sleep was up at five this morning going through all the backlog email.

240
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,760

267
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,760
been following the world cup looking for another update from from my

268
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:54,920
from my guys they're gonna be sending me one soon this week I presume. So even though I didn't see

269
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:01,000
oh I didn't see the Netherlands play on Sunday. Wow Robin was great and I must say I'm kind of

270
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,280
getting into it I got a little bit of World Cup fever and it was so cool to go Saturday morning

271
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,120
I had to fill up the car before we drove to the airport. So it was really early it was you know

272
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:17,160
730 and the the the gas station was just filled with cars and people buying big

273
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:25,800
crates of beer and crisps and you name it and flags everywhere everywhere England flags people wearing

274
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:31,560
England flag T shirts and tattoos and paint and the other pride is just unreal and then we flew to

275
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,200
the Netherlands and everything was orange and there were orange shirts and orange flags and

276
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,920
different money it was like going to a whole other country in just an hour and 15 minutes.

277
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,560
Unfortunately the US lost their first game three zip I still you know they have a chance still

278
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:54,040
and they are ranked I think fourth in the world so I'm really hoping that they do better it's hard

279
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,120
now I've got like three teams that I'm following and I really like them all for different reasons

280
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,400
and I'm affiliated with all three so any one of those three that wins will be great and

281
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,880
I'm not quite sure if it's if the world cup has any life to it in the States I'll figure that out in

282
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,880
the next couple of days and I have no idea who's playing today or what's going on but

283
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,640
definitely enjoying it the only real sporting event I can totally yeah and the Super Bowl I guess

284
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:26,440
it may be the world and maybe I guess any final game I like so lots of talk around the office

285
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:32,600
about me being on windows particularly because a lot of people have now purchased a

286
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,960
MacBook Pro and

287
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:44,040
they're running side-by-side windows and Mac applications very cool he in fact here's the listeners doing

288
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:49,160
exactly the same. Hey Adam this is York from Berlin Germany and I just wanted to tell you that I'm

289
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:54,680
actually recording this bit in Casplaster on parals on my iMac since you wanted to know

290
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:03,400
yeah and winners look like shit okay bye love you show don't go yeah it does look like shit doesn't it

291
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:09,320
but it works you're right the only game the village is not well should all it's English but it's

292
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,960
supposed to be said with a Welsh accent says Jamie Garner through Gmail Welsh is quite a hard

293
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,080
language to master and does slightly sound like cling on yes no kidding second thing

294
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:25,400
oh that's about taking the Jubilee line to Canary War. I'm getting so many comments about that

295
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,360
I'm the only game the village I wasn't it doesn't sound Welsh at all to me I watch those big brother guys

296
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,240
the housemates and they were speaking Welsh and it didn't sound at all like the only game the village

297
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,840
but I find it a fascinating language and there are Welsh podcasts and you know when we get

298
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:49,960
kicking with the show in the UK we'll definitely have a place for Welsh podcasting and for Irish as

299
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,840
well interesting love I was we're just trying to build it up we're just trying to make the show the show

300
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:03,400
something else I received oh I wish I had find uh oh now I gotta go back and look who sent this to me I'm

301
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:10,520
sorry uh how it's turned who of course is only uh one channel up from us on serious satellite radio

302
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,640
is definitely definitely listening to this show let me see if I can make this just before the

303
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:20,200
satellite window closed you know but I like the classic rewind and a classic vinyl I'm I'm on all the

304
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:28,680
time I'm on uh channel 9 that's the pulse I listen to the heavy metal thing I don't even

305
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:37,560
wish one when I work out sometimes I listen to Jay Thomas on um stars and sometimes I listen to that

306
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:44,360
iPod show with uh oh god that drives me crazy what's that guys name um curry yeah I like that

307
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:49,960
guy Adam Curry I like that guy an iPod expert I imagine somebody's sitting in I like a little room

308
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,720
you know broadcasting to nobody I don't know I just listen to that so I don't know what they're talking

309
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,960
about I'm trying to listen to the figs but then I can't I don't listen out here I listen to

310
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:05,080
serious left all right those of you listen to us on stars 102 Pacific Coast Hellway is next

311
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:11,560
that you know that really chaps me I have to say I really dig that you're having been a

312
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:18,120
stern junkie for years for years and still listen to him on serious I love that that's cool

313
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:26,600
he said I love that guy thank you that that is a huge compliment to me oh let's see what are we

314
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:32,440
doing here yeah people in their living room kind of in the kitchen on the bar in the kitchen

315
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:38,600
does it really matter I don't think so I really don't you know stern is he's smart man he's

316
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,160
he's just listening he's listening to everything that's going on he knows he knows what's what

317
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:49,560
people are doing and uh he knows that this really is the future of audio entertainment that's why

318
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:55,880
he's listening to it Steven Dawn said hey Adam I have a daughter who's turning 14 curious to know

319
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:02,200
what age do you let your daughter begin wearing makeup and perfume thanks Steve wow I think

320
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,480
Christina already had lipstick in her hands and all over face at the age of three and you know it's

321
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:14,280
so hard because what is what does a kid do a kid replicates what mom and dad are doing but going out

322
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,640
out of the I mean it all depends you know if I think it started very slowly Patricia being a

323
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:27,000
makeup expert hands down having her own cosmetics company of course it went very gradually I think

324
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,360
maybe she was you know a little bit of I shadow or maybe a little bit of mascara or something like

325
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,920
that and it really depends on what shades of stuff and how heavy the makeup is applied but

326
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,680
I think that she really eased into it but it's not like you flip the lights twitch and say okay

327
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,680
do whatever you want go out with you know with bright red lipstick I wouldn't let my wife go out

328
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,160
with bright red lipstick if it was too bright too red or not coordinated with her dress and she was

329
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:57,400
in handbag so it's all about you know what's the balance there but it's going to be very hard

330
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:03,480
you know to to set a particularly when kids or teenagers look around you pick up any magazine any

331
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:10,440
magazine and you'll see that there's not just makeup there's also a shitload of a photo shop and

332
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:17,560
go on on everybody looks so thin and pretty yeah I'm just a little flat think again listen to

333
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:24,440
you're not supposed to talk into the microphone so I this guy sent me a couple of voice comments

334
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:30,840
about about three nine or five where I got so pissed off about the plopping sounds etc and so

335
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,160
now he's telling me how and by the way this is you know you can this is a real shit quality

336
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:39,240
coming through on the voice mail line but he's telling me I'm not supposed to talk directly into

337
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,280
the microphone okay I know you've been doing an radio and broadcast and shit for a long time but

338
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:51,720
let me tell you what I've been working at a radio station for often on OPEC in years and I've seen

339
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:59,400
all kinds of different microphones and people all the time all the time when they go in and they

340
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:04,680
sit down they talk directly into the microphone well of course it's this big phallic thing that's

341
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:11,080
staring you're right in the face you know you don't approach those things at a 45 degree angle

342
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:18,760
ever but once we're using the right now or the electric voice something 20 looks like a giant

343
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:25,400
trojan kind of or something you probably know what I'm talking about yeah I do well hold on a

344
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:30,600
second that's not entirely true because and this is just geeky for for people who are interested

345
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:35,640
but the the shoe or microphone that you that you speak of is pretty much the same model as the

346
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:43,000
high PR 40 that I'm using originally it was developed for a to record drum kicks the the

347
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,680
kick drum the bass drum so they put it into that hole that you see often in or on the other side

348
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:54,520
of course but they would put it into the into the bass drum so it gets the actual force of the drum

349
00:28:54,520 --> 00:29:00,600
the wind straight into it so you know it wasn't even developed for for use in for voice it was

350
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:06,840
did not have to for drum kicks the 45 degree angle to your face if you talk into the mic not only

351
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:15,080
are you gonna pop it unless you got this thing perfect that's it you're also gonna get the sound

352
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:21,320
of you breathing into it yeah exactly I like that you gotta understand one thing and I do appreciate

353
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:27,560
what you're saying but my show has a sound and I think if you go back to 395 and listen you'll

354
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:33,080
understand that I take my sound very seriously I like it I like being able to I like being able to

355
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:39,320
hear myself breathe I like a little bit of a little bit of a reverb on it I like a lot of compression

356
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,280
I like the music to be compressed it's my art you know it's almost like saying to the Rolling Stone

357
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:49,320
you know hey your guitar is distorting hey Jimmy Hendrix man can you hear that the guitars distorting

358
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,640
turn it down don't turn it past eleven something that I didn't leave on the last message that I'll

359
00:29:53,640 --> 00:30:00,920
leave on this one just been popping on and off probably about three or four times first show

360
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:09,000
for about the last ten or fifteen shows I've noticed I'll be driving along I'm feeding my NB3

361
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,280
player through my car stereo and I'll get a pop just coming out of nowhere so you're either pop in the

362
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:23,080
mic or you're over modulating cash last or one of the other so dude for the other the

363
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:34,040
content oh okay right it's about the content it's my sound man I like it that way I want you

364
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:41,880
to hear the the flem in my throat if at all possible we discussed during a Trinity segment

365
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:49,720
where was that there was three hundred seven maybe I think about this new hydrogen power

366
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,200
that this guy developed and he's making hummers for the US government that run on water

367
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:00,600
or it's like hydrogen and so the the person the only person I know who really knows about this

368
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:06,440
stuff and his up on it is Ray Lane one of our board members and investors from

369
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,920
Clienter Perkins because they do a lot with this green tech fund they have like 200 million

370
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:16,040
dollars they're investing an alternative energy and fuels and research and all kinds of stuff and

371
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,480
so I sent him that and he said yeah well first of all he says that he had like he really

372
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,600
laughed about Patricia talking about you know the conversation she had with him where he was

373
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:30,520
offhandedly talking about the forty million dollar house he almost bought and of course he'd already

374
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,280
seen the YouTube video and I did but I think I put a link to that in the show notes he said

375
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:41,240
he looked into it and let me just grab a couple pieces from his response here

376
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,120
the first question from the water fuel video is can you get more energy from hydrogen enhanced

377
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:53,560
gasoline combustion then it took to make it and I guess that is really what it comes down to the

378
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:59,240
answer is a very cautious yes what's very poorly understood is the characterization of that

379
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,200
enhancement effect the thinking is that the combustion of a relatively much larger mass of fuel

380
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,760
in a process that is quite inefficient to begin with can have big swings and efficiency from

381
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:17,640
small changes in combustion okay so the one-out bought a number of onboard H2 generation systems

382
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:24,680
advertised around the web installed them and put the results on the dyno what's the dyno no

383
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:29,640
statistically significant results however the characterization of the impact of hydrogen addition

384
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:35,080
to natural gas is very complete and there is a threshold is 10% for an observable effect

385
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,760
so I guess what what he's saying here is that maybe there's even more yeah the carrot is that

386
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:46,280
using primary ice energy man there's too many acronyms here ray ice energy to make sufficient

387
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:52,680
hydrogen might not have a net positive impact on power output so it actually takes more energy

388
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,800
and people said this about biodiesel in the beginning as well but it's not entirely true at least

389
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:04,200
biofuel maybe with ethanol but not biodiesel but when it comes to the hydrogen stuff it apparently

390
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:11,640
takes more energy to actually create it than it delivers however using waste energy in the exhaust

391
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:17,960
heat and pressure might very well tip the balance and of course it also the result of a hydrogen

392
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:24,040
hybrid engine is water so you can reuse that but the jury still seems to be a little bit out

393
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:32,440
lots of comments still about episode number 400 that we had recently and here's an interesting

394
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:40,280
feedback about a future milestone what about um this is Buck Thompson a listener i don't have a podcast

395
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:47,160
at least not yet um so i'm just listening here to uh to the charlie number 400

396
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,120
congrats on that milestone but i was thinking it was like you know what's the next milestone

397
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:59,400
and it like it hit me like a ton of bricks i'm driving from work i'm like holy shit it's 420

398
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:07,640
and like i gotta do something i gotta i gotta start a podcast or i gotta i gotta do something this is like

399
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:15,480
monumental jeez so i decided to share uh my excitement unfortunately that's all i have to share right now

400
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:22,520
like hard and uh i can't do much about it but uh i don't know maybe you'll hear from me um but that's

401
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:29,480
it no plugs uh love the show keep going um i'm having a lot of fun listening to it thanks right

402
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:35,800
on man and uh 420's back at you make sure you get all your stuff in for episode 420 get your

403
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:42,040
light clicks get your pod save songs that you think are relative send them on in lots of people

404
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,360
suggested stuff i should do for tomorrow's show which actually i was planning to be the show while

405
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:52,840
i was in the air i wanted 404 to be very simple the podcast you requested is no longer a bit

406
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:09,000
it's always difficult to see a loved one struggle with cancer and there are many

407
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,200
worthy organizations working to find a cure there is another approach prevention

408
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:22,120
located in the San Francisco Bay area the breast cancer fund submission is to identify and eliminate

409
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:29,080
the environmental causes of the disease for example some plastic water bottles contain chemicals

410
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:35,080
linked to breast cancer the breast cancer fund is working to eliminate these and other dangerous

411
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:41,720
chemicals from consumer products i'm inviting you to participate in the fourth annual bike

412
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:47,160
against the odds a fundraising ride for the breast cancer fund on Sunday September 10

413
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:54,920
you can either ride or sponsor a cyclist or team there are five beautiful roots winding

414
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:00,600
through the picture-esque espae hills ranging from 12 miles to a challenging full century

415
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,440
the local yellow jacket cycling club members will keep the bike riders safe and on track

416
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:12,200
at the finish line a delicious organic lunch live music and an expo await you

417
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:22,120
for donations or sign-ups please go to www breast cancerfund.org spelled f-u-n-d and click on the

418
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:28,120
bike against the odds link you'll be glad you did thanks and tailwinds to all the cyclists out there

419
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,800
in the background you've been listening to scanlin on the pod safe music network

420
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,400
good initiative man anything i can do to help so let me know

421

from from Germany says hey Adam think you already know this maybe you don't care Angela Merkel

427
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:27,720
the German federal chancellor which is comparable to a prime minister is just started a weekly video

428
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,920
podcast and it gives me the feed christian thank you very much i've said i'm subscribed to that

429
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:38,040
and i'll put a link into the show notes it's always good i love seeing politicians getting into

430
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,480
podcasting and using new media and i love even more if they keep it up very few do you know usually

431
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,600
it's like maybe one or maybe even a second episode and that's it you know almost second what's

432
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:57,240
flashing here for some reason oh what is this still still so getting used to some of the

433
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,040
quirks of windows oh man this is sheba is not very nice when you run on a battery power though

434
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:08,680
it kind of tells you and then closes down within seconds okay just a couple more g-mails here

435
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,920
Adam Doug from Doug and Boulder oh Doug and Boulder right had a quick request can we stop using

436
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,960
the term wife beater to refer to tank top undershirts hoping not being too thin skinned here but

437
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,480
I gotta tell you every time i hear you or someone else use that term well it makes me cringe

438
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,480
it has a real negative connotation for me kind of like child pornography whoa dude i mean

439
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,680
no it's a wife beater it's just a figure of speech come on it'll be so sensitive

440
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:43,160
okay and thanks so much to everybody who sent me invites to rightly i'm now using it man

441
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:48,920
is that stuff amazing you really is fantastic this is the online word processor so you can

442
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:54,040
create an open and and edit Microsoft Word documents you can collaborate with people on documents

443
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,440
you can actually use it as a chat system it's it's really it's a very smart thing

444
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,120
and i discovered that there's another feature if you receive an email and of course i'm sure this

445
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,280
is all going to be tied together you know soon when there's an h with there's a Microsoft Word

446
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,680
