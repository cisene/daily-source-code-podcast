00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Good morning from Amsterdam.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Today is July 3rd, 2006, and I have sad news to report.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yesterday my mom, Valerie Gail Clark, passed away at age 67.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I spent the last hours notifying family and friends.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A task I expected to be actually a sorrowful one.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But was astounded by the wonderful response we received.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Everyone has so many happy and loving memories over.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
As listeners of the Daily Source Code, you've been an integral part of this journey,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
which started almost two years ago with a discovery of our illness.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
With mom's permission, of course, have been able to keep our extended family

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
of Charlie listeners updated on her progress.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And throughout this time, your emails and outpouring of love

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
have been so helpful to her, to my sisters and to myself.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So I also want to share this moment of closure with you.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
In her last days in the physical world, she was with her three children

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and her life partner. She had a very peaceful passing

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
without pain and filled with love, humor, and happy memories.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And my mom was very outspoken and determined as all who know her will confirm.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And she insisted that her favorite radio station was on in her final hours.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And packages in that request was her private message to me,

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
which I want to share with you.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You see in our last talk together, mom told me that I was always her favorite son,

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
which she said often and is great because I'm her only son.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And then she said she loved me forever and ever.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And she repeated that several times.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Now listen to the lyrics of the song that was playing during her passing.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The moment I wake up,

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
before I put on my makeup,

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I say a little prayer for you.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Though I go in my hand now,

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And one dream was just too well now,

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I say a little prayer for you.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But my love forever,

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
you stay in my heart,

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and I will love you forever,

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and never,

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
we never will hold on,

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I will love you together,

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
that's how it must be,

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
to live away,

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and I'll be with only,

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
in heartbreak for you.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll run for the rest here,

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
or running on a thing that looks fine.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I say a little prayer for you.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And we're got just take time,

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and I'll through them,

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
but come and feel right now.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I say a little prayer for you.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
My love forever,

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
you stay in my heart,

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and I will love you forever,

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and never,

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
we never will hold on,

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I will love you together,

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,500
Together, let's go, it must be the little wind

63
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,000
That you would only mean heartbreak for me

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Whatever, whatever, you say in the heart

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And I will love you forever

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And ever, we never know what part of how

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
How are you together together?

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's go, it must be the little wind

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That you would only mean heartbreak for me

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But don't let me mean it

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Don't be embarrassed and no one's body

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Please love me too

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm in love with you

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And some afraid

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Say you love me too

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And be with me once again

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's all my friends

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You know every day I say a little forever

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I say it, I say it a little forever

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You know if mom were here today

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
She'd be very concerned about that song

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Not being pod save

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I can just hear her warning me of impending peril of breaking the law

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Like I've heard her do to me so many times in the past two years

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So I also want a pod save song to remain in our hearts

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And we think of this beautiful woman

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Full of grit, courage and passion

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And I think we all know someone just like her

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I've been down

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I've been out

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And I feel like my lives came in

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And I can't seem to find

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
My lives are bound

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And I'm lost my direction again

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But now I'm still lonely at the end of the day

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I know that my son is phone call the way

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Because it's here

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You're all the way

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's my weary soul

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
When it's been steeped

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And it's here

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Mother, take my broken heart

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And you'll save me

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
When I'll strip away

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Nothing more can I say

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Then I love you

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You're all the way

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Here I go

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Here I go

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I end the making

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Sound that can walk away

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But I know that I can take

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Because you're sharing me all the way

114
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm feeling lost in the dead of the night

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's telling me to hang on

116
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Don't give up the fight

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Because it's here

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Mother

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's my weary soul

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
When it's been steeped

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And it's here

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Mother, take my broken heart

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And you'll save me

124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
When I'll strip away

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Nothing more can I say

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Then I love you

127
00:08:46,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Mother, take my broken heart

128
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And you'll save me

129
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm feeling lost in the dead of the night

130
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's telling me to hang on

131
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Don't give up the fight

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Because you're sharing me all the way

133
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm feeling lost in the dead of the night

134
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's telling me to hang on

135
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Don't give up the fight

136
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We move mother, we smile, we smile, and it's been a lie

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:52,000
We move mother, takes my mind, your safe care

138
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We move mother, we smile, we smile, and it's been a lie

139
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:31,000
We move mother, we smile, we smile, and it's been a lie

140
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Butterflies are free, I love you, Mommy
