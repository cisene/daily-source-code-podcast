00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 417.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Done the next generation radio content in my ears.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, hey everybody, how you doing?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It is Saturday.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Welcome to Curry Cottage with a little update on the podcast.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We're going to take a nice and easy today.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Today is Saturday.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's the 8th of July, 2006.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We're a couple days post launch and post send off.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And I really wanted to give you guys an update of what's going on.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Where everybody's at, what's been happening, how I'm doing, how you doing.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So, I found some instrumental music actually that I figured.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'll play some pod save tunes later on with vocals.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let me just tell you who this is before I forget.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This is a dark horse summer dreaming from the Podsick Music Network.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So let me rewind you if you don't mind.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
By the way, I've got my sensei here and I've got everything else that I like having

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
to be in a nice chill mood.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Stake you back to Wednesday.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
There you go.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Wednesday was back at the cottage, flew back with easy jet actually.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Since the aircraft was back in at Ferrox.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'd sent a foolishly sent Captain Dan back.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Of course, he did have to do something else.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Some other stuff.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
When I arrived on Sunday.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So anyway, so I went back Wednesday.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I was way too tired to do a show.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It was so much going on because of course the plan was to launch pod show

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
plus on July 4th for your full-blown media independence.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And this was all coinciding at the same time with

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Mom's passing the private ceremony for the family.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And of course, by her request the 50s rock and roll party that I was that I'd organized for her.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And so I was just I was waxed man.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Wednesday evening the wind commander who really, he pulled a whole bunch of strings.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He actually had someone drop them off in their own plane at Ferrox.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Because I really, you know, first of all, I like having a safety pilot.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Certainly when my mind is on a whole bunch of things.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And definitely if I've got my family with me.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So he was really, really nice.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And he hopped out, jumped in with me, and we took off for Rotterdam.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Which was actually nice flight.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Christina's still a little bit nervous about flying.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Although she's getting much, much better.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And we're paying a lot of attention to it.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You know, making sure that the ride is as smooth as possible.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Requesting different altitudes if it gets too bumpy.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You know, she watches so much.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So many different horror movies.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Her idea of, you know, airplane disaster is, you know,

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh, it's, it's a, it's a thunderstorm.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We're being struck by lightning.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You know, the stuff that rarely ever happens.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If at all, it's always some other reason.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Um, so he stated to the brand new Western hotel in Rotterdam,

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
which is nice.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We had two rooms.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And it was, uh, it was just nice to kind of relax.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We watched the game, uh, which of course was, um,

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
a France against Portugal.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Hello.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Is someone coming in?

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I thought Patricia was coming in.

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's just the door.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Don't go away.

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let me go close.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Come on.

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
All right.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
There you go.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Um.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So we watched the game, which, you know, kind of had half my eye on.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Ron, by this time, had arrived in London because we were a big meeting on Monday.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Um, for Pod Show UK.

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And of course, at the same time, uh, we're desperately trying to unleash Pod Show

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Plus and the podcast delivery network.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And man, it wasn't an incredible time.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I was up until three, uh, that evening or Thursday morning, um, on the phone with San Francisco

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and Ron was in London and I was in Rotterdam.

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And what a pleasure to work with this team that we have at Pod Show.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You know, we, we obviously, the, the launch was delayed due to, um, that was due to one

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
bug.

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
One significant bug that was so significant, of course, was as small as an Ampherson.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And what, what really happens is, you know, when you have all these moving pieces coming together,

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and if you look at the new Pod Show.com and you see what we've built, I think you'll understand

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
that there are a lot of moving pieces.

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And one little anomaly in, uh, in fact, in the data can actually make a huge difference.

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And yeah, can, uh, can screw up a lot of stuff.

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Um, and so we just, because, you know, particularly with the data we use, which is, you know,

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
people's people's data, making stuff, changing stuff.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Uh, we had hundreds of data testers in there, but you make a new episode, your feed changes.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And then, you know, it's, if you can't replicate a problem consistently, then it becomes much harder

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
to track down.

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And at a certain point, everyone's tired and then you just have to kind of like regroup and sit down

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and, and we beat it all the way down and then we said, okay, then we'll launch tomorrow then.

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And of course, that was Thursday.

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Uh, at this time it already was Thursday, but it would be several hours later, San Francisco

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
time.

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So, I decided to, uh, not think I turned off the phone, just completely shut off everything

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and concentrated on the day itself, which was fantastic.

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We had a very private ceremony, uh, from my mom.

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's just, uh, my sister Tiffany Willow, Bob.

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It was a keto and, uh, it's my sister's friend.

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Um, she'll hate it if I say boy friend.

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
A little bit more than that.

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Uh, and out of San Dro, uh, Willow's husband came over from Italy and Patricia myself and Christina.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And it was, it was beautiful.

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Um, you know, exactly the way my mom wanted it.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You know, not a whole bunch of people just us sitting around, um, listening to Vivaldi

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and then the last song that was played.

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Ah, so typical Elvis Presley's are you alone some tonight, but then in the version where it

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
cracks up laughing and starts singing the wrong lyrics.

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So, it's really a fantastic choice because you can laugh and cry at the same time.

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It really, it worked very well.

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Uh, then we all went back to freshen up and get ready for the 50s rock and roll party,

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
which was held at this place called Catties Diner, um, above Amsterdam, actually, or

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
just on the outskirts of Amsterdam.

126
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And, you know, my mom was so right.

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What a fantastic idea.

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You know, no uncomfortable speeches, you know, really fun music, a great atmosphere, food,

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
drink and, you know, everyone kind of loosens up and then, you know, instead of people standing

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
up and giving speeches, we all could have personal share personal stories about, uh, about my mom

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and how she, uh, affected us or touched our lives or, you know, just talked about how she was a person.

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And it really was a very, I mean, I would recommend, it doesn't have to be the 50s theme,

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
but I would really recommend that as a, depending on your faith, of course, and your beliefs as a

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
great way of healing and kind of transitioning into what is the unavoidable, you know,

135
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
void that, that opens up.

136
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You know, even during the party, the party for my mom and thinking, I should ask my mom,

137
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
she'd know that and I'm like, oh, no, wait a minute.

138
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll twist this as that.

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
As by the way, it's for, uh, EL84 from the Pod Sabin music network with forever my love.

140
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Man, without instrumental categories, outrageous, big.

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So after all that was done and everyone had said goodbye, um, and I will be posting pictures, um,

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
at curry.com, and I'll probably put something somewhere in the show notes from the comments section,

143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
maybe even the blog section of dailysourcecode.com, which is still the same address,

144
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
but you'll see it's now points to the dailysourcecode.com page on the Pod Sabin music,

145
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
on the, the Pod show plot, so it's my own page.

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So, um, you know, why, why we play a full song with vocals, and then we're

147
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
talking about the release.

148
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I played these guys before, where they're Wednesday's song, it's a slack stream.

149
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Sun again, we'll shine.

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And they can't be music, right?

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It makes you want to smile.

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
In fact, I am smiling.

153
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We're slowly lost in weight, and you'll ignore talking straight.

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Don't you know where Sun's going to shine again?

155
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We're slowly lost in weight, and you'll ignore talking straight.

156
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Don't you know where Sun's going to shine again?

157
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
When you look is running out, and your mind is full of doubt.

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Don't you know where everything will work out, just fine.

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
We're slowly getting shine.

160
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But for who I'm showing up, my baby, the shine.

161
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And all those distinctions, all closer that they seem, all my baby.

162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The shine.

163
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
When the world is just a stage, and we're all players in the play.

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
When you are to be honest, they may be waiting.

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And I promise we all met about living life, but haven't found.

166
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
When the world's been rushing me, oh, about this time.

167
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
We're slowly getting shine.

168
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I swear to you in the time, oh, my baby, the shine.

169
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And all those distinctions, all closer that they seem, all my baby.

170
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The shine.

171
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
When the world's been rushing me, oh, about this time.

172
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And all those distinctions, all closer that they seem, all my baby.

173
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The shine.

174
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
When the world's been rushing me, oh, about this time.

175
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We're slowly getting shine.

176
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And all those distinctions, all closer that they seem, all my baby.

177
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The shine.

178
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:10,000
When the world's been rushing me, oh, about this time.

179
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The slack street.

180
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's on again, well, shine.

181
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And you know it.

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Shine it again today.

183
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And the affluent suburb of Surrey.

184
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Known as Kielfitt.

185
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Okay.

186
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So you can hear the fan in the background, by the way.

187
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's not as hot as it was.

188
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
We're kind of past the heat wave, but it's still up there.

189
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And of course, my room with all the equipment captures all the heat and just kind of holds it all day long.

190
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So Friday morning, we woke up on time, kind of in a days, obviously, and got dressed,

191
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
checked out the hotel, went off to the airport.

192
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The wing commander was, well, now, I need another 50 hour inspection.

193
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Which show, wing commander William does for me and Antwerp.

194
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So that was pretty convenient, because he just fly over and then he'd fly the aircraft back.

195
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
He'd get it fixed.

196
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And then sometime next weekend, whenever he'll come, they'll come over.

197
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
He'll bring it back and then I'll bring it back and then I'll fly back home and then it's done.

198
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's a little bit of logistics, but at the end of the day, lots of good flying when we go through these exercises.

199
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And it's maintained by someone I trust implicitly, which is probably the most important part,

200
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
and who trained me how to fly.

201
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The helicopter, as well as fixed wing.

202
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So he was going to show up at 11.

203
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
We were going to do wheels up at 11, which between William and I mean,

204
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
see at 5, 2, 11, and I'll have the aircraft pre-flighted checked ready to go, loaded, etc.

205
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I kind of love this aircraft so much, the Delta Sierra.

206
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I haven't done the thing I've talked about it in a while, but it's a Session 182,

207
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
which is really, if you just look at it, I'd say, oh, it's one of those kind of look,

208
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
this sporty airplanes, but people who know, it's much bigger than a 172,

209
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and really can take a full set of luggage, even with two women in the family here.

210
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
We were able to get all the luggage in, no problem, it's nice and comfortable,

211
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
a full-auto pilot, an IFR, you can fly in any conditions, and it's very fast for a

212
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
certainly for a single-engine aircraft.

213
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So I went out, unlocked the plane, it was at the Rotterdam Jet Center, I got all the luggage in.

214
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And there's something you do, by the way, that is really 100% drilled into me for safety.

215
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Whenever you have the keys to an aircraft near the aircraft, you always put them up on the dashboard,

216
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
so that particularly with the piston engine aircraft, or really only with the piston engine aircraft, I guess,

217
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,000
because even though the master switch isn't on, if the key is in the ignition, it's just like a car.

218
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
If the key is in the ignition, or even a short without the key being in the ignition quite honestly,

219
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
but it will happen with the key in there, if it's even clicked one little notch to the right,

220
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
if someone were to touch the prop and turn it, or maybe pushing back the aircraft, it could actually fire up and start,

221
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and that could have disastrous results.

222
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So it's really amongst engineers, predominantly, that this has been drilled into me,

223
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
so that, of course, is from William, is whenever you got the keys, put them on the dashboard,

224
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
so everyone around that aircraft knows, it can't just fire up by accident.

225
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's a safety thing, so it's drilled into me.

226
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So I pre-flighted everything, actually added two courts of oil.

227
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,000
This was the last time around the mineral oil, it's now getting its whole new lubrication system, whatever that's for another day.

228
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And William showed up, and so we all hop into the aircraft, and this is, you know, it's the Rotterdam Jet Center,

229
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
which is really where all huge private jets come in, so we're kind of small compared to all the other guys,

230
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
but it is, you know, it's, they've got the luxury lounge and everything, and you pay for it,

231
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
but it, it does make you feel pretty good and important, you know, you walk right out to the airplane,

232
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and people accompany you and carry your bags and help you win, and do anything you need.

233
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
They remove your chocks and, you know, the stuff that the two blocks of wood that,

234
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
keep your aircraft from rolling, it's a full service outfit.

235
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And I reach for the keys, and they're not there, and I say to William,

236
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
it's okay, very funny, you know, he'll do this, he'll do all kinds of stuff like this.

237
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's a part of the ongoing education, you know, in, like in the middle of the flight, he'll

238
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
secretly turn off the autopilot and then see how I respond, and it's all basically responding to situations, etc.

239
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So it's a very funny William give me the keys, you know, usually don't last more than 30 seconds,

240
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
these practical jokes, because I don't have him, and I knew he didn't have him.

241
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Well, let me tell you, in short, the keys that I know where I always put them,

242
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
we're gone, and, and we search for an hour and a half, including unloading the entire aircraft,

243
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
we went through trash cans, put hands and toilet bowls.

244
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I mean, everything we could do to find these keys, and they were unfindable.

245
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And let me tell you, when you've got that whole legs, luxury set up and everything,

246
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
it's like standing at the side of the road with your Ferrari, because you ran out of gas.

247
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I mean, it's really stupid and embarrassing.

248
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And well, luckily, William knew how to get a spare key up to the airport,

249
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
so we finally got back, and then when I got back, I was like, okay,

250
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm going to have a cup of tea and jump right into it.

251
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I know Ron was already doing stuff, and he was online.

252
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And San Francisco was up and about as if some of them had not even slept, I believe.

253
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The site was live at this point, and of course,

254
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
has all kinds of stuff being worked out, all kinds of little things,

255
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
and some medium things, and a couple of big things, one of which is that,

256
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,000
you know, I popped up in my browser only to see that I was evil.

257
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And that I was a hijacker, and stealing feeds, and being a bad dude.

258
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And there's a couple of ways I could have gone at that point,

259
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
but I definitely looked towards the heavens and said, okay, mom,

260
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
give me some fucking strength now, because now we're in for a ride.

261
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And you know what, I think, well, actually what I want to do is,

262
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
and I desperately want to do a dev cast with a couple,

263
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
like a Skype with a couple of folks from Pod Show HQ,

264
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
who've been working so hard just to, even while they continue to fix stuff,

265
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
just to talk to him, but everyone was so, so slammed,

266
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
but that's what we'll get into all the real nitty gritty stuff.

267
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
But for now, I do want to explain to you just a little bit about what happened,

268
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
what the perception was, and what the reality was.

269
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And for 10 foils, 10 foils had moments, 10 foils, 10 foils, 10 foils, 10 foils had moments.

270
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And now it's time for the 10 foils have moment.

271
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The Jeff Smith, everybody.

272
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Thank you very much, buddy.

273
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Jeff Smith, the Jeff Smith.com G-E-O-F-F for the Jeff.

274
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's a 10 foils have moment, that's right.

275
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So, let me just explain what the word out there on the internet was,

276
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and then what really happened, and how we addressed it, and what the real issues were.

277
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So, as you know, Pod Castile is a part of the Pod Show family,

278
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
and IndiePotter.org, and so these are huge directories.

279
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And we obviously depopulate the Pod Show plus experience,

280
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
so people can find stuff where we have, I think, a very good search,

281
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
which we're still working on.

282
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's not quite there yet, but it's getting very close.

283
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
All kinds of ways to integrate within the system.

284
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
We pull all of the information in basically from the original RSS feed,

285
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
the podcast feed, if you will.

286
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And just like any other, anyone else who wants to do anything with that information,

287
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
you basically have to have a local copy because the reliability of external feeds

288
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
is just not that high.

289
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And so when we have the information, we want to hold on to that.

290
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
For at least 15 minutes or until it's requested again,

291
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
so that we can do all kinds of stuff like it, like give you simple ways to add it to channels,

292
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
to share it with people, to feed back information,

293
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
so there has to be some kind of consistency.

294
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So we basically cash that, no different from what iTunes does.

295
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Now, what we actually went a couple of steps,

296
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
well, let me see, let me back up a second.

297
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
No, no, I have to go all the way through.

298
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So if you were to look for any show,

299
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
and it doesn't necessarily have to be a Pod Show podcast,

300
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
remember, this site is built for audience members and for listeners.

301
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You go searching for the show,

302
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and then you'll find a couple different ways to play the show.

303
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You can click play it, which will fire up our,

304
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
our dashboard, our player.

305
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm more about that later on,

306
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
which basically gives you a way to play an episode,

307
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
but also look at everything else in the feed,

308
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
or if it's a part of a channel,

309
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
you can look at what's coming up next,

310
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and you can jump ahead to stuff.

311
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So there's lots of things going on in there,

312
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
but something that I actually like very much

313
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
is we're also transcoding the feed,

314
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
excuse me, since say this, and say a moment,

315
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
brought you all about Apple.podshow.com,

316
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
a new site I saw pop up.

317
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
We give you a way to play it in Windows Media Player,

318
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
which actually works very well.

319
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm amazed, also a real player or Winamp,

320
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
and then we have an XML button,

321
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
which means, hey, here's the raw data,

322
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
you can put this into any kind of aggregator or player

323
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
that you want to.

324
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
So those four buttons, if you will,

325
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
or five, actually I think iTunes is there as well.

326
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So those five buttons are all lined up next to each other,

327
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
and then underneath it there's a play button

328
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
for to play it in our dashboard.

329
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And all of those, of course,

330
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
work on this internal copy that we have

331
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
the most recent copy of the show,

332
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
which is the only way we can reliably produce

333
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
a good experience for someone who just wants to listen to the show.

334
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's that simple.

335
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And what of course should have happened

336
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
is the link underneath the orange on white XML button,

337
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
which by me is still the standard RSS button.

338
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I know we have this kind of like that Firefox logo

339
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
thingy that now it means RSS,

340
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
but I'm still kind of old school when it comes to that.

341
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And so that of course should be directly linked to the original,

342
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
which contains all the original information,

343
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
no added bits from us, the original copyrights, et cetera.

344
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But because we have these internal feeds,

345
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
and this is completely a mistake on our part.

346
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's not a bug.

347
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
This is funny because people were saying,

348
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
oh, well, it can't be a bug.

349
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Well, no, wasn't a bug.

350
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It was a dumb mistake, you know, just,

351
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
it slipped through.

352
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So instead of linking to the external feed,

353
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
it linked to the internal feed.

354
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
But what was interesting is that a number of people

355
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
who are in the podcast community immediately jumped

356
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
on this and said, you know, your thieves, your stealing,

357
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
you're taking our feed and, and stripping out copyright.

358
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Well, no, I mean, we're not stripping out copyright.

359
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It was just an internal feed.

360
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That's why it's at NA.

361
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It's just like a zero under the copyright link

362
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
in our internal feed.

363
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It has different information.

364
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's not your original feed, which, yeah, I mean,

365
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
if we're going to republish that as your feed,

366
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
that would be completely wrong.

367
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And by the way, we've also gone back

368
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
and fixed the Windows media, the real player,

369
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
and the iTunes as well as the, the Winamp feed.

370
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So they reflect all the original information.

371
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It was just, as I said, on my web blog,

372
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
it was just a mistake, you know,

373
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
it, it, QA said, hey, it all works.

374
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Well, of course, but, you know, you had to check

375
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
down a couple bits lower.

376
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And again, with all the moving pieces, it slipped through.

377
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Now, no, and now, there are only a few people.

378
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It was nice to see you said, hey, you know,

379
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
maybe this is just an honest mistake.

380
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And that's really where, you know,

381
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
you see what people are really made of

382
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
when they come out and say,

383
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
you know, this is not unintentional.

384
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You know, curries way too smart for this.

385
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You know, this is clearly, since they couldn't steal

386
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
our content with contracts, now they're doing it

387
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
through our feeds.

388
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And just all these horrible, horrible things that were being said,

389
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
when all that it took was, well,

390
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
it actually was even more work than I expected it to be.

391
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Because this code hits five different places.

392
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And you've got to be careful when you're changing things

393
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
and alive and, well, we have, of course,

394
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
we have a development and data environments.

395
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
But when you push something through,

396
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
you just got to make sure it all works properly.

397
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And so it was a relatively simple change

398
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
to just link back to the original feed.

399
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And with that, it all kind of went away.

400
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
But boy, did I learn something about a few people?

401
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Even people who I know have professionally released web services.

402
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
You know, this is not just a product that we put in a box.

403
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You know, and there's a whole different level of testing

404
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
that goes on with a product that gets put in a box

405
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
and shipped out or downloaded and run.

406
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I mean, this is something that is continuously morphing.

407
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
The data is the data that the users and, in this case,

408
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
audience members and podcasters have flowing

409
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
through the veins of the system.

410
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So there's a lot of variables that you can hit.

411
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
A lot of people do some incredibly interesting things,

412
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
which guess what?

413
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
They don't always conform to what technologists and engineers expect.

414
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And so we're learning to come closer together.

415
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And that's working quite well.

416
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But for these people who know how, if you really look at it,

417
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
you can see, oh wait a minute, yeah, I see what happened.

418
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
These guys put all these internal feeds into these other player options.

419
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And then they just put the external feed underneath the XML button,

420
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
which if anyone had just said, hey, you should just link to our,

421
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
to the original feed, and it would have been okay.

422
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You know, but all the screaming and yelling,

423
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
which actually worked quite in our favor,

424
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
because, and some people even,

425
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
weren't even accusing me of this being the plan,

426
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
like trying cause controversy immediately.

427
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So we were like, number two on Technoradi,

428
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
which is amazing.

429
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
And of course, because of all that, this unleash,

430
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
although I certainly was talking it up on the Charlie,

431
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
you know, there was no press release that went out.

432
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
This was just to go live and get it going,

433
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
but there were so many people in the system at this time,

434
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
several hundred that it became a much bigger deal.

435
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And, you know, we're our data center as all modularly built.

436
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So, you know, you find out pretty quickly how many simultaneous users

437
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
you can handle on one box.

438
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And so, man, we brought on six extra boxes.

439
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So that was really good.

440
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And now that things have stabilized, you know,

441
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
some things have been temporarily shut off or don't work,

442
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
but in general, everything is there.

443
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And I'm using it and loving it,

444
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
because we built this as audience members.

445
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You know, this is how Andrew Grumman and I worked

446
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
in the early days when he was doing lemon.

447
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And with many, many different teams, you know,

448
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
really from an audience perspective, and hey, you know,

449
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
yeah, let's look at the image instead of the text links.

450
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And why don't we look at things horizontally instead of vertically.

451
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And I'm using it, and I'm really, really enjoying it.

452
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And I'm liking all the, I'm not a my space guy

453
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
or a real social network person.

454
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Yeah, and a couple of porn sites, but, you know.

455
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
But I'm seeing a lot of value in it.

456
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I really am.

457
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And I encourage you to go to dailysourcecode.com.

458
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And leave a comment.

459
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You know, you can dig the show.

460
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
You can create a channel.

461
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
You can interact with other listeners to the Charlie.

462
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And sign up and let's have some fun.

463
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And come up with ideas.

464
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Will you please?

465
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Because this is just the beginning.

466
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
This is just the baseline barrier to entry.

467
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
There's so many incredible things.

468
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Just even playing around with the system.

469
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Come up with great ideas.

470
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You know.

471
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Uh, this is just a shit load.

472
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
A lot of stuff.

473
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Um, so, uh, let's see.

474
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Yeah, that went until about two o'clock this morning.

475
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And, uh, then I went to bed.

476
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And this morning I got up.

477
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And I could really see that everything was stable.

478
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And, uh, and now we can really start moving forward.

479
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Uh, creating, uh, and, you know, just an example.

480
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
The, the player that you're seeing.

481
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Now we call it the bubble player.

482
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Uh, it is not what we intended to release with.

483
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Or unleash with.

484
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
It's, uh, it's really just, uh, almost an engineering technical design.

485
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You know.

486
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
So there's, there's a new player, which will be coming in the next couple of days.

487
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Um, you already see some of the functionality in there.

488
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You know, if you're listening to a show that you just find somewhere within the network,

489
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
you can add it to your channels really easily right from the player.

490
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
You can, uh, fire up entire channels from the player.

491
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It really, it becomes, uh, an interface you can use with just the,

492
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
the, the, the play out, uh, bits, uh, that you, uh, that you, uh, that you would want.

493
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
But you can also get the functionality without going to the larger site itself,

494
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
or going into your account.

495
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Uh, good.

496
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So there you have it.

497
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Uh, we're cruising along.

498
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Lots of stuff to, lots of stuff to deal with and lots of stuff to work on.

499
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And I, once again, I want to thank everybody at, uh, at Pod Show for just a bang-up job.

500
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And for working so hard through your holiday weekend, uh, you know,

501
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
and people jump in to help out.

502
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And of course, so congratulations to Richard Brueher,

503
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and, uh, and his lovely wife, Ali, um, who on the 4th of July, um,

504
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
just near the very end there on the day of our, the official day of our unleashed,

505
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
uh, unhead, uh, an unleashed of their cell, their own.

506
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Uh, Addison Brueher, hey, is now welcome, uh, to the family, a beautiful baby girl,

507
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
six pounds, two ounces, I think, uh,

508
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
guess everyone's back home already, and, uh,

509
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
oh, what's this?

510
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I got, is that an email for Patricia?

511
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
My wife is emailing me. It's driving me nuts.

512
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
From downstairs. She's probably emailing me houses.

513
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Um, yeah, everybody thanks, and particularly thank you for being so patient.

514
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I know we had a lot of hiccups with, uh, with registration emails and, and all kinds of stuff.

515
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Um, in general, everyone was just really irritated,

516
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
but extremely nice about it and understanding, and, uh,

517
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
and I think that we're paying it off now that you're able to get in.

518
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Okay, let's play another song, and, uh,

519
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
then we'll close down this up there.

520
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Do you believe me when I say I'm sorry?

521
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
The lives are out this way, it's not the way that I wanted it to be.

522
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Do you believe me when I say it might be when you turn away?

523
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Maybe you mean everything to me, everything to me.

524
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Open your mind and your heart.

525
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
To be able to give you a brand new start.

526
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
We can grow all the pain away.

527
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
We can love without being afraid.

528
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Yeah.

529
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Do you believe me when I say I'm sorry?

530
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,000
The lives are out this way, it's not the way that I wanted it to be.

531
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Do you believe me when I say it might be when you turn away?

532
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Maybe you mean everything to me, everything to me, everything to me.

533
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Go ahead and get free, because I don't sometimes do you will believe?

534
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Do you believe me when I say I'm sorry?

535
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:34,000
The lives are out this way, it's not the way that I wanted it to be.

536
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Do you believe me when I say I'm sorry?

537
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
The lives are out this way, it's not the way that I wanted it to be.

538
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Do you believe me when I say it might be when you turn away?

539
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Maybe you mean everything to me, everything to me.

540
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Do you believe me when I say I'm sorry?

541
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
The lives are out this way, it's not the way that I wanted it to be.

542
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Do you believe me when I say it might be when you turn away?

543
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Maybe you mean everything to me, everything to me, everything to me.

544
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Broken Jair from Kansas and listed on the Podsame Music Network.

545
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
You'll find links and show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

546
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
You probably noticed depending on how you're listening to the show that I still have the American flag butterfly in my podcast picture.

547
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I'm going to leave that up for a couple more days.

548
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You know by now that my mom was nuts about butterflies.

549
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Of course, everybody, as I told you, took a butterfly out of her box and wore it during the party,

550
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
also during the cremation, of course.

551
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,000
My mom was nuts about butterflies and it's almost like magical.

552
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
You see her pass away in the time where butterflies are just coming to life.

553
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
They only live for a week or two weeks and they're all over the place.

554
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Whenever I see a butterfly, it's really easy and nice and comforting for me to think about my mom.

555
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And for those of you who knew her and those of you who know her or knew her,

556
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
by Cariously through the source code, I'd like you to think about that as well.

557
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Next time you see a butterfly, think about my mom.

558
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Okay, everybody.

559
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
There might be an update tomorrow.

560
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Lots of stuff happening in London this week.

561
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
So I hope to bring you up to speed on that.

562
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
As I said, Ron's here.

563
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,000
So certainly busy Monday and Tuesday and we'll be preparing for stuff tomorrow in London.

564
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And also, I hope you had time to stop and think about to 777,

565
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
which was the 7th of July.

566
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
The one year anniversary of the bombings in London,

567
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
a hard spot to those people as well.

568
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Hey, everybody.

569
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I'll see you on podshow.com on the plus side.

570
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Bye-bye.

571
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Another podshow podcast.

572
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Stick it in your ear.

573
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Get this podcast and we're great ones like it on the high performance podcast

574
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
delivery network from Podshow and line-white networks.

575
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I love it.
