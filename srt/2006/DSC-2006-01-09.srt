1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,040
Delta Sierra Charlie 312, hey everybody, how you doing?

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,400
That's my take-tax right there.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,520
Welcome, I'm in the curry condo, actually.

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,200
I'm about 40 feet underground.

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:33,160
I got in a couple hours ago, I'm back in the bay area, and I'm looking forward to a couple

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:40,800
of weeks of getting a lot of cool shit done, and I'm jet lagging just a bit.

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,360
Now of course when you come back to the bachelor pad, you've got to make sure everything

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,520
is still operational and everything is right, and so I'm down on the garage to check on

9
00:00:50,520 --> 00:01:00,720
Trinity, and she's still here, you do a quick external scan, everything looks pretty

10
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:09,840
much the way it was, with those rear lights out, let me see, a warning parking violation.

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:29,520
That was that, parked over the line into another parking space, what was this all about?

12
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:39,800
Okay, I see, other people have a parking pass, all right, oh man, I'm like,

13
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:48,160
right on the line, I'm not over the line, it's a freaking boat that I have to park in here.

14
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,360
God, and how about this murk?

15
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,400
No, what is this a G500?

16
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,680
That's parked over the line, did he get it?

17
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,680
Citation?

18
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
No.

19
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:09,760
Okay, all right, anyway, so what we're really here to do is to see if she'll still start.

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,660
Because it would really suck if I needed, if I needed her services and she wouldn't crank

21
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,660
up.

22
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:27,520
So here we go, yep, looks like this battery left, plugs are glowing, I'm going to wait

23
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:34,200
for the glow light to go off, here we go, oh my God, can you believe that?

24
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:45,560
Holy, holy roll, oh my God.

25
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,360
Smell that biodiesel, baby, I have it all figured out, by the way, I know exactly what's

26
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,560
going on with the biodiesel.

27
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:03,520
Ah yes, you can buy this kit and it costs about, what is it, $3000.

28
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:12,520
And with that, you can make up to 40 gallons of biodiesel per batch.

29
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:20,680
And I found out that this is the stuff that is mixed with methanol and lye to basically wash

30
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,600
out the oil.

31
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:32,120
And then you can use that, except the refined oil basically, the refined vegetable oil, which

32
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,040
you can get from Mexican restaurants, Chinese restaurants, all kinds of restaurants.

33
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:49,040
Anyone who deep fries basically, and how this is so cool, I can't believe she works.

34
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,600
Anyway, so it's exactly that, that is the stuff that you can throw right into the tank.

35
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,120
Now, the groovy thing is, you don't really need a conversion kit for it.

36
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,920
You can throw it straight into any diesel engine, any diesel engine.

37
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,800
The Trinity has, I think most cars, pre-1985, have to have this.

38
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:14,880
You need different hoses that are made of, I guess it's, what is it, an acrylic versus rubber.

39
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,760
That's the only difference that Trinity has because Trinity is, that's the car that I

40
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:27,480
mean if you're, if you're new to the show, is from 1984.

41
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,480
So, how badass is that?

42
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:39,400
Starts after, what is, oh, smells so good, french fries, loving, now what is this?

43
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,640
I'm quite full of all these doors again.

44
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,280
It's stupid.

45
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,720
So I guess what I'll be looking for pretty soon, somewhere in the Bay Area,

46
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:59,000
the preferably south of market is a grime space where I can have some floccal.

47
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,400
There's some kind of central unlocking, but no central locking system.

48
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Now, she's a view.

49
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,160
Hey, I'll tell you what, why don't we get the show started right now?

50
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,920
Another day is here and I am still alive.

51
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,720
I'll say these words aloud, they speak from the inside.

52
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:33,720
And every time I see you, you just walk away, still the world is done in.

53
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,640
I want to hear while you, what you've got to say,

54
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,480
I want to hear while you, what you've got to say,

55
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,160
I want to hear while you, what you've got to say,

56
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,320
I want to hear while you, what you've got to say,

57
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,600
hey, hey, hey,

58
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Oh, my mug is all made up, I'm through it all I can, I'm trying hard to think but I can't understand why every time I see you you just walk away

59
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Still the world is dying, I will not complain

60
00:06:51,600 --> 00:07:08,600
My head is spinning around, I don't know what to do if I'm so happy I got everything to use

61
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,600
And every time I see you, I can't understand why every time I see you

62
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,600
And now you're always waiting for the right to see you

63
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:41,600
And every time I see you, you just walk away

64
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Still the world is dying, I will not complain

65
00:07:50,600 --> 00:08:06,600
I want to hear what you, what you've got to say, what you've got to say, what you've got to say

66
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Oh, are these kids?

67
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,600
It's the subways I tell you, I want to hear what you've got to say

68
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
From a young three turn to date

69
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,600
All of a sudden they just showed up in the podcast music network

70
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,600
I'm like, whoa, where have these guys and apparently gals been hiding out

71
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Hey everybody, how you doing?

72
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Welcome to the Daily Source Code, it's Monday, it's a great Monday

73
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
I was up very early this morning

74
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Yep, because I was in the right place at the right time for once

75
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,600
I've never once heard our shows on serious on stars 103

76
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,600
I've never heard the pod show line up because every time I'm here, I'm always busy during the day

77
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Because it airs between 3 and 7 p.m. on the west coast

78
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,600
But this morning, got to brighten early to listen to Howard Stern

79
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
We started today

80
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Yauza

81
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,600
He is in a way he is kind of the original podcast I have to say

82
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,600
But he's always had the restrictions on so this is a whole new era that has opened up before our very ears

83
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,600
Anyway, so Trinity's running just fine, I was walking upstairs and I was looking at this citation

84
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,600
I'm here in the condo, so I don't have the regular set up

85
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
I did bring the Heil microphone this time

86
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,600
I still like the sound so much better of the Heil microphone

87
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,600
But I don't have the podcast complex

88
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,600
So I'm back to my bending over and kind of leaning on the open kitchen bar here where I had to set up

89
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,600
You know, leaning on my arms, leaning over everything, this is very uncomfortable

90
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Here we go, so I guess what happened is I got a parking violation

91
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
So they say I was improperly parked

92
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,600
I was like right on the line, okay, I mean I got these really fat tires on the Trinity

93
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:15,600
This eggnog, yellow, Mercedes, station wagon, 300 turbo diesel running on biodiesel baby

94
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,600
And it also says that I did not have the metropolitan ID, that's the building that I live in

95
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,600
So I don't have the proper ID and I did notice that every other car in the lot ID

96
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,600
So I guess I got to get one of those but probably what happened is they clamped me because it even says here

97
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,600
It's not checked the box is not checked that it'll be told

98
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Let me see when was this ticket written on the 16th of December

99
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Okay, right, but then here there was another card attached to the windshield

100
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Harry Shin, Harmony Construction Management Service

101
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Well, I guess that would be part of the building management on the back of it written in pen

102
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Want to remove wheel bumper call Harry

103
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,600
You left this cell phone number, but I didn't see anything what didn't what I did my walk around

104
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,600
So I don't know, maybe they just took it off because it like man, the thing was on there for weeks or whatever

105
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Let's see, quote of the day for you today from Diane Frolov and Andrew Schneider

106
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
I like this one a lot

107
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,600
A man should not leave this earth with unfinished business

108
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,600
He should live each day as if it was a pre flight check. He should ask each morning

109
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Am I prepared to lift off and I like that one a lot Raymond Port if you remember Raymond

110
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,600
He's the guy that was listening to the daily source code in a traffic jam

111
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Well, I was recording one in the same traffic jam and we caught up with each other and this was

112
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,600
How was that a year ago? He had more than a year ago, I guess he sent me an email

113
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,600
He said that he had the exact same. I did a quote of the day the other day. Was it Victoria Holt

114
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Yeah, I think it was Victoria Holt. I don't remember what the quote was and he said that he had exactly the same quote on his weblog

115
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,600
And of course, we both the obviously subscribe to motivational quotes of the day, so that's kind of how that happened

116
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Over the weekend before my trip because I left Sunday morning. I was

117
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:18,600
I kind of got dragged into something that I usually don't partake in, but I really got enthralled by a whole bunch of new videos that are out

118
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,600
And available online with new 9-11

119
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Quote evidence and

120
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,600
There's this one that was done really well. It was it was compiled out of a whole bunch of different news reports and

121
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Amateur video photographs, but it was all basically done on a timeline and I was thinking to myself

122
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,600
This is something really cool, you know when you have an event like 9-11

123
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,600
But you could really it could be a ball game any event is okay

124
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
If you can time all of the media

125
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
And this is really like this is matrix shit

126
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,600
You know this is what you get when you sit in the cottage for weeks on end and you know smoke go

127
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,600
So let's just take a football stadium for that matter

128
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,600
And again, so a football game

129
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,600
If everyone who took pictures or video or audio or any other type of media of that event

130
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
If they could sync it to time code

131
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,600
Then you in theory will be able and it was all uploaded to a central database of course

132
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,600
In theory you could go back and you could kind of restruct events based upon material that is there

133
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Just imagine like a big

134
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
Final cut pro timeline or Adobe addition

135
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
Excuse me, that's tea not sincere

136
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,600
But really a multi a huge infinite number of tracks

137
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,600
And if you want to be cool, you could scroll back and forth through that

138
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,600
And then see the images all these different ones

139
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Of course you wouldn't be able to see thousands, but you could choose ones

140
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,600
And in this total Tom Cruise futuristic thing that I have in my head

141
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,600
You'd be able to scroll up and to the right and basically three dimensions

142
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,600
But wouldn't it be interesting if we could put something like that together for any kind of event

143
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:15,600
It really would work and I think that most cameras now are pretty good at adding metadata to their digital pictures

144
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
Which includes time code

145
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:31,600
Of course you could you could do it from multiple dimensions because you could also have let's say an airplane flying over the stadium that airplane could upload it's GPS track

146
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,600
I don't know if it's something about it just kind of start buzzing in my head and just want to throw it out there

147
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,600
Let me see I have a link here, I want to show what this link was to let me see

148
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,600
Oh, this is it. Yeah, it's the loose change 911 the Alex Jones conspiracy. I found it on the Google video

149
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,600
And it's I'll just play a little bit at the beginning of it

150
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:05,600
I think it's a complete amateur job, but it's very very well done and apparently all done in Final Cut Pro

151
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Well, then it gets in all these titles and stuff that I'm not going to read for you

152
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Let me see where am I here okay lots and lots of feedback about the power books sound loops apparently this is

153
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Now this is a problem that I was able to demonstrate to you on Friday's show

154
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:40,600
I have a brand new it's one of the brand new Apple Macintosh power books. I have the 15 inch and there seems to be some kind of problem with the audio

155
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Where inadvertently and not really replicable, but just at any given moment

156
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Your audio of all sudden can start looping it goes into this like this echo this repeating dead

157
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,600
Almost like the CD is skipping in fact. This is exactly like a CD skipping. It doesn't really skip, but it just hangs there

158
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Well, man, I got a lot of feedback about this

159
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,600
It seems that this is definitely a problem

160
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Lots of people have it. Let me see Tim from Latvia

161
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,600
He sent, but basically a whole bunch of people sent me links to pretty much the same solution

162
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Scott Tyler said he thought he heard it managed had that problem

163
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
Let me see

164
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Okay, I think was Brad here

165
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,600
So there's this link on MacLife.com. Is it MacLife?

166
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
No wait

167
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
MacILife.com

168
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,600
There you go, possible fix for the 15 inch power book. Basically, and if you have this problem

169
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,600
You got to find that link and of course it'll show up in the show notes in the time code they show notes for sure

170
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,600
You go to your preferences and you have to delete a file basically it's your Apple audio preferences file

171
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,600
And then you reboot when the file is recreated automatically, but I guess that there's something that can get really messed up by

172
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,600
Using some combination of applications that I don't know it just gets confused that seems to be the fix that's working the best so far

173
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,600
And I haven't had the problem of course I haven't really been doing a lot of sound intensive stuff over the past couple of days

174
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,600
But it is working so far so fingers crossed and I'll keep you up the speed on that

175
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Hey Adam, it's Michael's whirling the owner of two independent talk radio stations KSCO and KOMY in the moderate bay area

176
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
But please don't hold that against me

177
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Fact is listening to your podcasts with all the great audio clips from other podcasters has made my bay area power walks so wonderfully entertaining and amazingly enlightening

178
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:49,600
That I'm seriously considering selling the broadcast boat anchors and doing true real innovative unbridled and unstifled original podcasting full time

179
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,600
What a revelation not only do I not need no stink and transmitters?

180
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:02,600
I really don't need no stink and ask cap BMI and C-SAC fees no stink and public file maintenance no stink and EEO reports

181
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:12,600
No stink and transmitter readings no stink and FCC inspections no stink and discontented and resentful employees no stink and enormous power and telephone bills

182
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,600
No stink and license renewal and no stink and constant engineering headaches

183
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Now I know all that makes me sound like some bitter negative person, but I am truly thankful to be a very proud independent broadcaster

184
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Who is beholden to nobody because I discovered a much more powerful way to make money than selling 30 and 60 second spots in radio

185
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:41,600
And this is made it possible for me to thumb my nose at clear channels and infinities of the world and more than support my radio have it

186
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:49,600
I just love being able to tell the big boys to shove it when they try to bully us what's most exciting about podcasting though

187
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Is that it offers all of the fun and virtually none of the headaches of broadcasting and I think the same innovative alternative money making principles

188
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:05,600
I have successfully employed as a small independent broadcaster would work even better in the world of podcasting

189

Tailwinds continued success and peace of mind to you and all podcasters and podcast listeners from MZ

191
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Yo dude, y'all there you go there you have it guys leaving radio at least that's what I understood from the comment he's leaving radio

192
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
Owns two stations in Monterey

193
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,600
Isn't that like a stoner surfer dude paradise out there in Monterey isn't that what kind of goes on out there?

194
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,600
I should check out these radio stations. I wonder if he actually did sell them that would be very interesting

195
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,600
That's for sure, but wow, do you hear that list of shit that he has to go through?

196
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,600
I'd forgotten all about that and of course you had the official sign-ons and sign-offs and the logs

197
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Oh man boy so much to do there

198
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,600
He said tailwinds at the end

199
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,600
You know that's our pilot speak for a hey buddy

200
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
I know you're a pilot I'm a pilot too

201
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Guess what I ordered by first item off of eBay and it has to do with aviation

202
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:15,600
I was looking for a Garmin GPS map one nine or five which is all the pros use it. It's actually an older model

203
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,600
Of Garmin GPS they have new ones which are really actually very beautiful collar ones with terrain mapping and stuff

204
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,600
But all the pros use this old one this and it could I think basically because it has the largest screen

205
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,600
To date still of any handheld GPS and it's a pretty big unit

206
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:38,600
But I was able to pick one I found it on eBay. I was looking for one and eBay actually had a whole bunch of them for sale

207
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,600
And I'd never bought anything on eBay before in my life

208
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,600
And since the item said and of course this is one of these buying now

209
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,600
So I guess just a dealer of second hand GPS units. It wasn't really an auction per say

210
00:20:51,600 --> 00:21:00,600
It said we'd only ship in the USA so I gave the condo address and there it was man when I arrived today

211
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Waiting there for me and I put batteries in and it powered up and it was really happy with my purchase

212
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,600
So I have to go tell everyone on his on his profile that he's a good eBayer

213
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,600
And now I'm an eBayer too, I feel so incredibly proud of myself

214
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Christina was eBaying the other day on tickets for panic at the disco

215
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600
Have you heard of those guys?

216
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
I don't think I can play him anymore

217
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,600
They were pod safe for like half a second and then they got signed

218
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,600
I think they're signed now and they're on tour and it's like some grungy tour

219
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,600
She wants to go and so I said okay, I'll drop you in your friend off

220
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Like all those parents do they sit outside and drink drink coffee and smoke cigarettes and read books

221
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:49,600
If you're listening to this podcast that daily source code on serious stars one oh three

222
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:56,600
We have three and a half more hours of pod show on the way for you Pacific Coast Hellway is next

223
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,600
I want you to listen to this for a second. This is pretty funny. Derrick had a question

224
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,600
How's it going? I know how you love

225
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Love audio comments, so I sent you one. I really love your show. I'm a new listener

226
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,600
And I'm kind of dabbling and podcasting myself not with it

227
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:22,600
Like with not much success though, mainly due to content but I'm working on it

228
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,600
Anyways, I was just wondering where you get your really cool

229
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,600
Intro is for your segments, you know like the mental sexual moment and also your

230
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
Trinity moment

231
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
One that I saw in your last episode

232
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,600
So yeah, I just wondering where you got those thanks

233
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
I dare

234
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,600
Well, just so happens that when I get you know what the cool thing is that I barely have to do anything myself

235
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,600
For the what we call the imaging of this particular podcast

236
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Dave Fox has done a whole bunch for me Marcus couch from

237
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,600
The scenes scenes and a lot of stuff that I use and Jeff Smith showed up just recently

238
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,600
He did the Trinity theme. He did the Metro sexual moment theme

239
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,600
And he actually came up with something new for me. I don't have

240
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,600
I don't have anything to play in the item for today

241
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,600
At least I don't have anything cute up for you, but this is basically I asked for it

242
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,600
And I just kind of set it off handedly and this is what I love so much about this stuff

243
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Your audience actually helps you create the show. This is really total interactivity

244
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
One day

245
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Here it

246
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,600
It's Yadsey

247
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
YADC yet another

248
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
Another drum cadence

249
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,600
Yadsey

250
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
And he has a cheer

251
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:04,600
So that's what's cool about this stuff is it just kind of pops up people make stuff send it in. I love it

252
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,600
And that's what makes it really work and I see this happening all over the place

253
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,600
Imagine as people make entire songs for it's outrageous

254
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,600
I mean Dawn and Drew listen all the feedback they get that they put at the end of their shows

255
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:22,600
It's and Dawn and Drew also coming up on stars 103 in about what is it about an hour from now

256
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,600
And we'll see you guys tomorrow enjoy Howard and enjoy the rest of the pod show

257
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,600
And those of you on the podcast stay tuned and wave goodbye to the satellite folks

258
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,600
There you go

259
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,600
I'll just talk about Roger Smalls

260
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,600
Michelle

261
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:46,600
You know this has happened a few times now with this Roger guy I didn't mention anything but after this last time this one Roger sent me a

262
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,600
He sent me a comment that

263
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:55,600
He thought the plastic bags it sainsberries where we do our shopping are a bit weak that you really need to double bag everything

264
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:03,600
So Michelle says here's my reaction whenever you say that you have an audio comment from Roger Smalls coming up my skin starts crawling my heart starts beating faster

265
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,600
I get immediately tense we have a word for guys like him and Southern California it's called stalker

266
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:14,600
You completely creeps me out the fact this bad enough that he goes through your garbage I only did it once

267
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,600
But that he also hangs out at the grocery store you shop at and hopes of running into you is just very scary

268
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,600
You do seem to have him at bay and I'm sure you've probably had stalkers around you for a long time no not really

269
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:32,600
But nonetheless I wanted you to know that I'm sitting here in California having a visceral scared reaction to just even hearing Roger's voice

270
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,600
Half the thing he's done would already warrant a restraining order out here

271
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,600
Come on my experiences

272
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,600
You know guys like Roger and girls like Roger they just I'm sorry Roger didn't mean to come out like that

273
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:56,600
They're fans he's just a fan of the show and he's really into it and he's podcasting in this cool. He seems he seems like a pretty cool dude

274
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,600
Match has my back on that too

275
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,600
What is this I had one two more things I wanted to share with Patty San

276
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,400
Tanjolo what was this about I just oh right

277
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,600
Yeah, I don't know if you heard about this Patty San Tanjolo

278
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:23,600
Here's the here's the headlines mother of five fighting record companies lawsuit on her own mother goes solo and fight with record companies

279
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:30,600
Mom fights downloading suit on her own internet illiterate single mom takes on recording industry

280
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:37,600
So you've got to read about this woman who got a call from the settlement center

281
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:47,600
You know this is the record companies the RIA they just have like a like a boiler room operation where on behalf of the record companies there

282
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
I guess they

283
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,600
They figure out that people have been sharing

284
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:02,600
License music through their computers how they exactly find that out is unclear from any article I've been able to read

285
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:10,600
But they said look you know we're gonna sue you because there's music has been shared from your computer, so you're a pirate you're a thief and

286
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Apparently it was what was being used because I think and she had some great quotes in here

287
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:24,600
One thing that was pretty interesting. Oh, I was that she had a funny quote

288
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Well, basically she said she had no idea what what cuzaw was and she'd never heard of it and then she says

289
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,600
I very sure

290
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:46,600
I very strong feelings about how if this did happen on my computer cuzaw could allow a child to obtain an account that could be potentially dangerous to the child

291
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Cuz of course the RIA is going after kids now as well

292
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:56,600
Dangerous to the child and the parent without parental authorization or the authorization of the person who owned the computer, and of course

293
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,600
He's right about that

294
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
But the whole point is

295
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:08,600
That they said they were well, you know you can settle for three and a half thousand dollars which of course is ludicrous and she can't afford a lawyer

296
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:16,400
So what she's doing is she's gonna stand up for it in court. She's taken it all the way and she's gonna defend herself

297
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:25,600
And even her lawyer who she can't afford anymore said she'll win this thing, but this is just crazy. So Google it patty Santangelo

298
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:33,600
And I think that even I've seen several different PayPal donation links pop up here and there so you can help her with the fight

299
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:42,600
I think it's actually a Dutch group who had done a group of Dutch people who had done that as well. I'll look around for it and hopefully that also show up in the show notes

300
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,600
Okay, one last song from the podcast music network from so that's music.podshow.com

301
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:54,600
A lot of hip hop showing up and also some stuff from Germany. I think podcasting is actually starting to pop open in Germany

302
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
For a number of different reasons you know it's a big ass market

303
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:05,600
They're really not happy with their with their broadcast situation and I'm just amazed by some of the stuff that I've been hearing

304
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,600
So this song will be in German obviously

305
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:19,600
You know, I just had some kind of cool to it. I've was that the name of this group is Simon says and that's S-A-I-Z

306
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:29,600
I guess they mean Simon says they have a whole collection on the on the network got some reggae got some rock got some funk pretty interesting

307
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,600
This is Echt de Lieber from a find out of Deutschland

308
00:29:40,600 --> 00:30:01,160
Now which boring thing is going on because in the near mile

309
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,600
I think I'll do it twice. I'm amazed

310
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
You're the same as I might as well.

311
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,760
You're the guy who killed my killer?

312
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,860
I kept asking,

313
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,560
saying you're my cứ red sphere,

314
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,360
saying you're not that hungry,

315
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,220
so should't be screwed up and asked.

316
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,480
He was in my Arab court for two years,

317
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,120
trying to get my school no less,

318
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,080
go for 5 to 15 weeks to Serves

319
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,340
and three miles out.

320
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,320
Shut up, I have no idea what's going on here.

321
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,940
Now there's 23 points one last time

322
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,680
Again we can be tryin

323
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,020

It's the truth, my guess is the truth.

330
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,320
It's the content that not better more than that.

331
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,320
It's the truth.

332
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,320
