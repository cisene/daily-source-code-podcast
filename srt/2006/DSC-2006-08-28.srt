1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
This is Soccer Girl. I just listened to the first episode of Shadow Falls and it's scared me

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,400
crapless.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:44,800
With $16 million worth of airplanes stuck to his lips, whilst sucking on the P2 and the

4
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:52,240
next generation radio content in his ears, it's the daily source code episode 450 with Adam

5
00:00:52,240 --> 00:01:05,240
Curry.

6
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:16,240
You talk of the game, but you wrap your guilt around me, when you don't get your way.

7
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:25,240
You bleed on this plane, clean your cut, wrap it up, take care of your own pain.

8
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,240
Cause it's you, not me.

9
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:39,240
It's gonna set you free, and I'm sorry, but I don't have the time, and it's me, not you.

10
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:51,240
It ends up feeling used, and I'm sorry, baby, but I'm not responsible.

11
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,240
Why can't you let it go?

12
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:01,240
Yeah, because all that joke crying about, happened to years ago, all more.

13
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,240
You hit rock bottom now, you're pacing into flow.

14
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:12,240
But what I'm talking about is climbing out when no one's ill, but you're wrong cause it's you.

15
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
Not me.

16
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:24,240
It's gonna set you free, and I'm sorry, but I don't have the time, and it's me, not you.

17
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,240
It ends up feeling used, and I'm sorry, baby, but I'm not responsible.

18
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,240
Go somewhere, go and stand up by yourself.

19
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:51,240
Cause I ain't taking no more, I need the reason no more, and it's me.

20
00:02:51,240 --> 00:03:05,240
It's gonna set you free, and I'm sorry, but I don't have the time, and it's me, not you.

21
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:12,240
It ends up feeling used, and I'm sorry, baby, but I'm not, so sorry.

22
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:26,240
It's gonna set you free, and I'm sorry, but I don't have the time, and it's me, not you.

23
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:37,240
It ends up feeling used, and I'm sorry, baby, but I'm not, so sorry, baby, but I'm not.

24
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:46,240
I'm not, sorry, so sorry, baby, but I'm not, sorry, baby, but I'm not responsible.

25
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,240
Lord, clap, I'm not responsible from the Podsafe music network.

26
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,240
Hey, everybody, good morning.

27
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,240
This is a different time for me to be recording the Daily Source Code.

28
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:02,240
It's early Monday morning, and you probably woke up this morning if you went to your podgeo

29
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,240
plus a con or your iTunes or whatever, and went to, oh my goodness, there's a source code already.

30
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:15,240
That's right, but the time you're listening to this, I'm probably midway the English channel on my way over to Amsterdam with Patricia.

31
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:22,240
She has some paperwork that she's got to take care of for our complete integration into Britain.

32
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:31,240
So, it reminds you, this is something that, you know, going actually from the United Kingdom to the mainland to the continent and flying back.

33
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Landing in both places in one day, I have to point out is something that Hitler never accomplished.

34
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:44,240
I had a question about the Podsafe music network on Friday, and answers came streaming in.

35
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
Hello, Adam.

36
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,240
It's Martin, aka GD, from GD's Bite Size Bonus.

37
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Congratulations to you, young man.

38
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,240
You've actually got round to play in Paper Rogers at long last.

39
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Yes, he's on the Podsafe music network, but if you've been listening to my show Bite Size Bonus,

40
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,240
by sizeblownest.podshow.com, you'd have been hearing paper a lot.

41
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:10,240
We've been playing the last 18 months, and she is tremendous artist, as she's a lovely young lady, and she's from Wales.

42
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Now, he's a personal invite to you, Adam.

43
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,240
If you want to see some great live music and meet over podcasters, come down to Podfest.

44
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,240
Yes, Podfest.

45
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Thursday, the 19th of October at the Purple Turtle, Canada London, that's the 19th of October.

46
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,240
Oh yeah, by the way, I can fold her fold, of course.

47
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
Purple Turtle.

48
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
Hey, dude.

49
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,240
October the 9th was that what it was, Podfest.

50
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,240
Semi, a URL, a link.

51
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,240
So I can find out more about it.

52
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,240
If I'm in town, you bet you, of course, I'll drop by, I'd love to.

53
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:49,240
It looks like I'm going to be here all through September, since we've got all kinds of cool stuff happening with Podshow UK.

54
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,240
Why am I doing this show so early in the morning?

55
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,240
Well, because, well, I knew I had to fly with Patricia, and I couldn't do it a Sunday.

56
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,240
Because Sunday evening, last night, the night we just are moving away from Christina.

57
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,240
Lovely daughter celebrated her sweet 16th birthday on her actual birthday, which is nice.

58
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:18,240
It's a bank holiday in England, which means that everyone has Monday off, so she had a party from six to midnight at the stoke to pub in Guilford.

59
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,240
Very, very hard.

60
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:26,240
If you've been following along, very hard to actually get a place that will allow teenagers because there's always, you know,

61
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,240
It's always a little bit of a problem.

62
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
We had done it, I think, perfectly.

63
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Actually Patricia did it perfectly.

64
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:39,240
It was essentially a place where you could have a wedding reception or any kind of party.

65
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
And it was an Alice in Wonderland theme, Christina.

66
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
And I have do have pictures in video.

67
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,240
And of course, I'll be showing that soon on the perversion for profit, my video show.

68
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,240
That'll be on next week.

69
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,240
You know, she was dressed like Alice in Wonderland.

70
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,240
And it was great.

71
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,240
All these kids showed up with, you know, like, money, ears on, and mad hat or hats.

72
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,240
And they really, you know, well, not every single one of them.

73
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,240
There's a lot of tattoos.

74
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,240
They were, had nothing to do with Alice in Wonderland.

75
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,240
They were just on the kids who came.

76
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,240
A lot of pants falling off asses.

77
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,240
But we didn't serve alcohol even though many of them were over 18.

78
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
Most were probably between 16 and 18.

79
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,240
But of course, they were more than welcome to, you know, walk around the neighborhood, find whatever they could.

80
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
And it actually turned out great.

81
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,240
Everyone loved the, what was that stuff?

82
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,240
The J2O.

83
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,240
Some sickly sugar drink.

84
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
The kids love that shit.

85
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,240
They just, they were drinking it like no one else's business.

86
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,240
Of course, I'm counting them.

87
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,240
Each, you know, go up and get three, four bottles.

88
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

89
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Because it was just a regular bar, you know.

90
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,240
I'm just paying for great food.

91
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,240
Christina had a DJ who was great.

92
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,240
You know, kids brought some of their own CDs.

93
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,240
But he had a real good mix of stuff.

94
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,240
And Christina was really, really, really, really happy.

95
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
And at the end of a day like that to hear, say,

96
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,240
Mom and Dad, thank you so much.

97
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,240
You know, that really did it for me.

98
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
So I'm so happy.

99
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,240
And I didn't even have to drive the brand new convertible into the,

100
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,240
Into the party with the, with the bow around it.

101
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,240
I said, though, I will have some footage of that.

102
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,240
Next week on perversion for profit.

103
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,240
I have a, a new version, a new show ready to go.

104
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,240
My video show.

105
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,240
You can find that pfp dot pod show dot com perversion for profit.

106
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,240
It's not up yet when I get back from from Amsterdam tonight.

107
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Then I just have to do my segments.

108
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
I think you're really going to like it.

109
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
I'm starting to get a real feel.

110
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
People are sending stuff in.

111
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,240
It's, you know, it's going to be about 10 minutes, which is really nice.

112
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,240
You know, if you have a video iPod or some other,

113
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
Or even your laptop, I guess.

114
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,240
You know, it may be just something you can check out on the train.

115
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,240
If you drive in, obviously, a little more difficult or it work.

116
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
It's, uh, I think you'll get a kick out of it.

117
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,240
We got some, uh, some good clips on for you.

118
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
Uh, let's see, voicemail.

119
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Still getting, I didn't go through the whole voicemail box.

120
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,240
I saw there about 25 messages waiting.

121
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,240
If you want to call, though, you know the number,

122
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,240
But now, plus one, two, zero, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven.

123
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,240
You can find that a daily source code dot com in the show notes.

124
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Adam, I like your show.

125
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,240
But you got to stop demonizing the scrunchers.

126
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
I mean, come on.

127
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,240
You putting out a survey to try and find out who,

128
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,240
Not who, but how many people scrunch and how many people fold.

129
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
Uh-huh.

130
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,240
And then you tell the audience what you do.

131
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,240
And you make it painfully clear that anyone who doesn't do what you do is.

132
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
Is consummately evil?

133
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Yes, you are.

134
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,240
I mean, scrunchers are even doing the results a little bit.

135
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
Come on, man.

136
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
Lighten up on the scrunchers.

137
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,240
In other news, house prices in the UK.

138
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,240
Uh, did you know a little site called up my street.com.

139
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,240
You can punch in the postcode for the house that you're looking to buy.

140
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
Not having to buy my alley.com.

141
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
That's a different site altogether.

142
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,240
Out within a specified radius.

143
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,240
How much houses around that are selling for.

144
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
It's a great little research tool.

145
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,240
Check it out up my street.com.

146
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
Okay.

147
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,240
That's it for today.

148
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
Adam.

149
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Thanks a lot.

150
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
And I might want to mention my name.

151
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
Yes.

152
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
It's David Wink.

153
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
I'm 32.

154
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
American.

155
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,240
Listener and London.

156
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,240
Since about May 05.

157
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,240
And I love the show.

158
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
I know.

159
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Tailwinds.

160
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Oh, scruncher.

161
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,240
Pilot and scruncher.

162
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,240
There is a disproportion amount of scrunchers amongst pilots.

163
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
I've noticed.

164
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,240
Yeah, I really love the fact that you guys are still calling in with your listener profiles.

165
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,240
It's really helping me understand who you are and trying to tailor the show more towards

166
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,240
Torchee.

167
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:41,240
So far, average age about 32 and the scruncher still have it.

168
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,240
Did I say that?

169
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,240
Did I say scruncher still have it?

170
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
Hi, Adam.

171
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
My name is Matt.

172
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,240
I'm 32 years old.

173
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,240
I'm responding to your call out to have your listeners calling and introduce themselves.

174
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,240
I'm doing that right now.

175
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,240
Again, when he's Matt of 32 years old, I do not have a podcast.

176
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,240
I was introduced to your show by Guyning Joe Barlow.

177
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,240
Finally, a slave podcast.

178
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
It's going to be a slave.com.

179
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
And I know I'm a little late.

180
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
Probably.

181
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,240
I'm catching up on your shows.

182
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,240
But I live in Ohio.

183
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
And I work for a college in Pennsylvania.

184
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,240
And I was driving back to Pennsylvania to come back to campus to do some more.

185
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,240
And I was catching up on your podcasts when my ear buds in.

186
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,240
And my wife was sleeping.

187
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
And I heard the call out.

188
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,240
And I thought it's probably not a good idea for me to call right now.

189
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,240
Because I really didn't move my wife's face up to me saying hi, Adam.

190
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,240
I'm 32 years old.

191
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,240
You get the idea.

192
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,240
So anyway, I just wanted to say I like your show.

193
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,240
And I was supposed to do it as much as I can.

194
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
Oh, hello.

195
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,240
Is this going to late?

196
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
I'm a folder.

197
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,240
All right.

198
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,240
Thanks, dude.

199
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,240
Appreciate it.

200
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
Yeah, keep those calls coming.

201
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,240
It really helps.

202
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,240
Hey, I wish you could wish that this were live.

203
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,240
Sometimes I missed that.

204
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,240
Because, you know, if I knew that where you were right now was also middle of the night.

205
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,240
I got a candle burning here on top of the the console where I create the magic.

206
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,240
Just the glow of the secondary monitor kind of against my face.

207
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,240
I've got one light dimmed in the background.

208
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,240
Everyone's asleep.

209
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,240
I don't know.

210
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,240
I think Christina is just about going to sleep.

211
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,240
She was obviously pretty excited.

212
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
I wish you could feel that vibe with me.

213
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,240
I wish you could feel it.

214
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
Yo, AC.

215
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,240
What's up?

216
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,240
It's AB.

217
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
A big crack radio.

218
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,240
Hey, man.

219
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,240
I've been listening to your past few shows.

220
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,240
And I'm just curious, man.

221
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,240
What is your perspective on all this kind of cultural sex.

222
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,240
Nakedness thing that is going on.

223
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,240
Like Europeans have a very different perspective on that.

224
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,240
And, you know, it's very different.

225
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,240
Why do we Americans seem to be still fairly uptight about things like naked pictures

226
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,240
and press releases that talk about how to women.

227
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,240
I mean, give me a fucking break.

228
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:15,240
You know, I was looking on the web and I think it's ABC ran a story.

229
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:22,240
Just tell your listeners, like Google, like Google naked.

230
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,240
Number times men think sex.

231
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,240
Go Google that.

232
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,240
Number times men think sex.

233
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,240
And you'll find a few articles about this.

234
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:37,240
So, you know, it's like just reality here that you might ask somebody for naked pictures.

235
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:43,240
In fact, you know, maybe it should just be the normal, you know, mode of interaction.

236
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,240
Hey, nice to meet you.

237
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,240
How about some, could I see some naked pictures with that be cool?

238
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
All right.

239
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
Thank you very much, here are mine.

240
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
Very good.

241
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,240
I mean, what the fuck is my space all about?

242
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,240
You know, it's basically that.

243
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,240
So anyway, man, love to hear your perspective.

244
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,240
And I'll talk to you soon.

245
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,240
Take it easy.

246
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
All right.

247
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,240
A to the B from the C.

248
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,240
From, you know what, I just googled that.

249
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,240
Times men think sex.

250
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
Okay.

251
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
Top link.

252
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,240
Primetime live poll.

253
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,240
American sex survey from ABC News.

254
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,240
Sometimes it's just about sex.

255
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,240
Usually not the vast majority of Americans are monogamous and happy about it.

256
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,240
Expressing satisfaction with their sex lives and abroad preference for emotional

257
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
commitment and sexual relationships.

258
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
That's bullshit.

259
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,240
Most by far prefer marriage to the single life.

260
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,240
Yeah, that's different.

261
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,240
The vast majority of Americans are monogamous.

262
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,240
I don't believe it.

263
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,240
I just don't.

264
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:47,240
When you call in, please say if you're a scruncher, folder monogamous or not.

265
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,240
Let's see.

266
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,240
57% of Americans have had sex outdoors in a public place.

267
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,240
Half talk with their partners about their sexual fantasies.

268
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,240
42% called themselves sexually adventurous.

269
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:05,240
29% have had sex on a first date and about as many of had an unexpected sexual encounter

270
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
with someone new.

271
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
How many?

272
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
What's the percentage?

273
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
They're 29%.

274
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,240
Almost a third.

275
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,240
15% of men and 3 in 10 single men aged 30 and older have paid for sex.

276
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,240
Okay.

277
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,240
How many times they think about it?

278
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
It doesn't.

279
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
Man is like a whole article.

280
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,240
Oh, here.

281
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,240
Sex in gender gap.

282
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Think sex about everyday men.

283
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
70% women.

284
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,240
34%.

285
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,240
Enjoy sex.

286
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
A great deal.

287
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
Men.

288
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
83% women.

289
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
59%.

290
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Okay.

291
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Come on.

292
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,240
You know what it is?

293
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,240
I think that it wasn't at all the Puritans who the Pilgrims who wanted to leave this

294
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
debotuous place, this England.

295
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,240
I mean, isn't that just in the culture of the United States?

296
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,240
I think it is.

297
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
You know?

298
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,240
But it's there.

299
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,240
Mm-hmm.

300
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,240
It's the hidden underground.

301
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,240
It's coming out.

302
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,240
Listen to some of the eroticopod casts.

303
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
There's some.

304
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,240
There's some kinky shit going on in the States.

305
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,240
It's okay.

306
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
You know.

307
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,240
We can pretend.

308
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
We're not doing anything nasty.

309
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,240
Have you ever listened to the weekly radio address podcast?

310
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,240
I love this show.

311
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,240
And I rediscovered it in the program guide on poncho plus poncho.com.

312
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
Yeah, I know I'm Hawking it.

313
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,240
But it's cool because we have a whole bunch of channels there split by genre.

314
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
And this was in the comedy channel.

315
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,240
I forgot all about it.

316
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,240
I think at one point we actually had the real president's radio address.

317
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,240
They're instead of the weekly radio address podcast.

318
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
And it was okay because it was just a funny thing.

319
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,240
And now a message from the president of the United States, George W. Bush.

320
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,240
Good morning.

321
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,240
The airline security of the American people is a top priority of my administration.

322
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
We cannot do it alone, however.

323
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,240
We rely on tips from the public of suspicious activity area ports.

324
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,240
This week I learned of a direct threat to our nation's airliners in an important telephone call.

325
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,240
I'd like to play that call for you in its entirety.

326
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,240
George, this is Samuel L. Jackson.

327
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,240
I'm here today to make sure you go see snakes on a plate.

328
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,240
Sneaks.

329
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,240
I know that sounds crazy, but I don't give a damn.

330
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,240
So listen.

331
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
I mean, it suits you.

332
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,240
Get about your regular job.

333
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,240
Working for a lousy government paycheck and stop wasting all your free time.

334
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,240
Hacking away on the golf court.

335
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
He knows.

336
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,240
Go get your home boy.

337
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,240
Richard.

338
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,240
And go see snakes on a plate.

339
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,240
I will.

340
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,240
In accordance with Mr. Jackson's urgent warnings.

341
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:36,240
The Vice President, Dick Cheney and I plan to investigate the serious threat at the

342
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,240
APM show tonight at the Regal Cinema's multiplex.

343
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,240
I hope all Americans will join me in thanking Samuel Jackson for his fourth rat attention

344
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,240
to our nation's air security.

345
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,240
Thank you for listening and God bless you.

346
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,240
For a complete archive of the President's weekly addresses.

347
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Visit weeklyradioaddress.com.

348
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,240
Whoever came up with that was the original was that for the mini I think it was.

349
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,240
We get the personalized custom phone call and you fill out a couple of things.

350
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,240
So the variables are all read by the actor.

351
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,240
I mean, that that that that Samuel Jackson stuff.

352
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,240
I mean, it was circulating the net for weeks.

353
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
It was very good.

354
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
It was well done.

355
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,240
Excellent.

356
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
Excellent promotion.

357
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
But then.

358
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,240
But then they have the President respond to it.

359
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,240
Yeah, that way.

360
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,240
That surprised me a bit.

361
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,240
Hey Adam, David, that guitar man from Central Park in New York City.

362
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,240
I was listening to the source code the other day and I heard you mentioned that when you get to New York,

363
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,240
you'd love to hang.

364
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,240
Just, you know, let me know.

365
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Man, let me know when you get to town and we'll definitely love to meet you.

366
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,240
I'd love to talk to you about stuff.

367
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,240
This is by the way in the background.

368
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,240
It's just a new song I'm working on.

369
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,240
And if you thought you had something to say about old exon, you know what?

370
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,240
You play this track.

371
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,240
Maybe I'll send it to you today.

372
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,240
You play this rough of this new track.

373
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,240
It's called the Religion Song.

374
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,240
And you just ask for people's opinion.

375
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,240
You'll have a whole damn show.

376
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,240
Anyway, the main reason for this shout is,

377
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,240
is that you know I've been doing this podcast called I Love the Company.

378
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,240
I'm coming up on show number 100 should be this week because I do when every single week day.

379
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
I'm going to do it Friday.

380
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,240
And the main purpose of the show is to do kind of what you started.

381
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,240
You know, find unsigned independent singer songwriters, artists, you know,

382
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,240
who people would never hear otherwise.

383
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,240
And I play him here in New York City.

384
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,240
The difference between my podcast and others that just play songs and rotation

385
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,240
is that there's a real network here at I Love the Company.

386
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,240
In other words, it's kind of a six degrees of separation thing.

387
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,240
You know, my guitar player Roger Bartlett played with Jimmy Buffett for years

388
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,240
and I work with Scott Burrow who's Eric Clapton's friend.

389
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,240
And the drummer on my last album played with Hall and Oats.

390
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,240
You know, that kind of thing.

391
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,240
And so it's kind of this kind of an extended kind of network kind of thing.

392
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,240
But here's the thing.

393
00:19:53,240 --> 00:20:00,240
Since you started the Podsafe network, I'm finding really, really, really wonderful artists.

394
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,240
And when I play them on my podcast,

395
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,240
they've got an open invitation to let me know when they're coming through New York.

396
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,240
And I make them a guest at one of my gigs.

397
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
So far, Cassandra Kubinsky.

398
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,240
She's on the Podsafe network and she's been out three times

399
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
to Central Park.

400
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,240
There's a woman named Megan Palmer that I discovered never met her.

401
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,240
But I loved her stuff on the Podsafe network and she's coming in from Ohio.

402
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,240
So she's coming out next weekend to play in front of a few thousand people of my audience.

403
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,240
And they're going to love her.

404
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,240
So it's that kind of thing.

405
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,240
Would you get the word out there that if there are New York based artists

406
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,240
because I'm not here from anybody from New York.

407
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,240
All right.

408
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,240
Tell them to give me a shout and send me an MP3.

409
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,240
And you, my friend, when you get to New York, let's hang.

410
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,240
Dude, thank you so much.

411
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,240
And you know I will definitely look you up when I come to New York.

412
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,240
He's that guitar man.

413
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,240
That guitar man.com David Epolyto.

414
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,240
He's the guy who you see playing in Central Park.

415
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,240
You know, that was such a great piece of feedback.

416
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,240
Except for the hall notes reference,

417
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,240
you know, that just that was a little too freaky for me.

418
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
All right.

419
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,240
I'm all four, man.

420
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
If I just play one song and that'll give me a whole show,

421
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
then give me your opinion.

422
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,240
I heard about a man who could split the moon

423
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
and even get a wolf to talk.

424
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,240
Then I heard about a man jumping out of a boat

425
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,240
because he thought he'd like to take a walk.

426
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,240
Then I heard about a man who said he hadn't his hand.

427
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,240
The deed to the promised land.

428
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,240
He said take out your sword in the name of the Lord

429
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,240
and kill your brother for a pile of sand.

430
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,240
Some say there's a big king watching it all,

431
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,240
but to me he sounds pretty unfair.

432
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,240
Turned in rivers to blood.

433
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
Then create an afloat.

434
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,240
Now I ain't saying because I wasn't there.

435
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,240
Kind of absurd to be taken the word.

436
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,240
Of another that I don't know well.

437
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:59,240
And it seems to me that a king that mean can't be big enough to help.

438
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,240
Now we got late night pictures on TV.

439
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,240
Mothers make a baby hose.

440
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,240
Born again to celebrities.

441
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,240
Rabbis on your radios.

442
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,240
Each one swears they heard the word.

443
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,240
Assured they got it right.

444
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,240
They say be the call of building another wall.

445
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,240
Get them all another reason to fight.

446
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,240
Now when he born me to get a nice clean slate,

447
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,240
but we don't waste any time.

448
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,240
We tell them follow the rules.

449
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,240
In the churches and the schools.

450
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,240
At the temple and the mosque and shrine.

451
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,240
We tell them scary tales and fairy tales.

452
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,240
A kiss common sense fair well.

453
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Don't tell them all that a god that small can't be big enough to help.

454
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,240
Now we got late night pictures on TV.

455
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,240
Mothers make a baby hose.

456
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,240
Born again celebrities.

457
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,240
The rabbis on your radios.

458
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,240
Each one swears they heard the word.

459
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
Assured they got it right.

460
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,240
They say be the call of building another damn wall.

461
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,240
Get them all another reason to fight.

462
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,240
Now I don't mind saying that I like prayer.

463
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,240
To what?

464
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,240
I'll never know.

465
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,240
I keep reaching out for something.

466
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,240
And not for nothing I'm content to let it go.

467
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,240
Because I've seen a little heaven in my time.

468
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,240
And at times I've been through hell.

469
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,240
And it got smaller enough to understand.

470
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,240
Never was big enough to help.

471
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,240
No when it got smaller enough to understand.

472
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,240
Can't be big enough to help.

473
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,240
Amen.

474
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,240
Like guitarman.com David Epolyto with religion.

475
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,240
Yeah, I got you figured out, man.

476
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,240
You are the Bob Dylan of our generation.

477
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,240
That's what it is.

478
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,240
You're going to.

479
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,240
Someone's going to finally catch on to what you're saying.

480
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,240
You watch.

481
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
You watch.

482
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,240
Let me see.

483
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,240
I was going to say crap.

484
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,240
I don't remember.

485
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,240
I want to welcome Brian no of the Frank Truth to the pod show team.

486
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
He was already a member of the family.

487
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,240
But he's really been helping out with the serious stuff on stars 102.

488
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,240
And we got some cool stuff coming your way.

489
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,240
I want to play one more thing for you here on the podcast Friday.

490
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,240
I played one of the three finalists for the Earthlink ad challenge,

491
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,240
which you can find at adchallenge.podshow.com.

492
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
And it was actually David Epolyto.

493
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,240
He was the first contender.

494
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,240
Which I believe we're announcing this week.

495
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,240
Big prize.

496
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,240
Two grand.

497
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,240
Your commercial goes into rotation.

498
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,240
And shit.

499
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,240
It's just kind of cool in it.

500
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,240
Here's finalist number two.

501
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,240
Is your computer a hacker magnet?

502
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:01,240
It won't be anymore because Earthlink is here to save the day.

503
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,240
With downloads faster than speeding bullets.

504
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,240
And firewall that is more powerful than a locomotive.

505
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,240
It has an anti-virus system that cleanses your PC with the click of a mouse.

506
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,240
It's a player.

507
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,240
It's a plane.

508
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,240
It's Earthlink.

509
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,240
Perfect.

510
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,240
Internet from outer space.

511
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,240
It linked to Earth.

512
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,240
The powers and abilities far greater than those of normal high speed.

513
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,240
And prices so low that it will blow you out of this world.

514
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,240
So make the right decision and turn to Earthlink as your internet provided.

515
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,240

David Epolyto used some of his music.

520
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,240
But I'm sure we can clear that.

521
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,240
No problem.

522
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,240
I'm sure Michael will be cool about it.

523
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,240
But you're going to have to give up someone at down.

524
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,240

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,240
