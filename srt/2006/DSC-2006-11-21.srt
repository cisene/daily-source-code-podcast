00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,760
Exactly

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,760
Not with the you joke

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,760
Kiss my ring. I've got a big jump

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,200

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,320
$16 million worth of airplane strapped my ass

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Then the next generation radio content in my ears

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I like to think I'm flying into the shirt

16
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,520
I

17
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Question everything

18
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,800
Everything is wrong by definition

19
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,120
Answer key in repetition

20
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,080
You don't know anything

21
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,120
It pauses me in hindsight

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,000
Frammonition my static heart is fish

23
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,360
I bitter harmony

24
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,360
I know that it sounds very dumb before

25
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,680
I guess I've just expected more

26
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,960
The bigger ball with one

27
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
Now stillness all is done

28
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,440
But make him plan some real time

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But we're on the burn economy

30
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,720
When I close my eyes

31
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
You always disappear

32
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,480
It's not like me to shave and say I'm sorry

33
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,240
Where's my finish line

34
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:03,240
It's never been down here and I feel waiting for a back lift story

35
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:20,520
The world will wait for me

36
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,760
So I thought when I was feeling upset

37
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,080
But I was so many young and stupid

38
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,280
There has happened

39
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,120
Others will be placed

40
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,120
I know what I was

41
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,720
But that points to nothing

42
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
When I close my eyes

43
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,880
I always disappear

44
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,560
It's not like me to shave and say I'm sorry

45
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,560
Where's my finish line

46
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,880
It's never been down here

47
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,320
And I've been waiting for a back lift story

48
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,360
When I close my eyes

49
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,880
You always disappear

50
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,640
It's not like me to shave and say I'm sorry

51
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,840
There's no way

52
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,240
So when I close my eyes

53
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,480
Just disappear

54
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,880
You always disappear

55
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,480
It's not like me to shave and say I'm sorry

56
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,680
There's no way

57
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,920
So when I close my eyes

58
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,160
Just disappear

59
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,200
You always disappear

60
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,160
It's not like me to shave and say I'm sorry

61
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,360
There's no way

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,480
There's no way

63
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,960
So when I close my eyes

64
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,480
Just disappear

65
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,640
It's not like me to shave and say I'm sorry

66
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,840
There's no way

67
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,960
So when I close my eyes

68
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,480
Just disappear

69
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:59,320
It's not like me to shave and say I'm sorry

70
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,280
It's

71
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,600

Getting the hang out with a lot of people

There's a couple of uh I got definitely to get together's planned

88
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,440
Near the end of the week looking forward to that a little bit of bonding with the

89
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,920
With my amigos and amigos out here

90
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,760
Hey big news that I have just not seen anyone report on I really really really don't understand why I'm not seeing more

91
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,440
More about this certainly online

92
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,560
Clear channel has agreed to be acquired

93
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,600
The buyout is going to be completed

94
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,760
18.7 billion dollars let me just go to the

95
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,400
I'll crap I hate it when I do that I have all my notes in google note pad and if you click on a link there

96
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,120
It doesn't pop open a new tab or a new window

97
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Sox anyway

98
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,760
Here we go clear channel communications the owner of so this is from

99
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,160
New York business.com

100
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,440
The owner of seven local radio stations said Thursday it is agreed to be acquired for about

101
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:51,240
$18.7 billion by group of investors led by Thomas H. Lee partners and bane capital partners now remember

102
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,520
Whenever an industry is on its last legs there's only one thing it can do it's

103
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,840
Consolidate so that's what clear channel was it it consolidated thousands of radio stations

104
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,080
But also outdoor venues and all kinds of

105
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:12,040
Related businesses and then there's only one thing way to go after that that's exactly what this is the company will be taken private

106
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,360
It's a management buyout

107
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,400
You know this is very similar to barbarians at the gate. You know KKR did with RGR in the bisco

108
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,040
That usually fucks companies up

109
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,280
I hate to say it for all the folks who are working at tier clear channel related companies

110
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,600
But that means that certainly for the next year there's gonna be a lot of turmoil in radio people are gonna be

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,560
Looking for well looking out for themselves of course

112
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,400
I don't know what they had like 40,000 employees in total

113
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,480
So when a new company comes in a management buyout like that what they do typically is they

114
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:51,000
Trim everything down get rid of the quote excess fat which is usually comes in the form of people

115
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,000
And then they they start you know chopping it up into bits

116
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,200
So I think this is the time we really need to strike my friends

117
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,520
It's strike hard. There's so many podcasts out there

118
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
Some are good in some are

119
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:14,520
This custodian. Oh, they're not that bad. Oh, not take the one called dancing with elephants for example. It's family safe

120
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:21,720
I told you join Greg Tanya Nikolai and Caleb. Wow find them at dancing with elephants.com and join the fun

121
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Okay, we'll see you later. Bye. Bye

122
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,560
Yesterday got a kind of a weird phone call on the voicemail

123
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,520
Apparently from someone who knows jazell jazell. It was been calling me up and

124
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,560
chatting me up to say the least

125
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,640
Let me just play that again. So so we can remind each other of this

126
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,080
I don't know who this is but stop fucking calling jazell ant hole

127
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,920
I got a lot of people saying hey, what's going on with that? Okay. I got an email

128
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,520
From jazell honey. I heard your show today

129
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,440
Want to say I'm so sorry for so lots of those sorry for that message in your comment line

130
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,600
I am so embarrassed that was Nick who's a complete jerk and isn't anything I really want to talk about but he doesn't control my life

131
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,120
A friend of mine says I said there is a train that goes from San Diego to San Francisco if that's true

132
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,280
I'm gonna come up there on Wednesday because I don't want you to be all alone for Thanksgiving

133
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,880
And then she says here's something to think of me by and she sent me a picture

134
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,200
Excuse me the old man and me can barely handle this is like a

135
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,720
Very nice belly button picture

136
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:46,120
Love jazell PS I would tell you to call me, but I don't think it's safe for me to use my phone for a couple of days until I get a new one

137
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:52,600
PPS I looked it up fun. Oh god. I looked it up on the internet. I know where the pod show offices, so I'll just meet you there

138
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,560
jazell. I don't know this is such a good idea

139
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,160
Oh, sorry, it's way too early for me. You know

140
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,680
Maybe we should get to know each other a little bit before you actually come on over here

141
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:17,880
Yeah, I'm just over current you tell us near just responding to a comment made by the guy from spine grayio.com

142
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,920
I think that's at 496 I'm a little bit behind at the moment

143
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,320
You sort of that was zoom

144
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
And he was saying that's

145
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,760
Well, you know if you could set a windows media play just monitor a directory and if you download your podcast as an app

146
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:38,600
Then it will upload them and that's all well and good and that's better than the iPod does because you need

147
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,920
I actually want to get your podcast and it's a point that windows media play can do that

148
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:49,880
But unfortunately windows media play is not supported on the zoom the only software that the zoom supports the stuff that comes with the player

149
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,920
Most of our so confident in their previous

150
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
MP3 products that they're not supporting

151
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,800
Those previous products including the thing that's bundled in every copy windows on the using

152
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,200
So there's only pretty much a podcast free zone at the moment

153
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
Just so I see that back to you. Thanks a lot, bye

154
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,800
Yeah, I appreciate it lots of people and I haven't really talked about the zoom that that much

155
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,520
Obviously because out of the box it doesn't really understand what to do with podcast and unless you

156
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,680
There is a way of course to drag an MP3 file into it somehow. I haven't seen one of these

157
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,960
I have my hands kind of have been itching to check on out

158
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,840
But most of what I've heard is oh, you know, they don't support podcasting

159
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,640
And of course already the hacks are appearing on the scene. This came in this morning

160
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,640
Yeah, and I'm this is a shoes calling from Chicago

161
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,360
You were talking about

162
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,480
All of a sudden you were talking to soon and that's how you need software

163
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,160
or

164
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,760
And that having software to play

165
00:12:51,080 --> 00:13:00,040
podcast or to get podcasts while I found out there's a program called our website that's called feed your soon

166
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,920
All-one word that call of course, feed your soon that come off is a program that accompanies the soon player

167
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,640
And let's you download

168
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:19,800
Podcast to the zoom so you can play them and it seems to have some next features and hey, maybe there's a solution that you guys might want to be aware of

169
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,520
You know, it's interesting. So I'm looking at this feed your zoom dot com look at looking at the page and

170
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,520
It's just like iTunes

171
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,960
Which of course, you know, on the one hand it's good because it looks like it can actually

172
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,400
Subscribe you to podcasts and automatically download audio and video onto your zoom device

173
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,400
Of course, this is yet another piece of software you need to manage

174
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,680
To use to manage content to get it onto the device

175
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,280
You know, I think that there's a really a hugely missed opportunity here

176
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:58,680
You know, what's happening with these hardware manufacturers is they they market these MP3 players and video players and they market it with you know

177
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,680
Essentially the only thing the consumer

178
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,160
Cares about or at least I do as a consumer. You know, well, what content can I get with it?

179
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,720
It's just like VHS and beta max, you know, who was buying beta maxes

180
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,360
Well people who didn't want any content

181
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,360
You know video stores sprung up and then of course everyone went to VHS because

182
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,440
VHS had all the actually the porn I guess in the early days and

183
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,960
All of these devices all these portable media devices are all being marketed as music machines

184
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,480
I really believe that if you put a cheap machine out there in the marketplace

185
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,840
But marketed it

186
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,680
As a podcast receiver a pod catcher or

187
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
Something along those lines I

188
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:47,240
You know, or just said hey you want some great fucking alternative content to your radio. It's on this device

189
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,800
Excuse me since I was blind on folders and all that stuff

190
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,120
So I think that the first you know, there's got to be someone out there who can put a

191
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:05,080
$99 device in the marketplace. Maybe we do it without audio first just to do it without video just do it with audio

192
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,560
And and you know market it with look at all these these great shows you can get on this device

193
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,800
I think that you know, I think that that would work

194
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:21,800
And of course the zoom will support pod casting absolutely you know that it's it's gonna be in the next step from where revision or whatever

195
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,880
So I think that's the missed opportunity here

196
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,320
And it's very very hard to compete with something as massive as as iTunes in the iPod

197
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,880
Anyway, keep an eye on it. So yesterday I told you that I was receiving lots of emails and audio feedbacks about

198
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,360
Being discussed on this week in tech episode

199
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,320
What is it?

200
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:50,280
207-7-H whatever that means. That's the identifier here on the file and and I listen to it

201
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
I was pretty amazed first of all about

202
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
the misinformation

203
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,880
being the disseminated through the show

204
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:06,040
But also the invitation was quite interesting. Please listen in with me to this week in tech

205
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,480
Leola port

206
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,920
Jonsi de Vorak, well I'm a big fan of and I've known for a long or I met a long long time ago

207
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,880
And I'm a big fan of what he does and then

208
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:26,120
Forget the guys name he interviewed me at podcast con uk on Saturday and London and essentially he interviewed me and then

209
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,120
Went right on to to he is a I guess a semi regular on Twitter

210
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,720
And he had the following to say about me

211
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,760
So I was anyway at the grocery store, you know, and he leaves you know after you know

212
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,160
You should hold on a second. That's somehow it jumped back in in cast blaster

213
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,400
Let me see

214
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
He's Jonsi de Vorak talking about

215
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,040
Famous people and that of course is the impetus here to start talking about me

216
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,960
Ah, that's Leo talking some crap come on get to the

217
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:06,040
Somehow I had it set up exact the exact point set up in cast blaster and then it like jump back

218
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,720
I don't know if that has to do with the file size

219
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:15,320
This is that's how the real world feels about podcast usually a logging web 2.0 web 3.0

220
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,960
They don't care the whole world's going yeah, whatever

221
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,040
Yep, that's very depressing

222
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:29,160
All right, it's true you're right. What is the the other father of podcasting adzam curry yesterday?

223
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,840
What oh my god, this is amazing. Where did the man? Where'd you meet him?

224
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:41,160
Uh, podcast con uk. Oh really they had a podcast uk version of the portable media expert right in it with emphasis on the word con

225
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,680
All right, all right, that's a funny line

226
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:51,320
That was the in joke. Yes, so tell me about what happened to podcast? Well, he tensed up the apparently he's moved to England

227
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,560
Yeah, that's right. He was apparently how about I've been there for two years, dude

228
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,880
Belgium or somewhere and now he's back

229
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,520
Yeah, he's actually he tends up because is it hot show?

230
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:08,680
Yes, this guy is now pretending like he doesn't know who I am or or who pod show is he was all over me in podcast

231
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,720
I got to find out what this guy's name is because now he's like, oh, I'm going to talk shit about Adam

232
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,440
I think this company has his company has now got a sort of uk version, which is

233
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:25,000
BT pod show British telecom pod show who sort of bulls with concept. He is a man. He is a mad deal maker that man

234
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,360
I can't believe we turned up. He's got you know how much you just seen how much much venture funding he got for pod show

235
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,080
Half million oh it's over 15

236
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:39,880
Really no actually it's a over 23 15 million wiki pd says eight and a half minutes

237
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,720
Oh, it's behind the time. I got no, no, please whatever you do believe wiki pd

238
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,600
Okay, that shit's always right behind the times

239
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:52,520
I wanted to go in and edit that and put in the correct number and I got deleted because people said I was over inflating shit

240
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,840
But both numbers are ridiculous. Where is the show me the money?

241
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,760
Yeah, so what is so tell me he shows up in what you said he is he wearing an outfit

242
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,920
And I rate just pink jumper with pink sunglasses no this raining outside and we're the middle of grey London right now

243
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,160
Yeah hold on a second hold on a second dude first of all

244
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,920
These aren't pink sunglasses

245
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,680
He was sitting no more than 20 centimeters away from me

246
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,600
Their glasses and their rose colored glasses

247
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,760
I love watching in the world through rose colored glasses

248
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,040
You're totally misrepresenting that I was wearing sunglasses inside now

249
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:38,280
They were not sunglasses did completely wrong and then the jumpa as you call it is a sweater

250
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:45,160
Of course, it was pink and matched the glasses before I leave the house. I have two very stylish women

251
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,120
Who evaluate what I have on and then dress me up

252
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,960
I'm so sorry. I didn't know that you or the rest of the podcast community were the

253
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,320
Fashion icons. I thought you were no got the pink sunglasses take the boy out of MTV

254
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,120
But you can't take the TV out of the boy. That's all I can say right and he was really interesting even though he's like

255
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,280
What he's like 63 now oh fuck you Leo dude

256
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
You know so many people

257
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,960
I got really I could start it very early. I was on television when I was 19. I'm only 42

258
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:23,400
Please don't make me feel any worse than I already do about that Leo. This took at the long blonde hair in the pink jumper

259
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,040
And he's out in the corner. It's basically just chatting to people who are coming up and looks like grandpa on one stir

260
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,880
He Leo. I know you're kidding about this, right?

261
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:45,720
He never happened to graceful aging gracefully. That's all I ask

262
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:52,840
I'm throwing some quick say what was it what he's what he was kind of like the bad boy in the corner. Is that what he was doing?

263
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,840
No, man

264
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:00,920
That was just feeling up the females yeah people were just like saying hello and he was throwing it

265
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,280
I think well the did you have to kiss his ring when he comes when you come up to him or man?

266
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,240
He has got quite a big ring. He does. I've kissed it. Well

267
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,440
Kissing you kissed not exactly kissing when anyone was here somewhere

268
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:21,240
Yeah, no punch line. He was just throwing crotes out like you know how thick was it was never going to be worth

269
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,280
Anything that it was just like a policy. You know what you want to know the sad thing and that dig stuff

270
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,840
You know that is so you are such a dickweed

271
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,840
You know, I thought you were a journalist. You know that is not what I said

272
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,080
You're taking my my words completely out of context

273
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,840
Who is this guy but when he get brain damage

274
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,920
No, because he has eight and a half million he knows

275
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,920
Well, yeah

276
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,920
digs never going to be worth anything

277
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,640
Kiss my ring. I've got a pink jumper

278
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:57,320
You show you don't like Adam I take it. No, I'm just teasing him. I don't know. He said he listed he said right

279
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,520
This is the best quote from him all day. I said I slice me at him. I actually do a podcast

280
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,040
I'm on the as by a friend of my Lea La Poe. I do this week in tech. He said oh, yes

281
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:12,120
I know this week in tech. Oh, yeah. I know he said generally I all like do is I check the website to see if the

282
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,680
I'm not that late. Oh, interesting. Well, he's got what's up? He's a smart guy

283
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,280
Adam carries your biggest fan job

284
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,240
I'm not as big as fan, but you know, I met Devorac in the very early 90s

285
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,960
Maybe it was even maybe it was 80 maybe it was 1990

286
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,480
This outfit in California and at the time I had it, you know, I was just working at MTV for a couple of years

287
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,320
I had an agent in Los Angeles Marion Rosenberg very famous agent who

288
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,440
I think what I had gotten some kind of gig on a totally hidden video

289
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,960
Which was a Fox TV show and the executive producer of that a guy named Kevin Wendell

290
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,920
Who would I think actually help set up the Fox network of television stations

291
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,080
formerly known as the

292
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,280
Code hanger network

293
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
The wire code hanger network

294
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,320
He was brought into Cnet early on because it was a television project

295
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,560
It was going to be a television channel and it was going to be a tech oriented channel

296
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,920
On cable and

297
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,480
So I think it it came through Kevin Wendell and he had of course teamed up with the founders of Cnet

298
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,840
Shelby Bonnie and

299
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,840
Halsey minor

300
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,480
I'm sure there were other investors and they basically

301
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:35,160
Said you know, you know, they contracted me to come out and do a pilot and the pilot consisted of a number of different shows

302
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:40,200
There were basically creating a I think like a 12 hour block of Cnet programming and based upon that

303
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:49,640
They would go out and get get more venture funding and it was one of the most amazing trips of my life that that I've ever made because it was actually was it was life changing

304
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,560
Because I remember I'd never really been to San Francisco. I remember arriving at SFO and you know

305
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:01,320
Seeing like I'd never seen so many laptop bags in my life remember this is a 1990 or 91 very very early

306
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,200
And you know, there was a guy sitting over in the corner with his C++

307
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,080
Developers kit

308
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:15,480
Yeah, you know the the actual shrink wrap box under his arm. I'm like wow that this is and I was geek, you know, so I thought yeah

309
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,480
This could be kind of a place for me

310
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,040
You know what the real bummer is

311
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,120
God, this is a bummer. If you're listening to this on serious satellite stars 102

312
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,600
You got it down low the rest of the show with daily source code dot com to hear the rest of the story

313
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:38,680
Because there's some good as history in here when it comes to Silicon Valley so anyway you guys love to do that and I also have a shakes live recording

314
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,440
To anyway

315
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,720
They they didn't even have a website in fact

316
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,480
During that I think it was like a weekend where I

317
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,120
Where this was taking place it was a really cool set

318
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,160
You know lots of television professionals. So it was pretty fun to work with them

319
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,480
There was a co-host on the channel at the time Dr. Mae Gemison

320
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,360
astronaut

321
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,000
And she was extremely nice and there was a

322
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,360
And then there was kind of like a roundtable

323
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,880
program

324
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,800
For get what it was called but it was very much like the McGlockling group and John C. Devorex sat there with a number of other

325
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,880
um

326
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,360
Well, I guess you would call them pundits these days

327
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:31,800
In fact very much like what the Gilmore gang is only it was a video version and I was fantastic you know there was

328
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,600
John Perry Barlow I

329
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,600
Met him there and hung out with him

330
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:42,200
That's where I met Mark Cantor for the first time and I'll never forget you know three o'clock in the morning

331
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,840
Mark Cantor holding court and all these kids and myself included basically sitting around and

332
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,120
Spoken dope listening to stories of early Macintoshes and early

333
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:58,840
Just really the early Silicon Valley days of personal computing and it was it was just so enthralling

334
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:05,880
I'm like wow this is like a like hippie stuff out here for geeks and I have to admit I felt very very comfortable and very very much at home

335
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,120
I really don't think so no

336
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,920
Adam's a great guy and really what there would be no part you know he used to be a scene at in the early days and they got rid of him

337
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
For some oh

338
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,120
I hope that is not what Shelby and Halsey told you John C

339
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,080
Here's what here's what happened so I did the pilot which they paid me for and

340
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:35,480
You know before I did that we actually signed and agreement you know that said well, you know if everything gets picked up then we'll take you on for this amount of money

341
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,880
And it's like two million options or something like that options in C net

342
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,720
And as I said a minute ago, they they didn't have a website so actually while I was there that week and a registered

343
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,720
C net dot com for them and

344
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,080
I set up a email forwarding to their AOL

345
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,280
addresses because they had all they had was AOL

346
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,360
America online and American online didn't even have remember this was pre American online

347
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:09,400
Giving their users access to the internet remember those days when you could only use the AOL browser and

348
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,320
And they would only let you go to certain sites and it cashed everything for hours and all man how the good old days

349
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,200
And so you know I actually ran there their

350
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,200
Their email and their domain name registration for almost a year so after that weekend

351
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:32,040
You know a couple things happened. Oh, also I had to move to San Francisco to do it and you know that was one thing the

352
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,600
Petrition I definitely weren't really it wasn't the right moment for us to move to San Francisco

353
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,840
But also I felt that they had no vision, you know, I was I and I remember telling them there

354
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:47,480
Said you know, do you do please you know the future of what you're doing here is great the whole idea of a content

355
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,920
Network around technology is fantastic

356
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,800
But you've got to look further than a cable channel. You've got to look at what you can do with this stuff online

357
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:01,560
It's all gonna come it's happening and of course these guys just didn't have the vision because they couldn't even see the internet because they were on AOL

358
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:08,840
And so I I wasn't too sure. I was gonna take the gig to start with but then they did something really

359
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,200
I think it was really stupid

360
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,360
Oh, it certainly wasn't a nice thing to do. They got investment in based upon

361
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,960
I guess partially based upon the pilot and then they had to do like a reverse split and

362
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,720
What's the word I'm looking for right I never have to deal with this word

363
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,560
Oh

364
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,560
I'm spacing

365
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
I know the Dutch word

366
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,080
for Valtara

367
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,080
crap anyway

368
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,880
I had two million shares and then all of a sudden all that had to change and there was all this paperwork and

369
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,240
Delusion. Oh, thank you. I told you it never have to deal with that

370
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,160
And and everyone was deluding

371
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:03,480
So instead of you know taking this out of their own option pool or however else they were dealing with the money coming in and the shares being split up

372
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,880
They took it away from people they had you know promised a part two before that. It was just it was like fuck you

373
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,560
You know you guys got no vision and you clearly aren't entirely nice

374
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,960
So I'll just pass you know thank you very much

375
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:19,480
I had a good time but I'm not gonna take you up on the opportunity so they didn't get rid of me John C. Devorek

376
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,040
I did not get rid of me

377
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,400
God

378
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,920
But I'd like to know if that's what they told you in another way. He was quite the visionary

379
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,280
I mean when he was at MTV

380
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
He left and and started an ISP

381
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,840
I mean, I know here's a piece of sharp eye. I did not start an ISP

382
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:41,560
Leo God this how this is you got you know this is what happens whenever you listen to or listen to a

383
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:47,000
Show or read something that's about yourself you hear all these

384
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:53,560
Incredible inconsistencies untruths and mistakes and you've got to question

385
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:59,960
The next thing you're listening to or reading which you don't know that much about you've got a question if it's ever's a writer not

386
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,440
No, I did not start an ISP

387
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,760
I started a company called on-ramp

388
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:11,880
Now there was an ISP called on-ramp in Texas at the time but it was definitely two different types of companies

389
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:19,960
I started a really what was it turned out to be an interactive advertising agency. We were building websites. You know first client was

390
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:27,560
What do we have? We built planet reboc.com but wiser dot com tampax dot com the website

391
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,560
You'll visit more than once a month

392
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,600
We built continental airlines flightcontinental dot com

393
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,440
You know that's what I was doing and yes, I did leave MTV. I quit on the air and said

394
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,280
I think the internet's the place to be we should go find that piece of video someone has it somewhere

395
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,880
It was right after the number one of the top 20 countdown. I remember it was loser by back

396
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,400
Which I thought was just so interesting but I'm surprised you know I think I remember I was in Europe

397
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:57,000
In the late 90s before the dot com bus and I was reading one of these I think it was a Dutch paper

398
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,400
Talking about him how he's worth a hundred million

399
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,280
Devorac can read Dutch

400
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,640
Dollars and he's very good at promoting himself and

401
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,000
I couldn't figure out what yeah, I think and wow, you know because he owned all this stuff and then didn't I don't know what happened

402
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,880
And then next thing you know he's been doing a bunch of other stuff and so I I think he's he's

403
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,760
Become a mysterious person and so far as what is what he's worth what money is

404
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,640
I got you know what we want to keep it that way John C. Devorac

405
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,080
I want you to be always thinking what's courty up to what's he doing behind my back?

406
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:39,960
What I've got $20 right here for you Adam U.S. cash on the table if you want to be on Twitter just come on by

408
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,840
I bet he's heard of Skype

409
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:56,200
Yeah, he'd be fun to talk so was podcast content fun of concast UK con anyway, so any goes on and on now I'll put a link in the show notes to the show

410
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,680
So I emailed Leo. I said dude 20 bucks

411
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,200
Stick you know shut that up your ass. Of course. I'll come on only to do with ass

412
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,200
You've never asked me to be on the show, but I'll only do it if John C. Devorac is on

413
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:14,440
So he wants me to do it Sunday, but I'm I think I'm flying back Saturday and one and you know

414
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,280
I want to arrive until Sunday late and warning and

415

I'll be jet lag and I want to be really fresh when I talk to these guys and get that English guy on too

416
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,200
That's the so-called journalist will you please?

417
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,680

It's next on the chinkled daylight

00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,240
Hello

00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:04,240
What can you do with your man who won't be able to change?

430
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,240
I swear, but I swear, but now they're blue.

431
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,240
All the trippin' payin' for me, use cock and disappear.

432
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:17,240
And all I seem to think about is you, thickening it in daylight.

433
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

434
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,240

437
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,240
I can't talk to him because he's dumb.

438
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,240

The shakes from podcast con UK

443
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,240
I think I need a little bit of daylight

444
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,240
Yeah, those guys are great

445
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,240
Fantastic links in the show notes, of course

446
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,240
DailySourceCode.com

447
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,240
There was one more thing that I didn't get to play yesterday

448
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,240
That was just so funny because it's since we've been talking about history here

449
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,240
And the more I think about that guy who passed himself off as a journalist

450
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,240
And then, you know, clearly trying to, you know,

451
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,240
Bake entertainment out of our encounter

452
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,240
Behind my back with, you know, just fuck you

453
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,240
Get that guy on, okay?

454
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,240
When I come on the show

455
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,240
I gotta talk to him too

456
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,240
All right, this is something I didn't get around to yesterday

457
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,240
But I really liked because it is a piece of history

458
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,240
That's, that's pretty funny

459
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,240
Anyway, I just thought I'd send a little gift to you

460
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:17,240
This is a little something I stumbled across

461
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,240
I'm getting ready to head home for Thanksgiving

462
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,240
And I just wanted to take a few things to listen to

463
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,240
On the way, you know, just in case I get bored with the family

464
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,240
But anyway, I was stumbling, I stumbled across this on a website called

465
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,240
MP3airtracks.com

466
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,240
That's Mike Papa, numero3airtracks.com

467
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,240
It's from KQLZ in Los Angeles

468
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,240
And the morning guy, Michael's got Shannon

469
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,240
I, you might know, you might not, I don't know

470
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,240
But just take a listen as we go back to 1980

471
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,240
And a good morning to Adam Curry

472
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,240
Just getting up as one of him at his lovely wife

473
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,240
For sure, she was in town for the TJ Martell

474
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,240
Celebrity softball game

475
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,240
He's telling me a funny story that happened Saturday

476
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,240
Tommy Lee and the Molly crew is kind of like

477
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,240
Running his mouth, Jacket is yours

478
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,240
Up there with his softball bed

479
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,240
Now that first time up

480
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,240
Strikes out, you know, hard as a strike out in softball

481
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,240
Second time up Tommy Lee strikes out again

482
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,240
The third time he pops it up into foul territory

483
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,240
And one of the L.A. kings, I don't know which one

484
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,240
It wasn't grassky, one of the L.A. kings runs over

485
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,240
And catches Tommy Lee's hit

486
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,240
Behind his back

487
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,240
Any free

488
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,240
It threw his bat down, he started

489
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
I'm gonna read

490
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,240
KQLZ Los Angeles

491
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,240
Pirate radio

492
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,240
All right, that wasn't Tommy Lee

493
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,240
It was Vince Neale

494
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,240
He was one of the crew, it was Vince Neale

495
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,240
Popped out in softball time

496
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,240
Sorry Tommy

497
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,240
The light grew anyway

498
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,240
Nice travel back in time

499
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,240
Is it just weird we need a little more played echo

500
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,240
And radio these days

501
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,240
That'll solve the problem

502
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,240
Not breaking up clear channel

503
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,240
He's played echo

504
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,240
It's all about the echo

505
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,240
But anyway again, congratulations

506
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,240
Five hundred Charlie's

507
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,240
You keep making them

508
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,240
Keep commenting on them, okay?

509
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,240
All right, yeah, thank you

510
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,240
Yes, when he says played echo

511
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,240
He's talking about about this effect

512
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,240
Michael Scott Shannon, never bother

513
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,240
Oh man

514
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,240
Yeah, that was Pirate radio

515
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,240
Actually, that was another gig

516
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,240
I had just been an MTV for like two years

517
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,240
And I was asked to come out to work with the Scott Shannon on Pirate radio

518
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,240
Was a KQLD

519
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
Something like that

520
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,240
KQX, I don't know whatever, Pirate radio

521
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,240
103.5 FM in Los Angeles

522
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,240
I'm glad I didn't do it

523
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,240
Because the station didn't last very long

524
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,240
It's you know Scott Shannon who has built some very successful radio stations

525
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,240
That was not one of them

526
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,240
Yeah

527
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,240
But it's not it didn't just sound like a podcast, man

528
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,240
With all the play echo

529
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,240
Oh

530
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,240
Yeah, that was a good day, man

531
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,240
That was the time we were out there

532
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,240
It was indeed not Tommy Lee was Vince Neil

533
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,240
But it was the same softball

534
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,240
We had these annual softball games

535
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,240
And Sam Kinniston was still alive, man

536
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,240
That was pretty wild

537
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,240
He drives what up under the diamond

538
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
And his white rolls Royce with all kinds of chicks

539
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,240
It was like falling out

540
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,240
I

541
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,240
Yeah

542
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,240
What was I going to say?

543
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,240
I was something really important

544
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,240
People are escaping me already

545
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,240
I got to go

546
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,240
Oh yeah, I did want to mention that we've got a new in the attic coming up

547
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,240
That's the Pete Townsend Rachel Fuller Show

548
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,240

Okay

557
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,240
I don't understand that

558
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,240
So there's a new one

559
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,240

560
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,240
But I just want you to listen to this

561
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,240

He's he's awesome

563
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,240
He just listened to the intro for a second here

564
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,240
You're right

565
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,240
So I'm Rachel Fuller

566
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,240

Wait, I want to let me get into the

The thing where Pete stars hold on

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,240
I'd love that song by the way

00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,240
That's their opening

What?

584
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,240
It's the wrong colour

585
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,240
It's the wrong colour

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,240
Let me pray
