Delta Sierra Charlie 453.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I need more intros, send me intros.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm a Mac, and I'm a PC.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So are you ready to get started?

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Nope, I've got a lot to do.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Got to get this trial software deleted, update software, get some anti-virus.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, sounds like you've got a lot to do, so I'm just going to get started.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What? What are you going to do?

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Go play some games that came out in 1998.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What did you say, bitch?

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You heard me?

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Now you're getting cut.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass,

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
then the next generation radio content in my ears.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
She was best studying abroad.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
He was on tour.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Playing in another dime.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
They partyed hard and they partyed wings.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
A little north of the sand.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He dreamed about her in so many ways.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
She dreamed about her in French.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, she knows what to do with my call.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
She knows how to make him feel.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That is the one.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He's his mother son, not like anyone.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He just needs time to heal.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
They met in New York a few months later.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He was still living alone.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Hugging the ball and masturbating.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Never answered his phone.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That first date was a movie together.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Outside it Brian Pock.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Well, the spirit I'm saying, Louis,

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
just went on for a vlog.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Till they drank wine.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Until they saw his cars.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well, she knows what to do with my call.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
She knows how to make him feel.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That is the one.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He's his mother son, not like anyone.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He just needs time to heal.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:43,000
They finally hooked up for the first time.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The night before the Fourth of July.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He felt so awkward saying goodbye to the girl who just changed his life.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Now my friend, they are in separate ball.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
She even gets that boy to go to the gym.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Now if you don't think that's love, you must be cynical.

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, maybe man, you're just dreaming in friends.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah, because she knows what to do with my call.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
She knows how to make him feel.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That is the one.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He's his mother son, not like anyone.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He just needs time to heal.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh, she knows what to do with my call.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
She knows how to make him feel.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That is the one.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He's his mother son, not like anyone.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He just needs time to heal.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah, he's the one.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He's his mother son, not like anyone.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He just needs time to heal.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Well, that's right.

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He just needs time to heal.

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh, it's been too long to play that one.

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Can he butchers what to do with Michael from the pod save music network, my viola?

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Add it again.

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Hey, everybody.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
How you doing?

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's the daily source code episode 453 coming to you from the affluent suburb of Surrey

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
known as Gilford.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's the curry cottage.

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Please send me more openings.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's see.

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I've been really enjoying these intros you've been sending me to the show.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I've left.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I've got four, five, four.

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I've got five, five, one.

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And I've got six, six, six.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Please.

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Somebody fill in the gaps for me, will ya?

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's one of those days.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's one of those days when kind of nothing's going on.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And when I'm thinking, what the heck am I going to do on the show today?

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
There she is.

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
My pillar.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Not below.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
My pillar.

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
She's there to save my ass.

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What do I do?

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Adam, hey, it's Amy Mack.

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This is day five and today we're doing lunches.

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Lunches.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Can you believe we've been at this for five weeks?

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah.

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This has got to be hot by now.

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I can't wait to show you.

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I can't wait to show you.

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
All right.

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Let's get started.

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
All right.

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What are we doing?

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You're going to start with feet shoulder with a pair.

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let's take a big step forward with your right leg.

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay.

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Now pause and then bend the right knee and have your body moved straight down.

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Oh, I know.

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And like always, you don't want your front knee to come over your toes.

116
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay.

117
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Your left knee should be about two inches from the ground.

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Oh.

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Come back up and bring that right leg back to the center.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So you're in your beginning stand.

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It wasn't quite two inches.

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Good.

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Now the left.

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Left.

125
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Okay.

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Big step.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You're long legs.

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So the step she covers from ground.

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes.

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Pause.

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Now straight down.

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You should really feel this in your back leg and your foot.

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay.

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Okay.

136
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Come back to center.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Great.

138
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Now back to the other side.

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You have seven more to do on each side.

140
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Why ask seven on each side?

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Don't forget to squeeze your stomach and breathe.

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
We don't want you to become like a head of, you know.

143
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This exercise is already a lower body exercise.

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It focuses on the butt, thigh as an abs.

145
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Can you feel it?

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes.

147
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Good.

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The pause allows you to align yourself so that you keep proper form when doing the lunge.

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Keeping the front knee from coming over the toe is really important and protect in your knee.

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And maximizing the benefits of the exercise.

153
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
As you mentioned last week, Adam, we're going to make exercise a separate feed.

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah.

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We'll be located at AsurSize.com.

156
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So for now, it's a working progress.

157
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But we're getting there.

158
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So stay tuned.

159
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
All right.

160
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I think that's it.

161
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Fabulous job is always more a weekend and have a great birthday.

162
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Until next time.

163
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
AsurSize.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Thank you.

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Thank you Amy Mack.

166
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Seven on your side.

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I feel, I don't know, man.

168
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't know if it's helping at all.

169
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It reminds me of fencing.

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
We used to lunge all the time.

171
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You know, I was, I was like a third national champion in the Netherlands when I was,

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I don't know, 15 or something like that.

173
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Fencing.

174
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah.

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You know, sounds kind of faggy.

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I've got to catch my breath and I've got to lay off the splits.

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Hey, Adam, kneel here from the Podsafe Revolution.

178
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Bring you your weekly football Friday Podsafe tune.

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
This week I'm recommending a track called Slow Burn by Sacramento's seventh standard.

180
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Now, they're not up on the PMN yet.

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But if you know me, these guys are coming soon.

182
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Now, remember way back in May.

183
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I was creating a Podsafe marathon playlist.

184
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That marathon went well until the end when I literally crawled to the finish line.

185
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I finished in three hours and 30 minutes, which isn't bad, but now I'm out to beat that time.

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So I'll be running in the Prince Edward County marathon on October 1st here in Ontario, Canada.

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And for that occasion, I'm once again building an open-source Podsafe marathon playlist.

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Now, I've just released Episode 17 of the Podsafe Revolution, which is a 76 minute mix tape of what we have so far.

189
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So anyone out there who is pounding the pavement with an iPod plugged into their brain,

190
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
training for an event, or for those of you who just want to check out what this whole revolution is about.

191
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Check it out at the PodsafeRevolution.podshow.com.

192
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Thanks to the power of Pods Show Plus.

193
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You can just add comments to suggest songs for the playlist, or you can email them to podsafeRevolutionatgmail.com.

194
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Now, for those of you about to run, I salute you.

195
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And Adam, grab your cowbell.

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
This song needs it.

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Until next week, I'm wishing you a kick-ass food by Friday.

198
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Cheers, man.

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Of course, I already played slow burn.

200
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So I feel kind of stupid now for playing that.

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But I did want to get him his word out about the Podsafe mix marathon mix tape.

202
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Let's see, I got a pretty cool email yesterday from Kevin.

203
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
First person show.net.

204
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
He says, always looking, always looking for stuff for you, for audio, for the daily source code.

205
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
This is, and of course, I'll put a link in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

206
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This is a guy taking on a telemarketer.

207
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Now, I have to say, in the United Kingdom, I'm amazed at how many telemarketers call.

208
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And by the way, it's like my bank, usually.

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You know, it's Barclays Bank.

210
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And they're always like, we want to review your account.

211
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I said, if you call me one more time, I'm going to review the account.

212
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Of course, I didn't record that.

213
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But it's just always around 830 between 8 and 9 o'clock.

214
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's just calling, and calling, of course, in the States, that's supposed to have diminished

215
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
because of this, you know, never call database that was set up.

216
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I wonder if it actually has diminished if telemarketing has slowed down at all in the US.

217
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But this guy, and I think he's from the UK, he kind of turns the tables on a telemarketer.

218
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And I really liked it, and I think I will use this tactic.

219
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Check it out.

220
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That is okay, sir.

221
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
One is a little bit more about what you're asking.

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Well, I am calling you on a APT.

223
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And today, we have a special offer of a free mobile phone just for you.

224
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You're not going to have to do the work together.

225
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Well, sir, in order to get it, you must give us details about yourself.

226
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What else can you tell me about this offer?

227
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm definitely really interested at a really, much a little bit more.

228
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Well, sir, what we need to do is firstly get information from you.

229
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So that we can tell you more.

230
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You come and see exactly.

231
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Well, sir, if you let us know.

232
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Sorry about that.

233
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Thank you, sir.

234
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
No problem, sir.

235
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That's a really nice touch.

236
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You're doing really, it was really ghastly like death cough.

237
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That works.

238
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I think if you give me the morning information, what I really feel about this offer.

239
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm definitely really interested at a really, much a little bit more.

240
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Well, sir, I am trying to be telling you some more.

241
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Please, please, to be letting this in, sir.

242
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Well, it's what I'm having with you, exactly.

243
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But sir, I am telling you how to work.

244
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You know, sir.

245
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Sorry about that.

246
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Sorry about that.

247
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Sorry about that.

248
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Sorry about that.

249
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Sorry about that.

250
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Sorry about that.

251
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Sorry about that.

252
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Sorry about that.

253
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You sound like you are sick, sir.

254
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Maybe you do not like this offer.

255
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm definitely really interested at a really, much a little bit more.

256
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I am not sure I can tell you anything more, sir.

257
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
People who are not letting me see me.

258
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And you keep saying the same thing over and over again.

259
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm not worth it.

260
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
No, I cannot.

261
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Ah.

262
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Haha.

263
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No, I cannot.

264
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I cannot tell you now.

265
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Fantastic.

266
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm going to do that next time.

267
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Hey, I'm really interested in your offer.

268
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Can you tell me a bit more?

269
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And that way, we have to get some of your details.

270
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
No, you tell me first.

271
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Tell me a bit more about the offer.

272
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I like it a lot.

273
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Sorry about the shitty quality, but I think you got the gist.

274
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
One, two, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven.

275
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Again.

276
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
One, two, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven.

277
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
If you want to call in to the Charlie Voice Mail Feedback number.

278
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's one, two, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven.

279
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Put a plus and fun of that.

280
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
If you're entering this into a speed dial into your memory on your mobile phone.

281
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So you can use it worldwide.

282
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
In the UK, if you want to call our London number,

283
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
02076813753.

284
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Hello, Adam.

285
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Hey, it's Martin Gd.

286
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I have so to get point to get in the message.

287
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah, I was listening again to the Charlie and you're done.

288
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Remember with your daughter?

289
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I can synthesize and empathize.

290
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
One of them.

291
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm a definitely self.

292
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I look at 16 year old daughter.

293
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
They grew up all so fast these days.

294
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And you got a nice and bucky head.

295
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yes.

296
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So I'm watching my daughter, like any dad water,

297
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
making sure that her boyfriend's out of the scumbags.

298
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That I was.

299
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
When I was at age.

300
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And at the same time, I'm going to remember that when I met my daughter's mother,

301
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
we're now divorced.

302
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
She was in 2017 and I was 29.

303
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Are you with us?

304
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So I can see it from both sides.

305
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm so to speak.

306
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yes, I was out scumbag who was pinching somebody's daughter.

307
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
This is the same time.

308
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I've never got the daughter off that age.

309
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Who was scumbags?

310
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm over there.

311
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The Charlie did.

312
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's like you're divorced.

313
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So that's my whole point.

314
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It doesn't.

315
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You have like a couple shots against you.

316
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You were what?

317
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Well, you 20.

318
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What?

319
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's like 12 years older than she was?

320
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And my advice is because you can throw your kids' lives.

321
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You can be there to pick them up when they get hurt.

322
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But don't try and control them too much because they're low-needed.

323
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm sure you remember when you and I've said something.

324
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You did the complete opposite.

325
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Give that advice.

326
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Don't make demands.

327
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
They're always going to be there and looking to their parents to pack them up and pick them up.

328
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Okay.

329
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Words are advice and don't laugh.

330
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
This has been two days.

331
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'll now do them.

332
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Thank you very much.

333
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
We're not telling you or not to go see Liam.

334
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
How can we?

335
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
We have this 15 years age difference between the two of us.

336
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Of course, it's a big difference between meeting each other when the younger one is in his 20s.

337
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And the older one is in her 30s versus 16 and 21.

338
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I just feel right.

339
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
We haven't forbidden her.

340
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Obviously not.

341
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And I got to tell you though.

342
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I can tell.

343
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
She's hearing what we're saying.

344
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
We're just giving her advice, right?

345
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
We're not saying she can't go out with him.

346
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
We're not saying he can't come over here.

347
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
We're not forbidding her from doing anything.

348
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
If you put a belief, I'm keeping my fucking eye on it.

349
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I think you better believe that.

350
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah, this topic of conversation brought up a lot of feedback.

351
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Particularly regarding...

352
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Hey.

353
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Hello, son.

354
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What is that?

355
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What's...

356
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Where's that coming from?

357
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The hell was that?

358
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Is it...

359
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's not my blackberry?

360
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The fuck is that?

361
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Where's this coming from?

362
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh, hold on.

363
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's another phone.

364
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Shit.

365
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Who called?

366
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Interesting.

367
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Someone from the Netherlands.

368
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
This is a really old phone I never used.

369
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
He could tell.

370
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It was actually my windows mobile.

371
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
That's interesting.

372
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I don't have to see what that's all about.

373
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Anyway.

374
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
PWF ended 10th of course.

375
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
He was trying to be humorous.

376
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I thought it was pretty funny.

377
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But he sends it a pretty twisted comment.

378
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
PW, my brother.

379
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I love you, man.

380
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But that was really, really creepy.

381
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But the comment he sent in that Adam Curry about checking out your daughter's friend.

382
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It was like a really sick porno movie.

383
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Please don't do that again.

384
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Oh, man.

385
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Oh, man.

386
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Oh, man.

387
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Have you ever heard a message from the future?

388
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Hello.

389
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
This is, this is Edward Lloyd.

390
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Am I getting through?

391
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Can you hear me?

392
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Recording this.

393
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
In the future.

394
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The countdown has begun.

395
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The transformation starts September 1st.

396
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Words from thefeature.com.

397
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Comics trip.

398
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Comics trip.

399
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Comics trip.

400
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Comics trip.

401
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Comics trip.

402
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Comics trip.

403
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Comics trip.

404
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
This is left channel.

405
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
This is right channel.

406
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Higher Adam Blackberry.

407
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I mean, Curry sausage.

408
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Curry roast.

409
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yum.

410
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Here's your European Union correspondent from comics trip.

411
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
blog.com.

412
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
In stereo.

413
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Adam, matey.

414
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I am pissed off at government of UK.

415
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Because they have fallen for tabloid propaganda.

416
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And decided to block three movement of fellow EU.

417
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
European Union citizens from Bulgaria and Romania.

418
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That joined EU on January 1st, 2007.

419
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
This is wrong.

420
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Decision.

421
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I am set.

422
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
God.

423
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Please forgive the braids for they.

424
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
No, not what they do.

425
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Yo.

426
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Our European correspondent.

427
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Comics trip blogger checking in.

428
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I haven't even read the paper yet.

429
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But I presume that the United Kingdom is said,

430
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah, we don't want the new European Union citizens in just yet.

431
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Please.

432
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Bulgaria and Romania.

433
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Stay away.

434
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh, man, they're going to catch some grief for that.

435
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's going to be interesting.

436
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Why doesn't the UK just step out of the European Union?

437
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You know, then I'm using the euro.

438
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The pound, of course, it makes them extremely powerful as a world force.

439
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
They've got great markets here, financial markets.

440
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yeah, I mean, if you'd like sheep, if it like lambs meat and pork,

441
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
what else do you need?

442
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
We don't need anything from Europe.

443
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Thank you very much, CSB, for keeping us on the tip of that.

444
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yesterday, I made a call out to the aviation podcasters.

445
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I said, hey, what the hell are you guys doing?

446
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
There's no risk aid.

447
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Nothing, you know, talking about the craft that's going on in the world.

448
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You know, about, uh, I really want some insight information.

449
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
How you guys feel about terrorism?

450
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Open up a little bit.

451
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Jo deon from fly with me.

452
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Which you can find at flywithmeet.podshow.com.

453
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
heard the call.

454
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I don't think he quite understood what I was asking for.

455
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Maybe our emails just crossed and he hasn't even heard my show yet.

456
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
But he did send me a clip from a recent episode about the mile high clubs.

457
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
He's talking to one of the flight attendants on one of his flights that he captain.

458
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And he walked in actually on someone having sex on the 76.

459
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
We are on the other way doing it because we could hear the park.

460
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I've got to get to do it.

461
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Nobody would go in.

462
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Psycho. Oh, screw that out.

463
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Go in.

464
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Psycho up in an up and up in the door.

465
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
What did you see when you walked in?

466
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Two pair of asses.

467
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And you know, a little, a little plumped and a sweat and going on.

468
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yeah, you got to listen to the show to hear the rest of it.

469
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Flywithmeet.podshow.com.

470
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
From that show, actually learned how you can open the laboratories in an aircraft.

471
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You know, it's really simple.

472
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You think that they might have some kind of past key or something.

473
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
But if you look at the actual sign, and this goes for the 747, I think the 400 series.

474
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
This definitely works on Virgin Airlines because I've tried it.

475
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So you have that little sign that when someone's inside and they slide the,

476
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
the bolt to the right, which locks the door and it says occupied.

477
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
That actual, the enclosing of the occupied sign can slide left or right.

478
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So if you want to open the door, you just slide that over to the,

479
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
well, whichever the opposite direction is of the door frame,

480
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
towards the inside of the door, and it'll pop right open.

481
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Just a little tip for all my Charlie friends.

482
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And if you do that, you might want to consider recording that and sending me the audio.

483
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Business week is doing their annual poll of the,

484
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I think they call it the best of the web is that what they call it.

485
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Let me just take a look.

486
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I have the link here.

487
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'll put that in the show.

488
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
No, it's obviously a daily source code.com.

489
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Let me check.

490
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Why isn't this not opening?

491
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I don't know why they do this in September or August of September.

492
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But apparently, daily source code has been nominated for Best Podcast.

493
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Let me see.

494
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yeah, a best of the web is what it's called.

495
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Okay.

496
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So I'll put a link in the show notes.

497
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Vote for me if you feel it's right.

498
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Or vote for Vicky.

499
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Vicky.

500
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Vicky.

501
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Richase.

502
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Vicky.

503
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Richie.

504
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What if you want to do?

505
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's really weird.

506
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Ask a ninja is also on the nomination list.

507
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And so you've got a podcast that isn't publicly available.

508
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You've got a video podcast and you've got a daily source code in this.

509
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I can't remember what the other nominees were.

510
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You can also write in your own nominee.

511
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But I thought that was pretty interesting is that they're really mixing it up.

512
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's almost, you know, it's like difficult.

513
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You know, how do you really put that all into one category?

514
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I don't know if that's actually possible.

515
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Yesterday we talked about the gemma in Germany and the podcast music network.

516
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And Thomas checks in with that.

517
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Hi, Adam.

518
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
This is Thomas from the German podcast association.

519
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
By the way, I don't like any podcast.

520
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I don't like associations in general.

521
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm kind of against it.

522
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I don't think they do anything except create lots and lots of paperwork and notes and

523
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
wikis and stuff like that and rarely ever get anything done.

524
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But let's see what Thomas has to say.

525
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
We are in to the discussion about gma and rights to play podcasts since October 2004.

526
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Let me help you and the other podcasts to understand what's going on.

527
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
First, if an artist has a contract with a gma,

528
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
there's no possibility to make any exception for him or for the gma.

529
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Whenever his song is played in public via radio, podcast, or even in the live performance,

530
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
you have to pay for it.

531
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Second, if you, even if you have.

532
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The new gma license for podcasts, you need also a lowence from the gbl,

533
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
which is the association of record labels or from the record label directly.

534
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It doesn't matter what PMN do, it's a matter of how gma and gvl react.

535
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Maybe the artist themselves should be put some pressure on the gma,

536
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
as long as gma controls the right of publicity playing songs.

537
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
They are in advantage.

538
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
We think one of the major changes should be that artists and Germany are allowed

539
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
to restrict the contract with the gma.

540
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
That means they should be able to allow PMN or similar networks

541
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
to give the podcasts the rights to play the songs.

542
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
That would be the only possibility to be on a legal and on a right side.

543
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Thanks, bye-bye.

544
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Hi Thomas, or of course you could put it on the pod show on the podcast,

545
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
the library network servers are based in the US.

546
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
That may technically be the way to do it.

547
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
But I just say stop chasing it.

548
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Don't run around, don't ask people if the artist aren't.

549
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
If there is an awareness part and I think we should all make artists aware

550
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
that these performing rights organizations outside of the US

551
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
have a monopoly on who was able to collect fees or who was able to license their music

552
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
and I think that we need to continue with that awareness campaign.

553
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
But that's about it.

554
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And just don't play.

555
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm sorry.

556
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Just don't play him if they're registered in the gma database

557
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
and you can't play him.

558
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Don't play him.

559
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Don't go running after all these organizations and trying and fixing it.

560
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It's just not going to work.

561
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It just doesn't happen that way.

562
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I got really tired of trying to do that here in the States.

563
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It does not work.

564
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Or, of course, you could move over here.

565
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yeah, come on over here.

566
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
You can stay with me for a little while.

567
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Just a little while.

568
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
This weekend, I'm actually leaving tomorrow Friday.

569
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I've got a big, big flying weekend.

570
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So I hope the weather is going to be reasonable enough, I guess.

571
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
There's hopefully no more hail and thunderstorms predicted in Holland.

572
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Throughout the month of September, we've got a lot of reverse engineering

573
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
and backing up to do for our paperwork.

574
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
We went to New York to get our marriages, certificate copies,

575
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
which has an upper steel affixed to it to make it official.

576
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
This weekend on Saturday, we're spreading my mom's ashes.

577
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Beautiful place that my sisters found.

578
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Now, this is illegal, so I'm not going to tell you where it is.

579
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
But it's actually, it's a place that is called butterfly park, if you can believe it.

580
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And so we're going to do that on Saturday.

581
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Since we're going to do that in the afternoon, I don't want to be rushed.

582
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'm going to stay in Amsterdam, stay overnight and fly back on Sunday.

583
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Which is the third of September, a date I'll always remember.

584
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:14,000
But tomorrow, so Friday, Patricia is going along and we're going to do a quick trip up and back,

585
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
because she has to get some paperwork squared away.

586
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So it's off to get the paperwork done, then I bring her back and then Saturday,

587
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
probably mid-morning, not too early, fly over to Amsterdam for the weekend.

588
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
So I'm not quite sure what's going to happen with the show tomorrow.

589
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
But we'll weasel it in somewhere, I'm sure.

590
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And then Saturday, third of September, as I said, it's my birthday.

591
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
42.

592
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Now, we don't do much with birthdays in the curry cottage.

593
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I think after a certain number.

594
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You know, I mean, yes, sweet 16 was fantastic.

595
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Christina's 18th will be a big deal, her 21st, and then she's on her own, man.

596
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And then we're just done with celebrating.

597
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Franco from Rockcast Italia has caught on.

598
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
He congratulated me a couple days early.

599
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And he sent in something which is from the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, a piece of audio.

600
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And I forgot all about this, but 42 is quite an impressive number actually.

601
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Good evening. Oh, deep thought.

602
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Do you have them?

603
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I'm not so for you.

604
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yes.

605
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I have.

606
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Really is one.

607
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
There really is one.

608
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,000
To everything, to the great question of life, the universe, and everything.

609
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Yes.

610
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Now you ready to give it to us?

611
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
No.

612
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
No.

613
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Wow.

614
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Though I don't think you're going to like it.

615
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It doesn't matter where we must know it.

616
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
No.

617
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Yes, now.

618
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
All right.

619
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Oh well.

620
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You're really not going to like the tellers.

621
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
All right.

622
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
The answer to everything.

623
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Yes.

624
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Live.

625
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Yes.

626
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Yes.

627
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Yes.

628
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yes.

629
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
42.

630
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Yeah.

631
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
We are going to get lynched.

632
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Yes.

633
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
There you go.

634
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
42.

635
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Do you know something special about the number 42?

636
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Let me know.

637
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Voice mail number 1, 2, 0, 1, 6, 2, 5, 6, 3, 5, 7.

638
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And here is another one of our finalists for the earthling ad challenge.

639
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Vying for $2,000 in economic reward and huge social reward knowing that the winner will be used as the actual advertising for earthling.

640
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
10 lessons I've learned while surfing the internet number 1.

641
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Enter your email address on some websites as an open invitation to spam.

642
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Number 2.

643
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Before forwarding an email about the ghost of a dead boy appearing in the theatrical film.

644
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Three men in a baby.

645
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Check Snopes.com first.

646
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Number 3.

647
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Spyware.

648
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Then forms you that you have spyware is not very helpful.

649
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Number 4.

650
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
The FBI will never send you an email warning about your visiting 40 illegal websites.

651
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
They'll simply bust down your door.

652
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Number 5.

653
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Never ever Google the Toronto-based quartet.

654
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
The barricade ladies on a computer at work.

655
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Number 6.

656
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Bill Gates and Microsoft are not tracking this email.

657
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And fording it to 15 other people will not get Walt Disney signed to send you free passes to Walt Disney World.

658
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Number 7.

659
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
There is no such thing as a national do not email registry.

660
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Number 8.

661
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
There is no ousted prints in Bangladesh willing to share $15 million with you.

662
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Number 10.

663
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You think as your service provider will solve most of these problems.

664
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Unfortunately, the remaining few will take some common sense.

665
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I like that one.

666
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
That was pretty good.

667
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It was a good internet lore in there.

668
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
As you probably know, this program is...

669
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And more people are paying attention if you want to make your podcast the easy way.

670
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Design specifically for independent audio production in real time.

671
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Dummy proof, which is why I use it.

672
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It works on a PC.

673
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Then you want to check out Cast Blaster.

674
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Hey Adam, this is Steve of the student to be the ardent octopus cast.

675
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I think we're going to call it.

676
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
It hasn't happened yet.

677
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
But I'll tell you why.

678
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I just wanted to mention to you that Cali Lewis is unbelievable.

679
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And you did a great little interview about Cast Blaster.

680
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Me and some friends have been trying to put a podcast together.

681
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Basically, our lives are hectic and busy.

682
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
We're pulled in 9,000 directions at once.

683
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
So I decided to go ahead and take the initiatives and put it all together and just have them contribute

684
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
the content because that might be one way to get it done.

685
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And I wanted you to know that I know that you're a doer.

686
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And you get things done.

687
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And I don't know that I necessarily am.

688
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
But I really want to be.

689
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And you inspire a person in that direction.

690
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So look for our podcast soon because we are going to do it.

691
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
We're not going to stop until it's done.

692
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
We're going to call you back unless you know that the ardent octopus podcast is available for

693
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
subscription, download, whatever.

694
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And enjoyment.

695
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Holder.

696
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Have a great day.

697
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Alright man.

698
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Thank you very much.

699
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Looking forward to it.

700
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Some of your promo when you're all new.

701
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
