00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Already a hit state side. Now you can check out the following podcast and good old

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,800
blightybtpodshot.com single-handedly making a mens for giving you Madonna.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,800
One show at a time.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,680
The DSC 499, the big one, before the big one. Congratulations Adam.

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,080
And on Fubar Friday, nonetheless.

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,160
I'll tell you some people say you have to be crazy to do this many shows. I mean, 499 shows.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,160
And I don't know, what do you think Adam?

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,760
Yeah. I was wondering if you can always understand

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,760
because sometimes it sounds a little rough. But anyway, as far as I know,

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,920
I'm in pocket. We're going to finalize plans. I think I just might go,

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,480
um, I don't know if I should go next week because next week is kind of like, you know,

12
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,320
I'm just not sure. I have half a mind. I have no idea why I said that. I'm spacing out a little bit today.

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,360
Okay, Lady Patricia, can you come help Adam and Q-the-music?

14
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:38,640
This is Delta, Sierra Charlie for online.

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,600
And after the song, Adam Kerry, who is a gay, um, blonde, is coming.

16
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,400
But first, Latin Italian secret, to speed up via girl absorption from 7 to 5 minutes,

17
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,000
it's enough to add splendors with enough of your key or coffee,

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,400
which you bring after my agrarian time.

19
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,640
We will be with the same vibe, so I'm feeling really right.

20
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:37,840
We're all in the moonlight, down at the healing ground, now I'm at the healing ground.

21
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:47,280
I've already done this wrong.

22
00:02:47,280 --> 00:03:01,520
I've already done this wrong, now I've already done this wrong, now I've already done this wrong.

23
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:31,520
I've already done this wrong, now I've already done this wrong, now I've already done this wrong, now I've already done this wrong, now I've already done this wrong, now I've already done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong

24
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:41,320
now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now I've done this wrong, now traveled

25
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,520
I've already gone this wrong

26
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,520
Do I really miss y'all this wrong?

27
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:23,520
Can someone be found?

28
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,520
Now that I'm here around

29
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,520
It's only me if I have to leave

30
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,520
Don't worry about me

31
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,520
It's a must-bearing dream I'll go like I'm in this wrong

32
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,520
Right now that I hear it right now

33
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,520
Do I really miss y'all this wrong?

34
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,520
Right now that I hear it right now

35
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:15,520
Right now that I hear it right now

36
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Do I really miss y'all this wrong?

37
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,520
You got to be like me to recognize the name

38
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
But the music speaks for itself

39
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,520
Wishbone Ash on the pod save music network

40
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,520
How did we miss them coming aboard?

41
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,520
Fantastic

42
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,520
Of course they've been hugely successful all over the world

43
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,520
35 years I think their career

44
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,520
12 UK top 40 albums and still under leadership

45
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,520
Of guitarist and singer Andy Powell

46
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,520
They got a brand new album out planned destiny

47
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,520
Wishbone Ash

48
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,520
Kickin' off our footballer Friday

49
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,520
Everybody coming to you from a shopping wetsuri

50
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,520
The affluent suburb that is known as Gilford

51
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
And the curry cottage is really nasty outside

52
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,520
It is the daily source code episode 499 or 9 or 9 or

53
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,520
Moving up on that

54
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,520
I have no plans to celebrate it

55
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
But people are sending me so much stuff

56
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,520
There's no doubt I'm gonna have to do something cool with it

57
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,520
And I send you shit in I'm happy to play it all

58
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,520
And of course it's great because the lady Patricia is back

59
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,520
I know you're waiting for it to pipe in but she's not on the microphone

60
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,520
Now you know what this is what happens every single time

61
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,520
She goes away for two days and she comes home

62
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,520
And I've really done my best

63
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,520
I even prepped Christina I said look dude

64
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
You know I really went all out for you

65
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
You know I was supposed to be in London

66
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,520
And doing all the stuff through phones and taking you to the hospital

67
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,520
And just tell Mama was great and then I did a good job

68
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,520
Yeah

69
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,520
And the first thing Christina says is oh well you know I was a bit hungry

70
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,520
That's what she tells Patricia

71
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,520
And Patricia has to go around the house and has to inspect every single corner

72
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
And every inch and make sure everything's been done properly

73
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
And so she's still doing that

74
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,520
So maybe she'll maybe she'll walk in later on in the show

75
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,520
In the meantime we've got a lot of stuff to take care of

76
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,520
Because it is time once again

77
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
From my girlfriend Amy Mack

78
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,520
To help me slim my ass down

79
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,520
It's Amy Mack how are you?

80
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Hey baby I'm good

81
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
I'm ready for some exercise

82
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,520
Today we're going to take the plane squats from a few weeks ago

83
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
And take them up and up

84
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,520
I'm going to get the other mic running

85
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
Why?

86
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
Because you're getting that good

87
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,520
Yeah right

88
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,520
All right switch my escape situated

89
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,520
Okay more over here now

90
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
That's right

91
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
I'm set

92
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
Are you ready?

93
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,520
Yeah what am I doing?

94
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,520
Okay

95
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,520
Feed a little wider than shoulder with a part

96
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
Okay got it

97
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,520
Toes pointing straight forwards

98
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
Straight forward

99
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,520
Now you're going to squat with your weight and the heels of your feet

100
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,520
And swing your arms down towards your knees

101
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,520
And then as you come back up

102
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,520
Jump

103
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,520
You're going to use your arms as well

104
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
I'm going to move all the way up

105
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
And then you come back down

106
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
I've got to watch Chandler

107
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,520
Slow controlled squat

108
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,520
Let me try it ready

109
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,520
And also when you land you want to make sure your knees are bent

110
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
And don't know the length

111
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,520
Okay

112
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,520
I think you have the idea

113
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,520
Oh I'm already started

114
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,520
Do eight

115
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,520
Ready go

116
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
And squat in

117
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,520
Jump

118
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,520
Eight

119
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,520
And squat in

120
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,520
Jump

121
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
Seven

122
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
And squat in

123
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,520
All your muscles to try to land squat

124
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
And jump

125
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
Six

126
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
Make sure those knees don't come off your toes

127
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,520
Even on the jump

128
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
Five

129
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,520
Use your arms as guidance and momentum

130
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
Jump

131
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
Four

132
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
And jump

133
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,520
Squat

134
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,520
Are you squeezing that booty?

135
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
Yes

136
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
Squat

137
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
Two

138
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,520
Last one

139
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,520
And jump

140
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,520
Great

141
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,520
All right

142
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,520
Okay that was an adventure

143
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
Oh man

144
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,520
That was your first day of super advanced squat

145
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,520
It sucks

146
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,520
See it doesn't necessarily get any easier

147
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
The more you work out

148
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,520
But it doesn't get boring either

149
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,520
No

150
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,520
All right

151
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,520
This is Amy Mac from Fitness Attack

152
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,520
And until next time

153
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,520
That's just

154
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,520
Amy

155
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,520
I wasn't prepared for that

156
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,520
Oh yeah

157
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,520
Holy crap

158
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,520
Yeah

159
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,520
Remember what football stands for my friends

160
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,520
Fucked up beyond all repair

161
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,520
Adam Paul here

162
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,520
Just a bit about your comment on Apple's deal

163
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,520
To install iPod Docs on the seats of a bunch of major airlines

164
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
So you said

165
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,520
So in essence what is being said is

166
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,520
If I understand the release correctly from Apple

167
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,520
Is that you'll be able to plug your iPod into your seat

168
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,520
And yes I find that interesting too

169
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,520
Especially when you say

170
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,520
Oh this is kind of interesting

171
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,520
Apple announced

172
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,520
That a whole bunch of airlines are going to support

173
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,520
Purchasing music

174
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,520
With your iPod on the plane

175
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,520
Because I couldn't find that

176
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,520
And any of the coverage about the proposed deals

177
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,520
What the articles are saying

178
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,520
Is that you'll be able to plug your iPod into the seat

179
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,520
And

180
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,520
Charge it

181
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,520
Play your own content on the larger screen

182
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,520
On the seat in front of you

183
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,520
And play your music through their noise canceling headphones

184
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,520
I agree with you

185
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,520
That the KLM spoke when this comment

186
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,520
Was funny and puts Apple in its place

187
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
Regarding KLM

188
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,520
But there are four other airlines mentioned

189
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,520
Besides KLM and air France

190
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,520
UAL corpse United Airlines seems to be quite keen on the idea in an article in the press room

191
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,520
On their site saying

192
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,520
From Chicago on November 14th

193
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,520
As part of United's plan to upgrade its international first and business class travel experience for customers

194
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,520
United and Apple have teamed up to add iPod connectivity to United's flights

195
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,520
Entertainment service

196
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,520
This connectivity will enable customers to plug in and charge their iPod

197
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,520
Watch movies and TV shows on their iPod using United's big screen monitors

198
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Ooh

199
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,520
As well as listen to their entire music library on United's noise canceling headsets

200
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,520
That's all well and good

201
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,520
But your little mix of badmout

202
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,520
The airlines installing download capability is most interesting to me

203
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,520
This is where the real benefits are

204
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,520
This is huge dude

205
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
We have to talk about this

206
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,520
I'm in San Francisco

207
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,520
So when some guy you don't know tries to contact you next week

208
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,520
When you're here in town

209
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,520
Please try and remember me

210
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
Love the show

211
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,520
I hope Christina's knee gets better soon

212
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,520
Thanks from Paul at pdvd.wordpress.com

213
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,520
And oh

214
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,520
Find a scrunching

215
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
Oh scrunching roll

216
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,520
Paul, thank you very much

217
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,520
Yeah, and I went back and I read that release in your right

218
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
I made a mistake

219
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,520
But I tried to look for it

220
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,520
I have read another report that song purchasing would be possible

221
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:03,520
I guess the whole point was really is that Apple announced the KLM Air France F-Rolls

222
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,520
And it wasn't true

223
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,520
That's really what that was about

224
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,520
Personally, I don't know it's such a good idea

225
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,520
I mean the idea of being able to connect an external device

226
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,520
I mean what is the benefit really

227
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
You know

228
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,520
Are my headphones going to be less?

229
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,520
Let's put it the other way around

230
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,520
Well the headphones on an airline that they give me to use

231
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,520
Their noise canceling headsets

232
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520
Will it be better than what I have myself?

233
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,520
Will it be better than earbuds?

234
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
Hmm

235
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,520
Okay, so maybe jacking your video into the screen

236
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
I don't know

237
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,520
It sounds like it's the marketing thing that no one really cares about

238
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
I just smite

239
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,520
Yeah, whatever

240
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
But

241
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,520
Can you tell I'm still a lot of breath

242
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Hey, so yesterday

243
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
I've tried, you know, you know, I took

244
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,520
Pretend Christina to the doctor

245
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
And then we indeed had to go get an MRI

246
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,520
Which was a pretty interesting

247
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,520
Never seen an MRI machine before

248
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,520
It's basically a one huge unbelievably

249
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,520
Powerful magnet

250
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,520
That has a waiting room attached to it

251
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,520
And a cashier

252
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,520
It's a complete commercial business

253
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,520
Obviously

254
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,520
So we'll know in

255
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,520
Sometime next week

256
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,520
But I gotta tell you

257
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
I am a bit fearful

258
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,520
Then operation is going to be needed

259
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,520
To fish out some of the broken cartilage

260
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,520
By the way

261
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,520
I spoke to another

262
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,520
Another specialist

263
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,520
And this kind of stuff apparently happens with adolescent women

264
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
Quite a lot

265
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
That they throw the knee caps out and stuff

266
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,520
And apparently it's because their hips broadened out

267
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,520
And the weight distribution

268
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,520
Is all off and you have to get used to that

269
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,520
And it just seems to happen quite frequently with

270
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,520
Adolescent women as what I said

271
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520
But I'll just say my teenage daughter

272
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,520
I'm a school friend and I'm a new kid

273
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,520
I'm just been listening to doctor

274
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,520
If you were a theory

275
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,520
Or is it going to be for the night

276
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
Yeah

277
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,520
I don't know what the NHS

278
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
I don't know if it's going to be for the health service

279
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,520
It's basically going to be the base

280
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,520
Or for that look service

281
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,520
I don't know if brands are going to be in play

282
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,520
And then the whole price comes

283
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,520
And it runs if you're over 16

284
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,520
And you're nursing full time education

285
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,520
If you're over 16

286
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,520
And you're in full time education

287
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,520
It's a lot of work to do

288
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,520
But the official fee may be gonna run right

289
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,520
No money or not

290
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,520
No money or not

291
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,520
All the money is left

292
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,520
And I don't know the price and

293
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,520
The message and the micro

294
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,640
And WWWWBWBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB

295
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:53,640
I was right national health care service and pretty good though, you know, of course yesterday was a private visit.

296
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,640
Oh, 500 pounds for the MRI and it was a special deal.

297
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,640
They said, well, you know, since it really isn't busy, special deal, 500 pounds just for you sir.

298
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,640
I got a nice cup of tea and Christina got a nice cup of hot chocolate to go with that.

299
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:12,640
But it's interesting, I think, you know, our new Congress should...

300
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,640
Have you ever noticed how the Brits say Congress?

301
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,640
States we say Congress.

302
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,640
And here they say Congress.

303
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,640
Suttled differences, differences, but they're there.

304
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,640
When looking at a national health care system, look at what's happening here in the UK.

305
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,640
Very interesting.

306
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:35,640
Of course, the system is always bankrupt and lots of people complain and lots of people die

307
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
unnecessarily.

308
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:44,640
But I think if you really evaluated it and you look at all the waiting times that people, you know, have to endure.

309
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,640
But still get treatment.

310
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,640
I think it's probably a really good system.

311
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,640
I think the US could learn something from it.

312
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,640
You know, it's basic health care.

313
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,640
It really is.

314
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,640
And I don't know.

315
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,640
I guess the grass is always greener on the other side.

316
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,640
And it's funny how people here in Britain are always complaining about the national health care

317
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,640
system, about the health care service.

318
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,640
I just hear it everywhere.

319
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
I read it everywhere.

320
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
I see it on the news.

321
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,640
I think if you guys are so fucking lucky.

322
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,640
You know, at least you have some kind of health care system.

323
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,640
If you want to chime in, all you have to do is call our phone number.

324
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:32,640
Plus 4, 4, 2, 0, 7, 16, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3, plus 4, 4, 2, 0, 7, 6, 8, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3.

325
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,640
That's so nice to hear all the Brits Calling.

326
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,640
Especially on that we've launched BTPodShow.com.

327
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:43,640
It seems like a lot of people are calling in and getting involved and paying attention.

328
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,640
Thank you very much for everyone who sent in comments that I had yesterday.

329
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:52,640
The question I had about the dialogue box folder settings in Windows.

330
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,640
Chris Murray told me what to do.

331
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,640
And essentially, see, I was thinking if you want to change something in the view of dialogue

332
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,640
box when you're trying to open a file from another application that you would change setting

333
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,640
in there, which you can do.

334
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,640
But apparently the way to do it is to open up a folder.

335
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Let me see how I do that now.

336
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:20,640
You open up the folder and then you go to folder options and then you go to view.

337
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,640
And of course, you want to set the folder options the way you want to set it the way you want it.

338
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,640
And then you say, apply to all folders and then it works.

339
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,640
I have no idea how it got reset, but it did.

340
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,640
And thank you very much, Chris and others who sent that in to me because I was really lost.

341
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,640
It was taken me three extra clicks per edition to the playlist and cast blaster and really sucked.

342
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,640
Hi Adam, it's Archie.

343
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
I'm on the way home from work and I'm just catching up.

344
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,640
I've been around business and just catching up with some of the podcasts I've missed.

345
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,640
I've listened to two of yours on the back.

346
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
Back to back.

347
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,640
And I've just listened to three of Paul Nichols' podcasts.

348
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,640
136137 and 138.

349
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,640
There's one guy in the podcasting mode of the moment who deserves more credit to what he's doing.

350
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
It's Paul Nichols.

351
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,640
The Slavic Land Podcasts he's done this year and the Slavic Land Podcasts he did last year deserve an award.

352

We've already have our songs.

406
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,640
Uh oh.

407
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,640
Uh oh.

408
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,640
Oh, really yay!

409
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,640
Yeah oh, we're like,

410
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,640
you played as well too,

411
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,640
Yeah yeah, ya.

412
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,620
Oh, hey.

413
00:20:53,620 --> 00:21:00,100
It's me, myself, you know I'm way too long to hold

414
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:05,740
I hold it my own and I can still feel all dancing with you

415
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,380
You know I'm way too long

416
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:25,500
I hold it my own and I can still feel all dancing with you

417
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:31,940
You know I'm way too long to hold it my own and I can still feel all dancing

418
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:37,940
I can still take this mask off and let my guard down

419
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:42,940
With all our storm on the prone will fade

420
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:49,940
So now I've become so jaded and I'm tired of it

421
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,940
You know I'm way too long to hold out no more light

422
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,940
And I'm feeling it now

423
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:08,940
I've waited so long to find a place inside and I can finally be myself

424
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,940
You know I'm way too long to hold

425
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:18,940
I hold it my own and I can still feel all dancing with you

426
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:24,940
You know I'm way too long to hold

427
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,940
I hold it my own and I can still feel all dancing with you

428
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:39,940
You know I'm way too long to hold I'm way too long to hold it my own and I can still feel all dancing with you

429
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:54,940
You know I'm way too long to hold it my own and I can still feel all dancing with you

430
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,940
You know I'm way too long to hold

431
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,940
And I'll think I'll be in love with this body

432
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:07,940
With this crazy sun I know I can finally be myself

433
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,940
You know what I'm waiting for long to hold

434
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,940
Oh world of my own, I know I'm so good

435
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:21,940
All that I'll see You know I'm waiting for long to find

436
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,940
This crazy sun I know I can finally be myself

437
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,940
You know I'm waiting for long to hold

438
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,940
These walls are my fault

439
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,940
And I can show you just what I'm waiting for

440
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:49,940
You know I'm waiting for long to hold

441
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,940
Marcus really knows how to crank up a food bar Friday

442
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,940
Thank you very much my friend. I was looking for that song in the podcast and music network for the show

443
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,940
No today the source code could not find it

444
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,940
So I just got a presumed that that's something special Marcus sent in for us

445
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,940
There you go pod show in London pod show in San Francisco

446
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,940
Lots of stuff going on

447
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,940
Oh, you know, I played the enormous penis song earlier in the week

448
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,940
And Antoine Adams, who I believe is from the Netherlands

449
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,940
Found a clip on YouTube. Here's something I got to remember to put in the show notes

450
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,940
It is the Da Vinci's notebook the guy who put the song up on the podcast and music network

451
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,940
And this time it's the entire song. I've never actually heard the whole song

452
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,940
And in this case they do it a capella

453
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,940
On a live radio show

454
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,940
Let me see if there's any information about where this was done

455
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,940
Of course not you know when people just upload shit to YouTube

456
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,940
But they never actually put any information in there. It says a live radio show

457
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,940
So I'm by Da Vinci's notebook

458
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:48,940
Let me just let you listen to this because it is so good not only the lyrics fantastic

459
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,940
You probably only heard just a portion of them

460
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:56,940
But also the arrangement and the way these guys sing this accapella just blew me away

461
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,940
I have in the studio very very excited to say hello to people listening all over the world

462
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,940
I don't want you guys to feel any pressure but people listening in the internet

463
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,940
Literally in every continent ships it's sea tuned in

464
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,940
That's fine as long as my mother doesn't listen

465
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,940
And all the rest of the Chinese people won't understand what I'm saying

466
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,940
Here we go

467
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,940
You don't know which way to go

468
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,940
Come on and take a walk in my shoes

469
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,940
Never worry about a thing

470
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:54,940
Got the world on a string because I've got the cure for all of my

471
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,940
All of his blues

472
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:02,940
I take a look at my enormous penis

473
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,940
And my troubles start to melt away

474
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,940
I take a look at my enormous penis

475
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,940
And the happy times are coming to stay

476
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,940
I gotta sing it on dance when I glance in my pants

477
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,940
And the time is like a sunshiney day

478
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,940
I take a look at my enormous penis

479
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,940
And everything is going my way

480
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:48,940
And everything is going my way

481
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,940
I take a look at my enormous penis

482
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,940
Salvation

483
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,940
And everything is going my way

484
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,940
And maybe thank you

485
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,940
Have a bit of chat

486
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,940

Help me

488
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:16,940
Just Bob and Tom, I'll take a look at my enormous penis and every time I come to see

489
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:24,940
Yeah, I got great big amounts in the place where it comes and the feeling like a sunshine

490
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:32,940
I take a look at my enormous penis and everything is going my way

491
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,940
I'm Bob and Tom now everything is going my way

492
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,940
Hey look at these coobers

493
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,940
I do I want

494
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,940
I guess it was the Bob and Tom show that

495
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,940
Those guys are so awesome. They should do more. They should do a whole album of stuff like that man

496
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,940
That's just awesome. Food bar Friday on the daily source code

497
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,940
Of course, so lots of Brits calling and don't forget you yanks are welcome to

498
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:18,940
One, two, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven

499
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:26,940
One, two, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven

500
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,940
Ah, hey Adam, this is Paul Smith, though. There it is. We'll forward a

501
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,940
Hey, I got just a quick comment about the feeds for Pod Show

502
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,940
It seems like that's all that I've got mostly in my juice pod catcher

503
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,940
And it seems like all day long while I'm at work my little computer has been downloading all of your

504
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:50,940
All the pod show feeds and I'm not sure I guess something's happening on that side

505
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,940
Anyway, it came to my attention by my wife saying that

506
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,940
Gosh, the bandwidth is too slow. It's much lag

507
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,940
She was trying to download porn, dude. Anyway, we wouldn't want to interfere with that

508
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,940
Anyway, let us know what's going on with the feeds for Pod Show.

509
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,940
Thanks, love the show.

510
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,940
You know, I don't know. This is the kind of crap that can always happen.

511
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,940
We do an upgrade of something. The URLs that you're reaching should not have changed

512
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,940
It should be exactly the same. So it could be a pub date or something

513
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,940
Of course, juice is a very sophisticated pod catcher

514
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:35,940
Andrew Grummet, who works at Pod Show, was one of the original architects of the pod catcher

515
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,940
Normally known as iPodder, iPodder Lemon, now known as juice

516
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,940
I did receive, I think one or two other reports of this happening

517
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,940
Of course, it sucks tremendous ass. If all of a sudden it starts to download,

518
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,940
It shows that you've already had and slurp up your bandwidth

519
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,940
So we'll see if we can figure out exactly what happened

520
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,940
It must be something in the feed itself that has changed

521
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,940
Perhaps a pub date. I don't know. I'm sorry, I really am

522
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,940
Because I know how much of a pain in the ass that is

523
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,940
Particularly when you're trying to download porn, man, and your pipe gets all filled up

524
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,940
The series of tubes with truck stuck in the middle

525
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,940
Time for a new a new feature on our food bar Friday

526
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,940
They already threatened they would do it

527
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,940
Speaking of enormous penises, here is Chef Mark and Jennifer General

528
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,940
Adam, sweetie

529
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,940
You didn't really think Chef Mark was going to stay in your kitchen, did you?

530
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,940
Hey, I know which side my bread is buttered on

531
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,940
He's decided to return to mine instead

532
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,940
After all, I have better pots and pans

533
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,940
Oh, oh

534
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,940
Yeah, maybe

535
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,940
So Adam, we've cooked up something hot for your Friday

536
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:56,940
Welcome to finger-looking Friday with Jennifer

537
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,940
You know, and the talented kitchen virtuoso, Chef Mark

538
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,940
Since the weather's getting chilly here in New York

539
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,940
We thought we'd give you a hot little taste of Nolan's

540
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,940
With a special recipe for cafe brulo

541
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,940
It's a spicy fiery twist on coffee that's just perfect for a winter's night

542
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,940
You're going to need one quarter cup of cognac, a couple dashes of triple sack

543
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,940
Two cups of very strong hot coffee

544
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:26,940
By the way, I recommend folders gourmet selections espresso flavor for that

545
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,940
One teaspoon of lemon zest, one teaspoon orange zest

546
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,940
Two cloves, one cinnamon stick, a teaspoon of sugar

547
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,940
And of course some whipped cream to garnish

548
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,940
Brewed two cups of very strong coffee and keep it piping hot

549
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,940
Meanwhile, in a copper saucepan, mix the cognac, the triple sec

550
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,940
Citrus zest, cloves, cinnamon stick and the sugar

551
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,940
Gently heat the mixture on the stove to release the flavors of the spices and the citrus zest

552
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,940
Then you're going to flambay the liquor mixture and stir it gently

553
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,940
Meanwhile, prepare the two cups of hot coffee

554
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,940
Filter the cognac mixture, pour it over the coffee and decorate with whipped cream

555
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,940
And an additional lemon or orange twist if you like

556
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,940
Yes, you have to have whipped cream, or it's just not fun

557
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,940
You know, they might want to add some flavored splendor to it

558
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,940
Only if there are a scruncher, anyway

559
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,940

And Jennifer is the mistress of foodfullossafee.podshow.com

561
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,940
Talk to you next week Adam

562
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,940
Have a great weekend, ladies

563
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,940
Happy cooking

564
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,940
Oh, Jennifer Jennifer with your pots and pans

565
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,940
You know, I kind of like doing this

566
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,940
Because it's something that when you're on your way home

567
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,940
Friday or maybe if you're on your way to do some weekend shopping on Saturday

568
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,940
You just take the podcast along with you and you don't even really have to write anything down or copy anything or print anything out

569
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,940
Which of course would also be nice if we had some show notes to go with the finger-looking Friday

570
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,940
Jennifer's pots and pans and marks enormous penis

571
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,940
You can just take it with you to the supermarket and just hit

572
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,940
Pause every single time you get an ingredient

573
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,940
Same thing goes for the actual

574
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,940
Creation of whatever it is they're talking about

575
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,940
Sound I could almost smell it really

576
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:27,940
Hey, uh, speaking of pots and pans Jennifer, do you think that I could grab your copper sauce pan one of these days?

577
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,940
What have we forgotten today? Oh, yes, of course

578
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,940
There's one very important thing we haven't done

579
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,940
Let's all give a dive

580
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,940
To the heart and for real

581
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,940
Surgery

582
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,940
Surgery

583
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,940
Yeah

584
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,940
Yeah, what's up ACS just a time

585
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,940
The official night at musicologist of the Chacha

586
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,940
Hey, I figure if I'm a night that means that you're the king

587
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:15,940
I'm from what I understand the nights every once in a while had to go and pay tribute to the king

588
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,940
Or maybe hey, that's just a New Jersey mob in the bosses

589
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,940
But either way, I understand my place

590
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,940
And I was looking through the pot safe music network for this football Friday

591
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,940
And I realized it that you probably haven't played this artist yet

592
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,940
Her name is Louise Satara

593
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,940
She's 18 years old out of the United Kingdom

594
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,940
And she's just unbelievable and awesome

595
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,940
She's great. She's collaborated with ladiesmith Blackman Banzo

596
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,940
She's collaborated with Stains guitarists

597
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,940
And I'm just blown away by her

598
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,940
So from the pot safe music network, this is something a little different for football Friday

599
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,940
This is Louise Satara and her song, Wrong Again

600
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,940
Have a great weekend everybody, I'll check you later

601
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,940
You're going to really enjoy this song and check out her voice

602
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:19,940
I thought that in a sense would be it's own very well

603
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:27,940
In so powerless, I'm feeling my strength restored

604
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:34,940
I'm full and far enough to see which way to go

605
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,940
And I know I know I made it closer

606
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,940
This life won't lay me low

607
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,940
You thought I was broken

608
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:50,940
You thought that my time now ran out

609
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,940
Don't think for a moment

610
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:59,940
But my spirit's gone, you're wrong again

611
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:04,940
My spirit's gone, you're wrong again

612
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,940
But I found the will to carry on

613
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:13,940
And if you let us know, don't you be that strong

614
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:20,940
From the dead, oh, you're wrong again

615
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:31,940
Just when the darkness fell, my light began to shine

616
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:39,940
I could start to tell the dream that I caught mine

617
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:46,940
And I thought you feel myself, I'm losing my desire

618
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,940
And you understand, I need to take that

619
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:58,940
If you think that I'm alive, you thought I would love it

620
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,940
You thought that my time now ran out

621
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:10,940
Don't think for a moment, I spirit's gone, you're wrong again

622
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,940
My spirit's gone, you're wrong again

623
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,940
But I found the will to carry on

624
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:24,940
And if you let us know, don't you be that strong

625
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:32,940
From the dead, oh, you're wrong again

626
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:56,940
And if you let us know, don't you be that strong

627
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:03,940
Just when the darkness fell, my light began to shine

628
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:11,940
Don't think for a moment, I spirit's gone, you're wrong again

629
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:16,940
Don't think that you know, don't you be that strong

630
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:20,940
I found the will to carry on

631
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,940
And if you let us know, don't you be that strong

632
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:32,940
From the dead, oh, you're wrong again

633
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:47,940
And if you let us know, don't you be that strong

634
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:52,940
From the dead, oh, you're wrong again

635
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:59,940
And if you let us know, don't you be that strong

636
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:06,940
Oh, yeah, only 18 from the UK, her name is Luis Satara

637
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:11,940
She's actually beautiful, I'm looking at a picture in the positive music network

638
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,940
Iris Brazilian and English descent

639
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:19,940
Her brain, her debut album, still waters, very nice

640
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,940
Influences, Arita Franklin, Alicia Keys, Jostone, Jostone

641
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,940
Last night there was, and it really sucked because of course I was watching

642
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:33,940
I'm a celebrity get me out of here, so I missed the first, almost the first half of the UK Music Award

643
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,940
UK Music Hall of Fame

644
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,940
I think it was a live broadcast, oh, this was so good

645
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,940
And it was a lifetime achievement award for Dusty Springfield

646
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,940
who I'm a huge fan of

647
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,940
And Jostone came out and did a son of a preacher man

648
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,940
And she did it on, you know, just a short kind of like blue dress,

649
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,940
a bare feet and she walked throughout the entire audience

650
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,940
And just sang her ass off, it gives me goosebumps just think about it again

651
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,940
It was so incredibly good

652
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,940
And then, and this just blew me away

653
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,940
And remember, yesterday I was talking about production about music production

654
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:15,940
Sir George Martin, who of course is responsible for the entire Mercy Beat Sound

655
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,940
Very famous obviously for the work he did on the Beatles

656
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,940
He produced so many different artists throughout his career

657
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,940
And he received a lifetime achievement award

658
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,940
And I wish Patricia were here because she's a hung out with him in Malta

659
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,940
In the song contest days

660
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:35,940
So I'll have to get that dirt from her next time, I guess

661
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,940
But then he did three Beatles songs

662
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,940
And they had an all-star band, they had a huge orchestra

663
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,940
I see who was on drums

664
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,940
On drums was the name Roger Taylor from Queen

665
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:55,940
I don't remember who was in there

666
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:02,940
But it was clearly and Sir George Martin was conducting this orchestra

667
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,940
And when you listen to that and you heard the sound

668
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,940
This unbelievable every single piece filled to the right amount

669
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,940
Every just close your eyes even and it sounded so incredibly good

670
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,940
This guy really was the Beatles sound

671
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,940
No kidding, no fool and it was so good

672
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,940
It just has like, oh man, I do miss, I do miss that

673
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:31,940
And of course it's tremendously expensive to do that with live instruments

674
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:34,940
But just wanted to say it was a beautiful, beautiful thing

675
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,940
Really, really wrapped up the week just perfectly for me

676
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,940
What the hell is it today?

677
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,940
It's Friday

678
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,940
Well, you can almost know what's coming

679
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:52,940
If you live with someone in sin or if you're living in holy matrimony

680
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,940
Or if you just have some kind of social agreement

681
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:02,940
Think about your spouse because when you really evaluate your living situation

682
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:07,940
And you see what your spouse does to keep the house running

683
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,940
You should really appreciate that stuff

684
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,940
You don't think about it a lot because life just goes on

685
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,940
But just two days, you know Patricia went off, she did her own thing

686
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,940
Which I'm real happy about

687
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,940
Really glad that she's enjoying

688
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,940
Her strictly come dancing, a competition dancing with the stars

689
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:29,940
But boy, once again greater appreciation for all the shit she does to keep this place running

690
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,940
Because of course it was up to me and I had to do it

691
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:35,940
So, um, living together, living in sin, social agreement

692
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,940
Think about the stuff your spouse does and appreciate them

693
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,940
And give them a lick from me this evening

694
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,940
Will you?

695
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,940
That's it everybody

696
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,940
I guess Monday will be episode number five hundred

697
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,940
Get your crap in now, get it in early

698
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,940
If I

699
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:03,940
If I don't see a podcast con UK, that means you didn't come or you don't live in the UK

700
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,940
And of course, we'll be back here on Monday

701
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,940
Have a fantastic weekend

702
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,940
Take care everybody, bye-bye

00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,940
Another podshow podcast

704
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,940
