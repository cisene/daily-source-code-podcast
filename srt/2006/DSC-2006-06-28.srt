Delta Sierra Charlie, 413.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I got a lot of listeners.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Back in the dust.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm calling to the show.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I've got a little picture.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Where on the show?

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm on the show.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm on the show.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm on the show.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm on the show.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm on the show.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We're onto a show.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm on the show.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The honest woman�플 andmate like Mizrepo.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
They're natto and communities.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm on the show.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I like it.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I only do autograph after the show.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,200
The living's on a track of night

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,800
Covered all our tracks

27
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,400
To break some fragile files

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,000
So we talked so light

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And then we hopped

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We're not allowed to sleep

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We're not allowed to sleep

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We're not allowed to sleep

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We're not allowed to sleep

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We're not allowed to sleep

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The shadows came in

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
From the light that caused my name

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
All the creatures stood above me

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And now I'm flying towards the sun

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Can new loops that discuss weakness

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'll run somewhere heat

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
As the night bell I've heard just owls

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Say it's time to meet now

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
On the town new world

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
To carry out mission

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Neither you or I

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Whatever else I like

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
When I go to sleep

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What's up on my son

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
To sit up for his stuff

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
How could it be

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
When now I see

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The shadows came in

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
From the light that caused my name

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
All the creatures stood above me

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And now I'm flying towards the sun

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
In the night light

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We still shine bright

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
In the night light

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We still shine bright

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
In the night light

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We still shine bright

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
In the night light

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We still shine bright

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
When now I'm flying

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What's up on my son

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
To sit up for his stuff

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Where now I see

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The shadows came in

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
From the light that caused my name

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
All the creatures stood above me

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Now I'm flying towards the sun

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
There you go

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Crawling towards the sun

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
There's a nice happy sun for today

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I need that

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Are you happy to last this honeyman?

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's so good

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's okay, I'll talk about the song

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The hush sound from Illinois

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm not saying music now work

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Crawling towards the sun

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's the lady in the tramp

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Everybody, can you not get your ass up on the chair

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Or is that the

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Umpa Lumpa

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Like struggle

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Do you need a ladder?

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Hold on

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Oh

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're wrecking the studio my dear

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I know

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Already you're a barrel of fun

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Are you okay?

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Do you want me to hold the stool?

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No, it's okay

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Is the stool too high?

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I thought it was a perfect place

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
No, no, it's perfect

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
When we had our other helicopter

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I approached it on the different

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I remember when we had the Augusta helicopter

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You could never get in

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's like a flying limo

106
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The most beautiful machine in the world

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Impossible for women with dresses

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And then we actually got a little

109
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
A little step ladder

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah

111
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hey, babe, how are you doing?

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah, I'm doing fine

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah, yeah

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
One of my mom first got sick

116
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Almost two years ago

118
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Now I cleared it with her

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That I could talk about it on the show

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay

121
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So I have to tell you

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Just spoke the Tiffany, my sister

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And it's not good now

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
No

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
No, this is she actually called

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Now I saw my mom three weeks ago

128
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah

129
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No, yeah, just before you left for San Francisco

130
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The two

131
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So two and a half weeks ago

132
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah

133
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yeah

134
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And she says she actually called me to prepare me for

135
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What I see this weekend

136
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Wanna go visit her?

137
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
A really

138
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yeah

139
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What did you mom or

140
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
No Tiffany did

141
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Tiffany did

142
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Oh my god

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Well, we both had actually a very bad idea

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The day before yesterday

145
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah

146
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That night

147
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We were both thinking about it so much

148
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah

149
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That we couldn't sleep

150
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You know, so now

151
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But now we're actually talking about

152
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You know, stuff we have to talk about

153
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But didn't want to talk about

154
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah

155
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Like

156
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You know

157
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We're gonna range

158
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Cremation

159
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This is so hard

160
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's hard to find this

161
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's hard to do her makeup

162
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No, because she's always talking about

163
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah, you're laughing

164
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No, no, no, no

165
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I totally agree

166
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's the top of my list

167
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I know

168
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm gonna do your makeup, baby

169
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You know

170
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

171
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Excuse me

172
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You know what I'm making

173
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What do you mean?

174
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
If you die before I do God forbid

175
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah, you're gonna do my makeup

176
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Of course, and if you're in the hospital

177
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'll never done makeup before

178
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Dude

179
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Dude

180
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
My own makeup

181
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I've done makeup

182
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
For half my life of warm makeup

183
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
On television

184
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Because you know

185
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
They always do makeup

186
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And I've looked at that beautiful face for 20 years

187
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Now I think I know exactly

188
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
How I wanted

189
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What parts are

190
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I think your daughter is there

191
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's getting very good at it

192
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But I'll remove any hairs

193
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So I have a couple of people

194
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You know, you know that I want that

195
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And they're doing that anyway

196
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
People, you know, die

197
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This special people

198
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Doing that

199
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And just

200
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It sounds strange, but

201
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Well

202
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
They do think about these things

203
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But it is also out of respect

204
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That you're not going

205
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Of course

206
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You know

207
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But apparently

208
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Tiff says it's just horrible to look at her

209
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh, you want to hear a really horrible story

210
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So finally now we have daycare

211
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Coming every single day

212
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Seven days a week

213
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So yesterday

214
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The dog wanted to go out

215
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
During the day

216
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And there was no one around

217
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And so my mom got out of bed

218
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And let the dog out

219
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No

220
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But then she couldn't get back to bed

221
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And she lay on the ground

222
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And was just screaming until the neighbor's heard her

223
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh no

224
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That is so sad

225
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Oh

226
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And I told her

227
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't mean to bum anybody out

228
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But I just got to get it out

229
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I just got to tell

230
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Oh, you have to talk about that

231
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I have to talk about

232
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Because I know that you just

233
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Sometimes don't want to talk about it

234
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That's the way you are

235
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But you should

236
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah

237
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You should

238
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You have to

239
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It helps

240
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And especially

241
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
To other people

242
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It doesn't matter

243
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If people want to hear it

244
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You have to do that

245
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Right

246
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And some people have the same experience

247
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh, so many people

248
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh, man

249
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So many people email me

250
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So many voice comments

251
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And voice males

252
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And they've all been to the same thing

253
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It is such a horrible disease

254
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And what's fucked up

255
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Is that in 20 years

256
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The daughter probably won't ever know about this problem

257
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
They're going to fix this

258
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
No

259
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah, I mean it's

260
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The human genome

261
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
This is ridiculous

262
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Isn't it?

263
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Well, just the technology is going so fast

264
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
They're definitely going to fix this

265
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But it's just like, wow

266
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's

267
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Well, that's what I'm saying

268
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You don't wish this on anybody

269
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Not anybody

270
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Not anybody

271
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Not even somebody

272
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You really, really hate

273
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's just horrible

274
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Right

275
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But it does tell me

276
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You know, if anything

277
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I think we need to learn a lesson from it

278
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Well, I already did it

279
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I know, but you're old and wise

280
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yeah

281
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm just learning

282
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yeah, because you know that

283
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
All the people always say that

284
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh, you have to enjoy

285
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Oh, you know this

286
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Well, it's not just enjoy

287
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I think it's ride the wheels off this mother fucker

288
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I think

289
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I think

290
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Ride that shit down to the fucking rims

291
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That's what you got to do

292
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Squeeze it out

293
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Squeeze it out

294
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Really

295
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Okay

296
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Anything you want

297
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay

298
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So, thank you very much, baby

299
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
For joining me on the show

300
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You're welcome

301
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You know, someone sent me something

302
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That is just so fantastic

303
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And it's so funny

304
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Because

305
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Like just a few minutes ago

306
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What is the first rule of the show?

307
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't talk about the show

308
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And it's so hard

309
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Because I get all these great bits

310
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
From people and I want to play

311
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And for you

312
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh, no, I don't want to do it

313
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Because I want your reaction

314
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
To be pure

315
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So you know little Britain

316
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah

317
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And lots of people who listen to the show

318
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Probably watch it in America as well

319
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So, what is one of your favorite female characters

320
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm a little Britain

321
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm just

322
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There could be couple of them

323
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Or maybe you

324
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Or one of them

325
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Or one

326
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Okay

327
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm a lady

328
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That one

329
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
No, no, that's

330
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm a lady

331
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You see

332
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
No, no, no

333
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Okay, listen to this

334
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
No, listen to this

335
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Graham Wilson sent this in

336
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Listen to it

337
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hi, Peter

338
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's Linda

339
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I have a presenter with me

340
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Once to know if he can miss the satellite window

341
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's Adam Curry

342
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Oh, you know Adam

343
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Long blonde hair

344
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's likely they can look

345
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Long legs

346
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Like to have sex with pies

347
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Very short penis

348
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Never actually met any of his friends

349
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Thought all of Bon Jovis old haircuts at a charity location

350
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's right

351
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The big head fag

352
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Okay, I'll tell him

353
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Peter upset you can

354
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Miss the satellite window

355
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But he'll have to do that Florida cop thing

356
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Be true to death with a baton

357
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Hahaha

358
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
How good is that man

359
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Hello, it's Linda

360
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So there's Linda character

361
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
She's a administrator

362
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
A administrator at a school

363
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And people, you know kids keep walking in

364
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
They're all different ethnic ethnicities

365
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And visual

366
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And they're asking features

367
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Right

368
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
She always calls and then insults

369
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
She's on the phone

370
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Exactly that man

371
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's cracking me up

372
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I love that

373
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Thank you dude

374
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I have so-and-so in front of me, and then she starts.

375
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,500
Hey, we have to say hello to your fan, dude.

376
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,700
Oh?

377
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,500
Rick?

378
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,400
I think it's Rick.

379
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,200
Was it Rick?

380
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,900
Yeah.

381
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,600
Who sent you the videos?

382
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,900
Oh!

383
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,700
From 1980 or 81?

384
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,700
Yeah.

385
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,500
OK, well, so make sure you thank him.

386
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm just reminded.

387
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,500
Well, thank you so much.

388
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,000
It was nice to see myself so skinny, so beautiful, and so...

389
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
With your Stevie Nicks dress and boots.

390
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Ah!

391
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That's pretty cool.

392
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No, actually no Christina and I were looking at it, and watching it, and...

393
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
No, she really liked it.

394
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Because all the things...

395
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And the songs were good, I like those songs.

396
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And if you live in, without you...

397
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah.

398
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But what?

399
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Some things...

400
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I just...

401
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's John Fkartweck, eh?

402
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

403
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Road to the lyrics, and he's a bit straight.

404
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Oh, dude.

405
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You know, there's...

406
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You know, K3, Goddry?

407
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah.

408
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
In...

409
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
They're from Belgium.

410
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
They have these huge hits.

411
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I mean, you know, those are huge hits.

412
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah.

413
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah.

414
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So the producers have another song.

415
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Not a K3 song, but some other...

416
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm not gonna knock him to say who, because they're also known.

417
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'd never heard of him, but they aren't known.

418
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And they want me to...

419
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's funny.

420
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
They want me to do a whole DJ rap thing,

421
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Void, not rap, but voice over.

422
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
No.

423
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
On it.

424
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah.

425
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And I said...

426
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And I listen to the track, and I'm like, wow, this is like 1,000% bubble gum.

427
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Said, but if you let me...

428
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Is that how much do you want to have for this?

429
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't want any money up front.

430
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So let's make it a hit.

431
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Put it on the pod save music network, and let me have a piece of it.

432
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah.

433
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So I'm thinking of doing that.

434
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The fuck.

435
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Oh, why not?

436
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yeah.

437
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yeah.

438
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
He did star sisters.

439
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That never hurt you.

440
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And I never got paid for that.

441
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So now's my time.

442
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's come around again.

443
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yeah.

444
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So no, it was very nice to see myself like that.

445
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You never...

446
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Haven't you haven't changed that much.

447
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You've become...

448
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
If anything more,

449
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
womanly in a...

450
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Raquel Welch kind of way.

451
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Well, you know, you're saying that because I was always so scared.

452
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm saying that because I want to get laid tonight.

453
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That's why I'm saying it.

454
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Oh, that's why.

455
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I have something behind it.

456
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But, you know, I was always so skinny.

457
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And I always wanted to look like Raquel Welch.

458
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And thought, oh, I wish I had hit.

459
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
She's not skinny, man.

460
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
She's pretty good woman.

461
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Uh-huh.

462
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I thought, I wish I had fools.

463
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I wish I had hips.

464
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Uh-huh moved.

465
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
and check check check check check check check check.

466
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I took me a while.

467
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So, after I got Christina,

468
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I started actually developing a little bit and became a woman.

469
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That's when I met you darling.

470
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
That's after you met me darling.

471
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Ah, she became a real woman.

472
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That's right.

473
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I taught you how to be a woman.

474
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You make me feel like it.

475
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That's your real woman.

476
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah.

477
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:16,800
Yeah, we suck. I mean, I do. I just wanted to say hi to Eric and Tonson. Adam just started listening to the podcast found your show.

478
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,000
It's great with interesting talk and music. I actually like, currently I'm in the US Army deployed in Iraq.

479
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Thought you might want to know that you have at least one soldier over here listening to.

480
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Oh.

481
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That cool. Also, I thought you might be in use to know that I referred to you as the podcast.

482
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Before I heard show 400, which explained you made the whole podcast thing appealing to the masses with your coding and heard your pod father bit.

483
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I came to my conclusion pretty much based on that I've heard your name mentioned like five of the podcast.

484
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Anyway, Eric and Iraq. Let me know where you are, dude.

485
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Where in Iraq? Where are you stationed?

486
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yeah, yeah. I'm very interested.

487
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah.

488
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's amazing that they're still there, actually.

489
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
At San Francisco Airport security looked at my passport, which is, you know, I have extra pages put into my passport.

490
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I've traveled so much. It's like a Bible.

491
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And I'm looking at Mr. Curry. What were you doing in Kuwait?

492
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh, that was just on my way to Iraq. What were you doing in Iraq?

493
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So, dude, entertaining the troops, my brother.

494
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yep.

495
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And then that was cool.

496
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yeah, that was really cool because you were the first one to go.

497
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Well, no.

498
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
No, no.

499
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's never really been done with the Dutch troops because it's not the culture of the Netherlands to do that.

500
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah.

501
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
When they talk about the troops, they do it. They de-personalize it.

502
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's not really people who are there. You know, it's just the troops.

503
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah. Well, they want them to stay serious.

504
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yeah.

505
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
They want to be entertained.

506
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
They want to be entertained.

507
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
They want to be entertained.

508
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But most of them are, they're all in Afghanistan now.

509
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
In dangerous situation.

510
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I got an email from Han H.A.N.

511
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Who is now ghost 13.

512
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That's his, uh, he flies the shenooks.

513
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yeah.

514
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Wow.

515
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
They're still flying over and waving.

516
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I know.

517
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Don't you love that?

518
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah.

519
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yeah. That is cool.

520
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah.

521
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Um, okay. What you got, baby?

522
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Oh, nothing special for, we saw a couple of houses.

523
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I showed you two houses yesterday.

524
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah. That was very interesting.

525
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Well, I thought, you know, you have to see them.

526
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I know it was not, you know, something that we would decide to buy.

527
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
But I thought you needed to see them.

528
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Well, this house was beautiful.

529
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The house was fantastic.

530
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It had beautiful property.

531
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's a Victorian from 1810.

532
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's my fantasy dream.

533
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But when they built it, 100 years ago, 200 years ago.

534
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yeah.

535
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The road that ran in front of it wasn't actually like the main drag.

536
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah.

537
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yeah.

538
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
But they hadn't sound proofed.

539
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It was, there was no double glazing or anything.

540
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And, you know, the cars were literally driving through the living room.

541
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It was amazing.

542
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And there's, there's, we still could do a lot with that house.

543
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But there's a beautiful garden.

544
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And what I said was, you know, I'm not even worrying about inside.

545
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But if you want to sit in your garden, you want to hear the birds.

546
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And the birds are not loud enough.

547
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yeah.

548
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The ones on the mopeds drive and buy are loud.

549
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Exactly.

550
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Now, you're never going to be able to fix the garden.

551
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't think so.

552
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You were really thinking, you know, what can we do?

553
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What I thought was, isn't there a way you can't you set up a whole speaker system

554
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
that puts the, like, a dome of, of, of silence over the property with the

555
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
property with, you know, you know, how you can make karaoke songs by putting the sound out of

556
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
the face.

557
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Can't we put the whole property out of phase and just phase out of this?

558
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It must be possible.

559
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
How high tech would that be if you could do that?

560
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It was so funny when you said that.

561
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
No, well, I've seen these booths that you couldn't pull down and it's out of phase.

562
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And then, and you're right.

563
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So I just don't know if you can do that with a, maybe, you know, strategically

564
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
space, place speakers that emit a certain phase or frequency.

565
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Someone out there's got to, got to have some research on it.

566
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What if it was actually possible, would you want to try it?

567
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Uh, no.

568
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What if you had a dial inside, you could say, okay, I want more birds.

569
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I want more.

570
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I win noise.

571
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I don't know.

572
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I, I'm also a bit worried about the fuse.

573
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Dude, you, you live with the few meister.

574
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The fumes.

575
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Well, you know, split fumes or, uh, flume, flumes, flumes, flumes?

576
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I have fumes from the buses.

577
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The fumes.

578
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
There's also buses racing by, so I don't know.

579
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But isn't in a pity.

580
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Yeah, really too bad.

581
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And then in the other house, we saw, which was, I mean, the price, it was high.

582
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Uh, but it was totally because of the location because it's literally fabulous.

583
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Uh, man.

584
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Views unbelievable.

585
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You're right on top of the high street.

586
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You look out over all of Gilford.

587
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yeah.

588
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Beautiful.

589
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But it was, it was such a piece of shit.

590
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I mean, I would know where to start.

591
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
No.

592
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And we, and we like fixing up old places.

593
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yeah.

594
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's, yeah.

595
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You've made two cheap, the materials were, two cheap.

596
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yeah.

597
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And there was, and there was some guy from Ghana living in the basement.

598
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah.

599
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah.

600
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Hey, can we take a look?

601
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
He's in bed watching the soccer match.

602
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yeah.

603
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's a great house for entertaining.

604
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And for guys from Ghana who watch football downstairs in the garage.

605
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah.

606
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah.

607
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Well, we, we had a chat with that all in order today.

608
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Um, who's the rental agent for, for this house for the cottage.

609
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yeah.

610
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And she was telling.

611
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Check now and then.

612
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
She's so into SNM.

613
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I can tell.

614
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
No.

615
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah.

616
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh, yes.

617
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Dude.

618
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Totally.

619
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
She's got whips and chains and letters.

620
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I can feel it.

621
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yeah.

622
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I can smell it.

623
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm telling you.

624
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
She's sweet.

625
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You dropped him.

626
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
She'll I get him this time.

627
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yeah.

628
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yeah.

629
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Okay.

630
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
No.

631
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
She's sweet.

632
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Yeah.

633
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yes.

634
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
She does.

635
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That's why you're thinking that.

636
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Dude.

637
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I know I know what the watch is.

638
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So how you doing now?

639
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's Linda.

640
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's, I don't know.

641
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Hey, let's do a full 49 minutes.

642
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Let's get the whole show on the on the satellite today.

643
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah.

644
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yeah.

645
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Is that possible?

646
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yeah.

647
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's possible.

648
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Or you just heard Linda.

649
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Linda said it was okay.

650
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
She'd check with people.

651
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yeah.

652
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah.

653
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Um.

654
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
But she was saying that the press had really hyped up.

655
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Yes.

656
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The housing market in January in February.

657
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
She said now it's really been tapering off and the prices are going down.

658
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
People are accepting lower offers.

659
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Because I said to you, what's going on?

660
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I mean, this is going too fast.

661
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You're looking on the internet.

662
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You see a couple of nice houses.

663
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And then a couple hours later, there's enough for on it.

664
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The next day, you know, every boy doesn't mean that it's sold.

665
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
No.

666
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I know that.

667
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
But you know, that's very interesting.

668
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Everybody was busy.

669
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It was very busy with it.

670
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yeah.

671
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And she says it's going to be more close.

672
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Excuse me.

673
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Sensei.

674
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So that was very interesting.

675
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And we'll just keep on.

676
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
How interesting.

677
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So we'll keep on looking.

678
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I guess that I played a song by Jeremy Row.

679
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
New pod save.

680
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
New artists, upload to the pod save music network.

681
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And he sent in to say the following.

682
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Hey, Adam.

683
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
This is Jeremy Row calling.

684
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I was just calling in regards.

685
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Say thank you for playing my song.

686
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And I'm very excited about this whole pod.

687
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Chasing thing.

688
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I want to thank Brian from Picasso cast.

689
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I think I said that right.

690
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
For playing my stuff and getting me turned on to it.

691
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Also people such as Jersey Todd.

692
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And the bucket and the switched and so on and so forth.

693
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I think this is a really great thing.

694
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's definitely different than doing a regular radio interview or anything with a radio.

695
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's great.

696
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's something that I hope we can.

697
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I hope this thing blows up like that.

698
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And like it seems to be doing.

699
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And yeah, it's just a great thing.

700
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm really excited about it.

701
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'll be posting more music up on.

702
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I will be guys call it the PMM anyways.

703
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Anyway, thanks again for playing in line to die.

704
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I hope people liked it.

705
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And I like to show it's excellent.

706
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I really appreciate it.

707
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It helps me a lot in getting my career off the ground.

708
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Thanks again.

709
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But see, this is what it's about.

710
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
My dad and God.

711
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And I want to thank all the people there that cheap seats.

712
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But that's what it's about, man.

713
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's I love this so much.

714
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's just, it's just, it's just a word.

715
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It is so fucking simple.

716
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The music business made it so hard and so complicated.

717
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And it's just so simple.

718
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
This is so simple.

719
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It really, you know, Michael Butler sent me the names of all the biggest established bands

720
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
who were on the podcast music.

721
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
No, it's like the 30 of them now.

722
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Even Marion faithful.

723
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
No, Marion faithful.

724
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Marion faithful.

725
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I hope she doesn't hear this, man.

726
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
That's like, that should be right off the podcast music network.

727
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
She is always so busy.

728
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
She loves it.

729
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
She's always making music.

730
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I like that.

731
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Like that lady.

732
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yeah.

733
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yeah.

734
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That's a good spirit.

735
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And you're trying to back.

736
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
No, no, no, no.

737
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
No, no, no.

738
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I like her.

739
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Okay.

740
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yeah, no, because I know we're from, you know,

741
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I don't really know work.

742
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I've never met her.

743
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
But I mean, I know her music.

744
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And he, are you ready to sign up for pod show plus?

745
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So you two can enjoy podcast at ease?

746
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Okay.

747
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Then go to podshow.com and you can pre-register now.

748
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Because, you know, I'm not saying the actual day,

749
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
but we're liberating our media very soon.

750
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It's starting.

751
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's starting.

752
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So if you wonder what I'm doing up until 130 in the morning,

753
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
it's talking to San Francisco.

754
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah.

755
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But man, it's going to be so cool.

756
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And so almost at the same time,

757
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
we're, you know, we're about to start launching

758
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
in the United Kingdom.

759
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's like when it rains, it pours.

760
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And so I showed you some of the video stuff that we're doing.

761
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So, you also saw that we want, you know, the billboards that we're thinking of.

762
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

763
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And stuff in the tube.

764
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So, yes, they, well last night,

765
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
we came up with an idea for a competition.

766
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
We want, I'm calling the tube chick competition

767
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
or tube dude because we need a girl and a guy.

768
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So, basically, we're going to be selecting, you know,

769
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
someone from the audience, one of the listeners,

770
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
and they'll be the poster boy or poster girl.

771
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Really?

772
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And they're in pain, of course.

773
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You know, it's like real, an official gig.

774
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So we're just looking for someone who's,

775
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I don't know, hot, cute, funny,

776
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
irreverent.

777
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I also need a mother.

778
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
A milk, yeah.

779
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
The tube milk.

780
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You know what that is, don't you?

781
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
No, milk.

782
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Do you know what milk means?

783
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Right, milk.

784
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Christina talks about all the time.

785
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
She always makes that joke.

786
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You never heard that.

787
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm a milk.

788
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And you.

789
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You were a total milk.

790
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Oh.

791
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Oh, I get it.

792
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You do?

793
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I think.

794
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It's an abbreviation.

795
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Oh.

796
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It's from the internet.

797
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It's like, if you go to a porn site,

798
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
you can look at, you know,

799
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and you, you know, oral and oral.

800
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It's about like 40.

801
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's a sort of mother.

802
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I get it.

803
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Yeah, you're on the right.

804
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Yeah.

805
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And there's also a category always known as milk,

806
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
which is mothers I like to.

807
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

808
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Got that one a couple of times.

809
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Yeah.

810
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yeah.

811
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
What do you think Christina's friends from school are always over here?

812
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah.

813
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
The boy friends.

814
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Oh, yeah.

815
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
When I'm, when I'm shopping, sometimes these kids come to me.

816
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And then they approach me.

817
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Oh, you're, you're Christina's mom.

818
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Oh, hi.

819
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Can I hug you?

820
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Of course.

821
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Well, of course.

822
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
They all saw you naked on the, on the internet.

823
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
They hug so much.

824
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Yes.

825
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
These days.

826
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Yeah, that's true.

827
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
That there is a definite hugging, hugging vibe going on.

828
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Yeah.

829
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Well, that's nice.

830
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
That's very nice.

831
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Better than beating each other.

832
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
People need to cuddles.

833
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I took Christina to school this morning, so I had to walk all the way in,

834
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
whether because I had to carry her bag and her art folder.

835
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And Miss Perry.

836
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
She was, she didn't even move out of the way.

837
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Bitch.

838
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Really?

839
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Yeah.

840
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I gave her the look.

841
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You gave her the look.

842
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Yeah.

843
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And then what's this guy's name?

844
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
The head of the 10th class.

845
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
He's also a gym teacher.

846
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Really nice guy.

847
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Yeah.

848
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
He's nice.

849
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
A little one.

850
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Yeah.

851
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Yeah.

852
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
But what do you like him?

853
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You're looking right in the eye.

854
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Yes.

855
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
He is of your, of your, of your,

856
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Statue.

857
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Mr. for 90, Mr.

858
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
No, no.

859
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Well, anyway, he was really nice.

860
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And, you know, he immediately introduced himself and helped Christina

861
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
sat her down.

862
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
He was very, you know, very concerned.

863
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
He's a good guy.

864
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Yeah.

865
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
He called me.

866
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Yeah.

867
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Right.

868
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Okay.

869
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So.

870
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Man, do I, you keep dropping?

871
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
What, you know, I've suggested a million times.

872
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I got to take a picture if you're trying to climb up on the stool.

873
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
That is just so cute.

874
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yeah.

875
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
What have to do with my life to do?

876
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You want to do something out of, out of your world?

877
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

878
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I was actually just checking the newspaper that you,

879
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
or do you buy every day for me?

880
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Mm-hmm.

881
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Mm-hmm.

882
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And no, I was looking.

883
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Which would be the sun or the mirror.

884
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I buy both of those for you, actually.

885
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Lots of pictures and gossip.

886
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Mm-hmm.

887
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And now I was looking at poor Madonna.

888
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Oh, what's going on?

889
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Mad.

890
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Mad.

891
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Maddy.

892
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It needs to sell her tickets.

893
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Not going very well.

894
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Is that really true?

895
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Mm-hmm.

896
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
How do you know?

897
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Well, because I've read it a couple of times.

898
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Oh, then it's true.

899
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Yeah, I think so.

900
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Well, why?

901
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Why not?

902
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Because whenever they write something about us,

903
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
it's never true.

904
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yeah.

905
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
But there's always a little bit.

906
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Dude!

907
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
But anyway.

908
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And then, so, of course, Alton.

909
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Don't swing the glasses.

910
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I don't want to have the people out like that.

911
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Alton had a comment this week and said,

912
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Yeah, who wants to see a show, you know,

913
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
somebody that's just lifting.

914
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And he just keeps on saying that.

915
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
He's such an old wife.

916
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Mm-hmm.

917
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yeah, because if you start to say that,

918
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
there's so many acts and groups and singers

919
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
that use, you know, more on the tape than...

920
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And you know what?

921
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And if he wins another Grammy, he'll go right up there and say,

922
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
thank you to the Grammys and to the Academy and all they represent,

923
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
while the same Academy gave Millie Vanilla a frickin' award.

924
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You know, it's like they're all hypocrites.

925
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Well, they didn't know what was going on, of course.

926
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Oh, but it's...

927
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's never...

928
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Everybody knew what was going on.

929
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
But it's not...

930
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I see, I'm not a great fan of...

931
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I'm not a huge fan of Madonna.

932
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You know that.

933
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Yeah.

934
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
But she works very hard, and she's a great entertainer.

935
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Yeah.

936
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It doesn't matter.

937
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It's a great entertainer.

938
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It works really hard.

939
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
It's a beautiful show.

940
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Mm-hmm.

941
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And she's not a great singer, but she says it herself.

942
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'm not a great singer.

943
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
You know, and sometimes quite...

944
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Dude, she's...

945
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Yeah.

946
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
She's cranking out the hits.

947
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But yes, she does.

948
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
She does.

949
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I do like her.

950
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I like her.

951
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And a lot of her music, I like her.

952
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yeah, so...

953
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
She works with all kinds of interviews.

954
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It's not fair, because so many acts are using...

955
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
You know, more music on the...

956
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
On stage, and...

957
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You know, you know that.

958
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Of course.

959
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And...

960
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Hello.

961
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I mean, we've seen...

962
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
We've seen Frank Sinatra.

963
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
He's not even there.

964
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You know what I mean?

965
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
He's so lip-sinking.

966
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
He's so lip-sinking.

967
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
He's so lip-sinking.

968
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You know what I mean?

969
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
No, but...

970
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You know, these days...

971
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
That's not what it's all about.

972
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Of course, you have lots of groups that just play.

973
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And that's...

974
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Do you remember when...

975
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
When the electric light orchestra...

976
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
When they had...

977
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
That's really what started a big controversy is when...

978
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Yeah, they were actually the first...

979
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Well, they had...

980
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Well, they had tapes.

981
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
They didn't even have synthesizers back then.

982
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So they had tapes, tape loops running, and stuff on stage, and something broke.

983
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
But you have to.

984
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
No, but then...

985
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And the broke...

986
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And it was a scandal.

987
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And ELO was fake, and they're no good.

988
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
No.

989
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
No.

990
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It was like, dude.

991
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I mean, people who are on stage...

992
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Shit, they have in the computers.

993
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I mean, half the stuff is not being...

994
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Well, I don't care even.

995
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Who cares?

996
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Who cares?

997
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Who the first one who used the cello...

998
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Cello, cello, cello, cello...

999
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
What do you mean?

1000
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Like more than one cello?

1001
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Ch-ch-ch-ch-elos.

1002
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
That's a word.

1003
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Ch-elos, violins.

1004
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I mean, they didn't have that in the band.

1005
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So they used...

1006
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
The strings.

1007
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Yeah, the strings.

1008
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Popularly known as the strings.

1009
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
That was very good.

1010
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And then...

1011
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Do you remember...

1012
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Do you remember...

1013
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
We saw...

1014
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Who's that song?

1015
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Ba...

1016
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And then...

1017
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
My glasses and his...

1018
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm telling you the shakers, dude.

1019
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Hey, my glasses...

1020
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
His...

1021
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
In excess.

1022
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
In excess.

1023
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Remember we saw...

1024
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
At the B-Con Theatre, that's right.

1025
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
We were just in New York.

1026
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
The first hit...

1027
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Remember the first hit...

1028
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
But that was not there for...

1029
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
No, no, no, no.

1030
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
That was not...

1031
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It was the first U.S. hit.

1032
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And it was...

1033
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
We went to concert.

1034
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yeah, I'm telling...

1035
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I said the B-Con Theatre...

1036
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Yeah.

1037
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I know the whole thing.

1038
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And it took us...

1039
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It was the B-Con Theatre in New York City.

1040
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And it was...

1041
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Love you, too, night.

1042
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And the whole drum track was exactly that.

1043
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And we were looking around and we were looking...

1044
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
We were like, how...

1045
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Everything sounds like shit except for the drums.

1046
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I did tell them you said that...

1047
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
That's not them.

1048
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Yeah.

1049
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You know, there was so clear.

1050
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
But so...

1051
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And so why?

1052
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You know?

1053
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Hey, dude, you made a big mistake.

1054
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
What?

1055
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You made a big mistake.

1056
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Do you want to hear about it?

1057
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yeah.

1058
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Hello, Adam.

1059
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
This is Phil from the Afrikaans in Sydney podcast.

1060
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Over at www.Afrikaansinciting.com.

1061
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I wanted to...

1062
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I think this audio comment.

1063
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And just to give you a correction on a common misconception.

1064
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You seem to have recording the language spoken in South Africa.

1065
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
A tutor referred to as...

1066
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Sait Afrikaans.

1067
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
The language, which is my mother tongue, is called...

1068
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Afrikaans.

1069
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Just that.

1070
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Not Sait Afrikaans or South Afrikaans.

1071
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Just plain Afrikaans.

1072
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It's a mixture of Dutch and German.

1073
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And the time I spent in Belgium made it fairly easy for me to converse

1074
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
with Dutch and German people speaking there.

1075
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Although the pronunciation is different,

1076
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
it could manage to get along if it didn't speak about slower.

1077
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
What's even more amazing is the amount of Afrikaans

1078
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
spoken outside of South Africa.

1079
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah.

1080
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Even in Sydney, Australia, my own podcast is a platform for all Afrikaans

1081
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
speaking less than that in Australia.

1082
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
So far, I think the Afrikaans podcast and community of about

1083
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
20 podcasts worldwide are the only group to come up with their own

1084
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
translation of the word podcast.

1085
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Namely.

1086
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Potroy.

1087
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Which is a well-except term for the Afrikaans podcast in community.

1088
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Potroy.

1089
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Potroy refers to friends coming together, having a nice meal,

1090
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and sitting and enjoying it as a company.

1091
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And then having sex.

1092
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
You can find all the other Afrikaans podcasts over at www.potroy.org.

1093
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Potroy.

1094
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Potroy.

1095
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
That is pout.

1096
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Sait Afrikaans.

1097
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Potroy.

1098
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Adam Bayranki Friedwerke.

1099
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It's a very famous music from the Afrika.

1100
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Thank you.

1101
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Potroy.

1102
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I did hear some Belgium.

1103
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
It sounds very Belgian doesn't it?

1104
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Yeah, that's interesting.

1105
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
But a whole bunch of people from South Africa sent me that.

1106
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
They're really offended.

1107
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Almost offended.

1108
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I don't know.

1109
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So it's Afrikaans.

1110
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
What we learned?

1111
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Afrikaans.

1112
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
We should go there.

1113
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
But they all speak English.

1114
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
That's why I've thought.

1115
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
All they're saying is, it's not South Africa.

1116
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It's like saying, you speak English or South English.

1117
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Yeah.

1118
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But what is the exact, the exact language?

1119
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Afrikaans.

1120
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Is it English or is it Afrikaans?

1121
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Oh.

1122
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
You mean what is the primary language?

1123
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Yeah.

1124
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
What's the primary language in the United States?

1125
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
That would be Spanish.

1126
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Not English.

1127
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Oh.

1128
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
But I figure South Africa, let's just say, Afrikaans is the primary.

1129
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Very good English.

1130
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
So I don't get it.

1131
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Well, there are countries in this world.

1132
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Like the Netherlands as an example, where people speak the mother tongue and they speak English.

1133
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Now, but that's what I mean.

1134
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
What do they call Afrikaans?

1135
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
What do you mean?

1136
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Is Afrikaans that sort of Dutch?

1137
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Yes.

1138
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
That's the language.

1139
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
That is the first language.

1140
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It's not a dialect, baby.

1141
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It's their language.

1142
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Yeah.

1143
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
But so it's the Dutch kind of language.

1144
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Well, yeah.

1145
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Otherwise their language would be called English.

1146
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Because I also thought that way.

1147
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
You've died that hair.

1148
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Yeah.

1149
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:28,000
So what I thought was South Africaans was maybe the Dutch side.

1150
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And Afrikaans was maybe the English.

1151
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Exactly.

1152
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
So this is the misconception.

1153
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
In South Africa, they speak Afrikaans.

1154
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Afrikaans.

1155
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And other places in Africa.

1156
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Afrikaans.

1157
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Afrikaans.

1158
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And now a word from our sponsor.

1159
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It's the Yanks.

1160
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Versus the Brits.

1161
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
We'll drive each other crazy.

1162
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
But everybody knows that it's apparent to see.

1163
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Let's just like you and me.

1164
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
It's the Yanks.

1165
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And the Brits.

1166
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
The Yanks.

1167
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Versus the Brits.

1168
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Mind the gap.

1169
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Jeff is working on our jingle for the show.

1170
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
A commissioned him.

1171
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Okay.

1172
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
The Yanks.

1173
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Versus the Brits.

1174
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Just got to do two quick segments.

1175
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Is about this football and football and soccer and all that stuff.

1176
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Hey Adam.

1177
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Dave from Dave's football blog here again.

1178
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I had to respond to this comment from Tuesday's Charlie.

1179
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Your boy Casey said.

1180
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
So thank you.

1181
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
He has been kind of, um, you know, pushed the soccer thing on his this year until, uh,

1182
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
crazy.

1183
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
American football starts.

1184
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
The real football.

1185
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Right.

1186
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Right.

1187
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Now, let me preface this by saying that nobody digs the NFL more than I do.

1188
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I mean, who else do you know that would go to a different sports bar every Sunday during the season?

1189
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And live blog is favorite teams games using a trio 650.

1190
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Well Richard Bruer.

1191
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Hey from Pod Show might be one of those people.

1192
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
That said.

1193
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
What makes the NFL real football?

1194
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
More real than college football or Canadian football?

1195
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
More real than association football?

1196
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
More real than Aussie rules football?

1197
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
These are all man-made games with man-made rules.

1198
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
And those rules keep changing and evolving over time.

1199
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Think about it.

1200
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Where would association football be if the Cambridge School's fair catch rule were more popular in the

1201
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
1850s?

1202
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Where would American football be if Walter Camp hadn't replaced the rugby scrum with the

1203
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Scrimmage in the 1880s?

1204
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
For that matter, where would rugby football be if not for William Webb Ellis?

1205
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
The original rugby bugger.

1206
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Who caught a football on the rugby school pitch one fateful day in 1823 and thought,

1207
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
you know what?

1208
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I'm tired of all this kicking rubbish and he took off running down the field,

1209
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
touching the ball down inside the goal, prompting all of his classmates to say,

1210
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Bloody hell.

1211
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
What is that stupid get doing now?

1212
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
We've invented a lot of football games in the last 200 years and you know what?

1213
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And the next 200 years will invent a whole lot more.

1214
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
The bottom line is that football is meant to be played on foot with a ball.

1215
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Go back centuries and you'll see that rich people in royalty played their ball games on horseback.

1216
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Got forbid they get any actual exercise.

1217
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
But the common folk played their ball games on foot.

1218
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And not always with just their feet.

1219
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
That's why we connect with all these different games because no matter what rules we make,

1220
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,000
football always was and always will be a game of the common people.

1221
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
By the way, I just went to godaddy.com and registered Dave's football history.com

1222
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
We're only 699 using the code DSC3.

1223
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Keep an eye out for something they're soon.

1224
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And Casey, Carolina is not a city or a state.

1225
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Carolina is a state of mind.

1226
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
A state of mind that says,

1227
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I'm Dave and I'll see you at the next kickoff.

1228
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Dave's got a great voice.

1229
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
We should use them for some stuff.

1230
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Very clear.

1231
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Yeah.

1232
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I think.

1233
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Now I'm going to be in trouble.

1234
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I think that.

1235
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Talk into the mic, baby.

1236
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
The European football.

1237
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Well, you mean the world football?

1238
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Yeah.

1239
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I think that that was the first football.

1240
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And I think it looked more like rugby when they really started.

1241
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Well, I know you don't listen to the show, but we've actually been through a lot of that.

1242
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You're right.

1243
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
It is.

1244
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And this is the whole thing.

1245
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I guessed it.

1246
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Yeah.

1247
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,000
The soccer was made up at Oxford University when they called it association football.

1248
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Yeah.

1249
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And then it was soccer and soccer.

1250
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
We went to that whole thing.

1251
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Your friend podcast ball has a comment too.

1252
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Uh-huh.

1253
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Hello there.

1254
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Adam, it's Paul here.

1255
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And I'm just been listening to your deadly source code on Tuesday 27th.

1256
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And I heard some Blake from Texas talk about the football.

1257
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Wasn't a very viewer friendly game.

1258
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Is it mental?

1259
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
It's mental.

1260
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
It's mental.

1261
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
The whole menu.

1262
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Okay.

1263
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
At the moment are absolutely in a frenzy, including elderly grannies and young kids.

1264
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
That's so true, isn't it?

1265
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
This country has gone nuts over football.

1266
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Nuts.

1267
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Yeah.

1268
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Everyone loves it.

1269
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Uh-huh.

1270
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
They are glued to the screen whenever England is playing.

1271
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I'd just like to say that I try to get into American football and baseball.

1272
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And just was just completely bewildered.

1273
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I went across to Louisville a couple of years back with a friend of mine.

1274
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And we watched a basketball game which I really enjoyed.

1275
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Anyw after three minutes.

1276
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Ah.

1277
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
These tumblers that came on and banned parading around and things.

1278
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
My mates and I just looked at each other with their maths open.

1279
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
They tug off.

1280
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Then the blakes come back and prepare for four minutes.

1281
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Then pull off.

1282
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Hahaha.

1283
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And then the thing.

1284
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
What?

1285
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And then they peep at the middle end.

1286
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Then I'll think it was the first quarter.

1287
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And then after three quarters, everybody just gets up and goes, but it wasn't even four quarters.

1288
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I, I, I need to be honest, um, it's probably Yanks versus the Brits Certiopsection comment.

1289
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
But, um, do Americans have a short sort of attention span?

1290
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Yes, yes.

1291
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Yes, yes.

1292
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Dude, totally.

1293
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
We've been in short.

1294
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Yeah, that's the way you win.

1295
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Yeah, that's the way you win.

1296
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
You flash flash flash go go go.

1297
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
If there's no entertainment.

1298
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Dude, we are so far.

1299
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
We have completely made entertainment.

1300
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,000
You've made entertainment into a science, and exact science.

1301
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And all those sounds, I was out wrong.

1302
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
That really did.

1303
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Yeah, they did, yeah, they did, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1304
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
It's also American football.

1305
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It's rugby with blokes dressed in quilts.

1306
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
If you need a lot of good subjects, games, Christmas games...

1307
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Watch your camera rugby.

1308
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Some guys came across here from Luv Mill.

1309
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I love them.

1310
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
watching an international game and they actually said to me, is this legal?

1311
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
So many.

1312
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,000
If you want to watch a good World Cup series in next year, over in France, you've got the rugby

1313
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
World Cup and that really will be something to watch.

1314
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I enjoy football but I absolutely love rugby.

1315
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I'm making football and baseball.

1316
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Haven't got a club.

1317
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I've tried to get into it, can't understand it.

1318
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
All the tumbling around and girls, very short skirts.

1319
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
That's wrong with that too.

1320
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
We're going to entertainment.

1321
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Anyway, that's one comment.

1322
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
See mate, that's why.

1323
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Thank you Paul.

1324
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I go afterwards to the pub.

1325
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
That's why we invented cheerleaders man, because the games got boring.

1326
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
We've got all these innings and halftimes and quarters.

1327
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Bring out the chicks.

1328
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Quick entertainment before they leave.

1329
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Rugby, you have to be real man.

1330
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Oh yeah.

1331
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Oh yeah.

1332
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Oh yeah.

1333
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
The Wayne Rooney looks like a rugby player, doesn't he?

1334
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Wayne Rooney is a steam engine.

1335
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
He looks like a steam engine.

1336
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
He looks like a steam engine.

1337
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
He shows his bomb everywhere.

1338
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
He's like, I scored everything.

1339
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
He's funny.

1340
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I'm so happy that you're into this, because we've never really been into any sport together

1341
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
for any reason.

1342
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Yeah, whatever.

1343
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm in a different country.

1344
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Different world.

1345
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Your husband is a dentist.

1346
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Yeah.

1347
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Chocolate warm.

1348
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Life.

1349
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Without her flank.

1350
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Hello.

1351
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Hello.

1352
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Hello.

1353
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Does anybody see my ASP?

1354
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I haven't got any friends.

1355
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
How?

1356
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Adam?

1357
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Adam?

1358
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Get Earth Link.

1359
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
You lose him.

1360
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
This is the new ad challenge.

1361
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It's going great.

1362
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
You, the ads are so different than what we all.

1363
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
That's what I like about it.

1364
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
That's what we're doing.

1365
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Yeah, it's like, yeah, I like it.

1366
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
There's so much crazy.

1367
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Very aggressive.

1368
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Very progressive.

1369
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You guys think I'll tell you what?

1370
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
No, actually no.

1371
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Nothing.

1372
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I follow.

1373
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I follow.

1374
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I follow.

1375
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Throws the paper on the ground.

1376
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Yeah.

1377
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Well, big brothers getting pretty excited.

1378
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
This is what I want to say.

1379
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
It's just a follow with a little bit and what it idiots.

1380
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It's funny, though.

1381
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
It's in the United States big brothers.

1382
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
They're so strange.

1383
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I'm a human being.

1384
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Believe me.

1385
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
This is the beauty of the show.

1386
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
This is the beauty of the show.

1387
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
It's great.

1388
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But we haven't seen any.

1389
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Have we seen any sex?

1390
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Yeah.

1391
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
No.

1392
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
They're very totally sexless.

1393
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
No, of course.

1394
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
We always see people throwing up.

1395
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Yeah.

1396
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I'm going up.

1397
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I'm going up.

1398
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I don't know how they do it, actually.

1399
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
All those guys.

1400
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
They need something.

1401
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I know what you mean.

1402
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Yeah.

1403
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Oh, those guys.

1404
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Yeah.

1405
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I did a pod save the queen yesterday with Christina.

1406
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Yeah.

1407
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Which was hilarious once again.

1408
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I'm not stopping her.

1409
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Her audience will tell her when she goes too far.

1410
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
She's easy.

1411
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
She's really easy to say the pikey words and stuff like that.

1412
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
And she doesn't really.

1413
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Well, she'll find out what what how people misinterpret things.

1414
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
So easily.

1415
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Particularly when they listen to a show.

1416
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Or when they listen to you and write it in your article.

1417
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Oh, yeah.

1418
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Totally.

1419
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Yeah.

1420
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
No, I mean, if it was really bad, then it's not.

1421
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
You should learn.

1422
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I think she'll learn.

1423
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
It's going to be a learning experience.

1424
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Yeah.

1425
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Well, they said on TV yesterday about big brother also, the big effort.

1426
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Yeah.

1427
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
They use it.

1428
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So all the time.

1429
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
All the time.

1430
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
They don't even think anymore.

1431
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
You know, they don't know what they're saying anymore.

1432
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Because they use it.

1433
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
It's just as a, what is the word for it?

1434
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
And so it's sort of...

1435
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Oh, um, stop for it.

1436
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Yeah.

1437
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I don't know.

1438
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
It's like saying, um.

1439
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Yeah.

1440
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Yeah.

1441
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Yeah.

1442
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And I said to Christina, do you talk like that?

1443
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
You know, to your friends?

1444
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
She said sometimes.

1445
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Sometimes.

1446
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Sometimes.

1447
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I said, it's so.

1448
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Maybe I'm old fashioned, but coming out of a woman's mouth, you know.

1449
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And you know, I say a lot.

1450
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Dude, we are so lucky with this kid.

1451
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
She's a good kid.

1452
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
She's a good kid.

1453
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
She's a good kid.

1454
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
And she never says it at home.

1455
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
She doesn't use the word.

1456
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
No.

1457
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
No.

1458
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
No.

1459
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
But I don't know.

1460
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I cannot get you to it.

1461
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
What?

1462
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
What?

1463
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Maybe you should say it now and then.

1464
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
That's necessary.

1465
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Absolutely.

1466
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Yeah.

1467
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So what I'm leading up to is she played a song on her show, which I want to play today.

1468
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
It is so funny.

1469
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I played some mood for you yesterday.

1470
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
But just listen to the whole lyrics.

1471
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
You're going to crack up.

1472
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
It's Adam and Andrew.

1473
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And they're from they only have a mice base.

1474
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Say.

1475
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Okay.

1476
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And they're looking for a record label.

1477
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
And I hope they put the stuff up in the podcast music network.

1478
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Everyone should be playing this.

1479
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
This is the emo kid.

1480
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Dear diary, mood, apathetic.

1481
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
My life is spiraling downward.

1482
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I couldn't get enough money to go to the club.

1483
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
They'd run math and suffocate me dry concert.

1484
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It sucks because they play us in my favorite songs.

1485
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Stab my heart because I love you.

1486
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Probably part of my soul.

1487
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Of course.

1488
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Stab your lips.

1489
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Stab.

1490
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
And it doesn't help that I couldn't get my hair to that floaty thing either.

1491
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Like that guy from that band can do.

1492
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Some days and no.

1493
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I'm an emo kid.

1494
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Nothing forming as can be.

1495
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
You'd be nothing forming too if you look just like me.

1496
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I have pain in my nails and make it on my face.

1497
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I'm almost emo enough.

1498
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I'm just dark shaving my legs.

1499
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Because I feel real deep.

1500
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
When I'm dressing in drag.

1501
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I call it freedom of expression.

1502
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
No, it's just call me a bag.

1503
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Because they're dudes that look like chicks.

1504
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
They're chicks that look like dykes.

1505
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Because emo is one step below.

1506
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Transvestite.

1507
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Stop my fucking ass that my pro.

1508
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I must be emo.

1509
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I don't jump around when I go to show.

1510
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I must be emo.

1511
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I'm dark.

1512
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And sensitive with those of the steam.

1513
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
The way I dress makes everyday feel like Halloween.

1514
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I have no real problems but I'd like to make believe.

1515
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I stole my sister's mask here and now I'm grounded for a week.

1516
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Soking and writing poetry or my hobbies.

1517
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I can't get through a hollown heights up and without sobbing.

1518
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Goes keep breaking up with me.

1519
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
It's never any fun they say they already have a pussy.

1520
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
They don't need another one.

1521
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Stop my breathing ass that my pro.

1522
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I must be emo.

1523
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I don't jump around when I go to show.

1524
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I must be emo.

1525
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Dying my hair and polish on my toes.

1526
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I must be emo.

1527
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I play guitar and write suicide notes.

1528
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I must be emo.

1529
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
My life is just a black abyss.

1530
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
So dark.

1531
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And it's not forgetting me.

1532
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Cracking the holes for me and tidying it straight.

1533
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Tired of the pair of little sister's jeans.

1534
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Which looks great on me.

1535
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
When I get depressed.

1536
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I cut my wrists in every direction.

1537
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Hearing songs by getting dumped give me an erection.

1538
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I write in a live drill and where I think we're in blasts.

1539
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Like, oh my friends, I bleed black and cry during blasts.

1540
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I'm just a bad cheap imitation of God.

1541
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
They're getting me catcher in the right.

1542
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And watch me jack off.

1543
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I wear skin tight clothes.

1544
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
While hating my life.

1545
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
If I set I like girls.

1546
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I'd only be half right.

1547
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I look like I'm dead and just like a homo.

1548
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I must be emo.

1549
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Screw Xbox.

1550
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I play old school Nintendo.

1551
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I must be emo.

1552
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I like to wind and hit my parental's.

1553
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I must be emo.

1554
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I must be emo.

1555
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Me and my friends all look like clones.

1556
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I must be emo.

1557
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
My parents don't get me now.

1558
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
They think I'm gay just because this is all me kiss a guy.

1559
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Well, a couple guys.

1560
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
But I mean, it's a 2000s.

1561
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Can't two or four dudes make out with each other without being gay.

1562
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I mean, chicks dig that kind of thing anyways.

1563
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I don't know, Dari.

1564
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Sometimes I think you're the only one that gets me.

1565
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
You're my best friend.

1566
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
That is so fun.

1567
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I feel like tacos.

1568
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I feel like tacos.

1569
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
That is so funny.

1570
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
That's great.

1571
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Now I wonder, you know, the emo is now.

1572
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
The guys who are emo.

1573
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
The kids who are emo.

1574
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:57,000
So what kind of kids were they when we were young?

1575
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Were they the silk socks that we golden?

1576
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Translated.

1577
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
If you remember.

1578
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
If you want to hear the rest of this particular conversation,

1579
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
you have to go to dailysourcecode.com.

1580
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Because we are now hitting the extended side light window.

1581
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Yeah.

1582
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Pacific Coast, how is next?

1583
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1584
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Yeah.

1585
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Okay.

1586
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
In Dutch, we say, say, sok.

1587
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Everybody had those in your class.

1588
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
What did we call them when I was young?

1589
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Before they came to their nails.

1590
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Before they died the hair.

1591
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
They didn't fall on the face.

1592
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
In front of their eyes, you know.

1593
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Oh, we call them blitz.

1594
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Blitz.

1595
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Yes, they were blitz.

1596
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
They were the blitz kickers.

1597
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
No, no, no, no.

1598
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
In my time.

1599
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
My time.

1600
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
No, no.

1601
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
In the century after you.

1602
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
These are not guys that were the super guys in school.

1603
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
No, no, no, they were losers.

1604
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
These were the, you call them the blitz guys.

1605
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
They were losers.

1606
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
They were super super nerds.

1607
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Yeah.

1608
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Yeah.

1609
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Well, I was one of those.

1610
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
We were Scott.

1611
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Yeah.

1612
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
You always choose something.

1613
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
If you were.

1614
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I was Scott dude.

1615
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
A guy like that.

1616
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
The pointy shoes.

1617
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Check her tie.

1618
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
You know, you, you were actually looking for something.

1619
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
So that people would look at you, actually.

1620
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Do you think that's it?

1621
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Or I just wanted to belong to something.

1622
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Yeah, belong to something.

1623
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
So that people would look at you and, and you get attention.

1624
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
That's the only way to get attention.

1625
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
No, man.

1626
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
It was about the music.

1627
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
It was all about.

1628
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Yeah.

1629
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Yeah.

1630
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Yeah.

1631
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I was Scott.

1632
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I had the pointy shoes.

1633
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I had the checkered tie.

1634
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I had the, the funnel pants.

1635
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Yeah.

1636
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I look so hot.

1637
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I was never into that.

1638
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Yeah.

1639
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I was the artistically.

1640
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Oh.

1641
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I was in the black t-shirts.

1642
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Yeah.

1643
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I called those those.

1644
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Turtle neck.

1645
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Turtle neck.

1646
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
And also tight pants.

1647
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Mm-hmm.

1648
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
And.

1649
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Oh.

1650
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Oh.

1651
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
That's a great.

1652
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
That was a great reading.

1653
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Great poem.

1654
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
No.

1655
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
That was fantastic.

1656
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Yeah.

1657
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
And later I was the rock chick.

1658
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
So I just kept on dressing in black.

1659
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Yeah.

1660
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Black still.

1661
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
You had a bitch in black.

1662
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I'm still a very, very, goth.

1663
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Goth.

1664
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
You're black again.

1665
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Yeah.

1666
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I'm always there.

1667
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I have my velvet coat.

1668
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I'm walk around in the house.

1669
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Oh.

1670
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
That's a goth thing.

1671
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
You're, you're, you're the OG.

1672
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
The original goth.

1673
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
The old goth.

1674
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
There you go.

1675
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
The OG.

1676
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I guess.

1677
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
All right.

1678
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Well, let's stop now while it was still funny.

1679
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Yeah.

1680
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Good idea.

1681
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Thank you.

1682
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Thank you.

1683
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
That was, that was very.

1684
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Yeah.

1685
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Was it cathartic?

1686
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
It was a good for you.

1687
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It was dude.

1688
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
It was so good for me.

1689
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
You should listen to the show once.

1690
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
No one was pretty funny.

1691
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
You just want to say.

1692
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Yeah.

1693
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I've heard about it.

1694
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Yeah.

1695
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
But I got you the whole day.

1696
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
So you're pretty funny.

1697
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Oh, thank you.

1698
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Maybe we should stick around each other for a while.

1699
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Yeah.

1700
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Stick in each other for a while.

1701
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Okay.

1702
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Later.

1703
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
After I talked to Ron on the conference call.

1704
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Ah.

1705
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Ah.

1706
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Ah.

1707
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
You're ruining my marriage.

1708
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I have no sex anymore.

1709
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Hey.

1710
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Ah.

1711
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Mr. Bloom.

1712
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
That's a blue.

1713
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
You're ruining my sex life.

1714
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Someone hurts me.

1715
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
There's more of Mr. Bloom than me.

1716
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Well, he is quite attractive.

1717
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Yeah.

1718
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Oh.

1719
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Yes.

1720
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
How is it, actually?

1721
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Okay.

1722
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
That's enough.

1723
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
All right, baby.

1724
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Thank you very much.

1725
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Shall we have some lunch after I put the show up in all that crap?

1726
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I don't know.

1727
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
You're going to go do your nails.

1728
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I'm going to do your nails.

1729
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Yeah.

1730
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I love that it's you.

1731
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I'm going to get that a cure.

1732
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
To massage my feet and my arm.

1733
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
How that is.

1734
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
large.

1735
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
It's porn.

1736
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
It's beautiful.

1737
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It's porn.

1738
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:59,560
Well, you like my feet nice and soft and, yeah, yeah, I'm not a foot guy actually, but of course I like a man who wants a woman with ugly feet.

1739
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,560
No, no, that's a turn-off.

1740
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,040
Not very attractive, no.

1741
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,040
I have nice feet.

1742
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,040
You do.

1743
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,040
They're big.

1744
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,040
Big toes.

1745
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,040
Yes.

1746
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,040
You know what they say?

1747
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,040
Yeah, don't stand on them.

1748
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,040
That's what they say.

1749
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,040
All right.

1750
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,040
I love you, honey.

1751
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,040
Love you, too.

1752
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,040
