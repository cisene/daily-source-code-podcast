more from the Kuri cockpit and skies above, wherever Adam might be.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is episode number 42 with Adam Kuri.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass,

39
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,040
It's all okay, so don't worry about me

40
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,040
Cause I can cheer and find a way to make you feel alright

I think I'm ready

46
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,040
I think I'm ready, I think I'm ready

47
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,040
I think I'm ready, I think I'm ready

48
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,040
I can't just see how we all run down here

49
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,040
I'm flat to me, so I'm gonna make you risk to me real

50
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,040
You think it's all okay, cause you can see the light

51
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Life and death, through the days that I get straight to the night

52
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:52,040
You think it's all okay, so don't worry about me

53
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,040
Cause I can cheer and find a way to make you feel alright

54
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,040
It's all okay, so don't worry about me

55
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:10,040
I think I'm ready, I think I'm ready

56
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:28,040
You think it's okay because you can see the light

57
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:34,040
Lock it in, do the days when I can't sleep in the night

58
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:41,040
You think it's okay so don't forget about me

59
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Cause I'm gonna chill and find a way to make you feel alright

60
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
Make you feel alright

61
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,040
Oh yeah

62
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,040
Make you feel alright

63
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,040
Yeah

64
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,040
I make you feel alright

65
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,040
That's what I'm talking about

66
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,040
Bang tango

67
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,040
It's all okay

68
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,040
From the pod save music network

69
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,040
Dude

70
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,040
Good to hear from those guys again

71
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,040
Bang tango

72
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
Late 80s

73
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,040
I think late late 80s

74
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,040
Somewhere in a box

75
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,040
I have a bang tango leather jacket

76
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
I think I have it

77
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,040
I might have given it away at one point

78
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
I don't know

79
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
I had so many leather jackets

80
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,040
I was like my thing for a while

81
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,040
Everyone would give me these awesome leather jackets

82
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
Jeff Hamilton

83
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
He's still around

84
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
Make leather jackets

85
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,040
He's one of the most beautiful others

86
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
Bang tango

87
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,040
On the pod save music network

88
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
Everybody how you doing

89
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,040
It is a very, in fact it's so sunny

90
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
There we go

91
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,040
We're gonna pull the shade down here

92
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,040
In the Curry condo studio

93
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,040
Beautiful day in San Francisco

94
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,040
Which of course is typical

95
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,040
It's the last day that I'm here

96
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,040
I'm feeling actually pretty damn good

97
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,040
Which is also typical

98
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
I'm seeing everyone

99
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,040
I'm seeing them dropping like flies now

100
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
This freaking flu

101
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,040
And it's a rough one

102
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,040
It's one of those where you get a throat ache

103
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,040
You get stuffy, you get a headache

104
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Your body starts to ache

105
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,040
People are just dropping left and right

106
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,040
With this crap now

107
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,040
So if you feel it coming on

108
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,040
Get some of that

109
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
What is that shite

110
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,040
That everyone told me I should take after it was too late

111
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
The airborne

112
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
That's right, airborne

113
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,040
I guess I'll pick some up for the trip back

114
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,040
I think now I'm immune for the bug

115
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,040
Foo bar Friday

116
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,040
If you're new to the show

117
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Foo bar stands for fucked up beyond all repair

118
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,040
And when you hear the stuff that you guys have made

119
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,040
And sent in today

120
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,040
You're gonna feel like you're a part of the Foo bar

121
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
Festivities for sure

122
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,040
Thanks to young pull-out by the way

123
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,040
For the opening of today's program

124
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
A nice generic one

125
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,040
I can use it anytime

126
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Just let me lay down kind of

127
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Not, well I would take ground rules

128
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,040
But just basic premise for an opening

129
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,040
I love it when you send me different openings for the show

130
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
And if I have more than one

131
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
I just play them all

132
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
You know, I love them

133
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,040
They're short, they're funny

134
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,040
It's not a plug opportunity

135
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,040
A lot of people heard my call the other day

136
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
And yesterday and said

137
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

138
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,040
We're gonna send them an opening for the show

139
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
And then it starts off like

140
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,040
Hey, this is so and so

141
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,040
From the so and so podcast

142
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,040
That's not how I want to start my freaking show

143
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,040
You know, if you send me something

144
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,040
And you know, something that I can use on the show

145
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,040
I'll plug your stuff

146
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
But just send that separately

147
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
Don't put it into the opening

148
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,040
It just doesn't work that way

149
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,040
Oh shoot, yes

150
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,040
It's Friday

151
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
Amy Mac

152
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Here to shape up my ass

153
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,040
Before I go home

154
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
So Patricia can

155
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,040
Adam

156
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,040
Yes

157
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Amy Mac

158
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,040
Amy could meet up for another live show

159
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,040
But as you were returning to San Francisco

160
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,040
I was heading home to Nashville for a few days

161
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,040
Not a problem, honey, bud

162
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
What do we got going?

163
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
Like sighted, it's always good to be home

164
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Even if it is just for a few days

165
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Not here

166
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
I know what you mean, I want to go home too

167
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
But anyway

168
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,040
I was flipping through a fitness magazine on the plane

169
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
And found today's move

170
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
Oh, okay

171
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
What's today's move?

172
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,040
So good, I'm excited

173
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
Alright, I'm ready

174
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,040
However, it does require a prop

175
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Oh shoot

176
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
What?

177
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
What do we need?

178
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
Do you have a chair handy?

179
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Uh, you hold up

180
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
A kitchen or desk chair would work fast

181
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Oh my god

182
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,040
I got myself all situated

183
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,040
Wait a second, Amy, I'll take off my bathroom

184
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
Okay

185
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Ready?

186
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
Yes, what am I doing?

187
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Good, now stand facing the back of the chair

188
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,040
Uh, okay, let me smooth the mic

189
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,040
Take your left leg over the right side

190
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,040
And swing it over the chair

191
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
Bring it back down to the left

192
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
What?

193
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Back to the back

194
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,040
Now the right leg goes to the left

195
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
And swings over the chair

196
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,040
Oh yeah, I feel that already

197
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Okay, now alternate back and forth

198
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Eight times

199
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Yes, eight times

200
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Let's hear you count

201
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Go

202
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
Try not to use too much momentum

203
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,040
Really control that leg that flies over the chair

204
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,040
For bonus, squeeze the stomach too

205
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,040
Are you breathing?

206
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
Yes

207
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,040
You can keep your hands fisted

208
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040
And close for stability

209
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,040
But number you want

210
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,040
Keep it strong, don't whip out

211
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,040
This is a whole lower body workout

212
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,040
So you should feel it in your butt, legs, stomach, and your heart

213
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
And your heart rate should be off to the races

214
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,040
All right, great job

215
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,040
Remember, if you need a mattress course

216
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,040
Ask hercise.podshow.com

217
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Launches on Tuesday the 24th and starts with day one

218
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,040
Yes, thank you Amy

219
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,040
All right, this is Amy Mack

220
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
And until next time

221
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,040
Thank you so much

222
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,040
Oh, Amy

223
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,040
That was kind of fun

224
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,040
I have a rather high back chair

225
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,040
I have

226
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,040
Of course I have long legs, but oh man

227
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,040
That was a

228
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,040
That's a real workout there

229
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,040
Okay, put the bathroom back on

230
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,040
Oh, don't worry

231
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,040
I had

232
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,040
I had

233
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,040
Other clothes on underneath

234
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,040
You don't have to be too grossed out, okay?

235
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,040
I was not sick, I just got to catch my breath

236
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,040
I had been a very ill man, you know

237
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,040
Takes a second here

238
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,040
Okay, let's check the phone lines

239
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
265-6357

240
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
Put a plus one in front of it

241
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
If you want to be able to reach that from anywhere

242
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
In the world from your mobile phone

243
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,040
Plus one two one

244
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,040
265-6357

245
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,040
People talking about some stuff

246
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,040
Hi Adam, so it's just a very windy

247
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
And traffic just picked up a bit

248
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
I took all of that

249
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
Listen, Spender

250
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,040
Okay, look fun, you're going to get yourself some

251
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Okay

252
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,040
And the time you haven't used someone so far

253
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,040
I respect that, that's a real good

254
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,040
I'm sure Bill Hitch wouldn't have approved

255
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,040
But hey, he's dead

256
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,040
So

257
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,040
You've got people floating in now

258
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,040
I'm a massive fan of diet coke

259
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,040
But I have to say it's really not good for me

260
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,040
And I hope in the one day I will find out

261
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,040
That I'm not shooting blanks

262
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,040
And they'll have to have some kids

263
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,040
But if you have diet coke and you're adding

264
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,040
Another fake sweetener

265
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,040
What I'm telling you is it can someone else me that

266
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,040
And they've been health system

267
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,040
On this sweetener

268
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,040
That are independent of the manufacturer

269
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,040
I'm just curious

270
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Initiatives are really good products

271
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,040
Then I might end up investing in it myself

272
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,040
Let me tell you something

273
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
I love that product

274
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,040
I really do

275
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,040
We have it at the office

276
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,040
And we have

277
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,040
Hazelnut in the French vanilla

278
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,040
For some reason we don't have

279
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,040
All three flavors

280
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,040
But I have

281
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,040
Particularly now that we have had this

282
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,040
We have one of those copper chino machines

283
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,040
Where you put in

284
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,040
If you want to make copper chino, you have to put in a

285
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,040
Creamy packet first

286
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,040
And then you've got to put in the espresso packet

287
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,040
After that and we were out of the creamy stuff

288
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,040
So that's kind of what makes it

289
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,040
Part of the taste with this particular coffee machine

290
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,040
So I spent some time yesterday

291
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,040
Mixing up the

292
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,040
French vanilla

293
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,040
And the Hazelnut

294
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,040
And it kind of gave me on a regular

295
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,040
Cup of coffee, it gave me a

296
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,040
almost like a pseudo-copuccino taste

297
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,040
Which is kind of nice

298
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,040
I do have a complaint though

299
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,040
We have the

300
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,040
The long

301
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,040
Splendip packets, which are

302
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,040
The kind you'd probably see

303
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,040
In a cup at a restaurant

304
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,040
The long thin ones like a tube

305
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,040
I can't get these freaking things open

306
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,040
I literally wind up using a knife

307
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,040
Two times out of five to get this packet open

308
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,040
I know there are other packets that

309
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,040
It comes in but I don't know if this is the

310
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,040
Industrial size or the enterprise version

311
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
But I just can't get them open

312
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,040
I just can't get them open

313
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,040
The old confused me don't French vanilla

314
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Why is it what's French about vanilla?

315
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,040
Why is it called French vanilla?

316
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,040
You know the US

317
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,040
How shut up?

318
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,040
It's not so safe

319
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,040
You know what I do

320
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,040
I have a friend across the pond

321
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Call it French vanilla

322
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,040
I guess someone did want to know

323
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,040
Everyone does

324
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,040
Any road

325
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,040
I don't know

326
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,040
I would sell you on a folder

327
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,040
But I already told you

328
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,040
And

329
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,040
I guess I'll just sign up with any of the

330
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,040
I'm

331
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,040
I know who this is then

332
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,040
PW biggest fan sure I know who you are

333
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,040
Yeah, that's a very good question

334
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,040
I have no idea why it's called French vanilla

335
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,040
I'm sure someone out there has an idea why

336
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,040
Yeah, why isn't vanilla

337
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,040
Is more something for the

338
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,040
Coco producing companies I would say

339
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,040
And the vanilla producing companies

340
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,040
Contra companies countries

341
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,040
I have no idea

342
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,040
French vanilla

343
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,040
Well, I'm sure there's some history to it

344
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,040
I'm sure there's plenty of coffee drink

345
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,040
Because out there who can help us

346
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Okay, so this morning I woke up

347
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,040
I was really really excited

348
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,040
I saw an email from Carmen Tyler

349
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,040
With an attachment

350
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,040
Now, of course, we know who Carmen Tyler is

351
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,040
She is the former Miss Louisiana beauty queen

352
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,040
And she has a couple of songs

353
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,040
And the positive music network of players

354
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,040
Several times on this show

355
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,040
And of course, I've been known to ask her for naked pictures

356
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,040
And so when I see an email from Carmen Tyler show up

357
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,040
With an attachment, you can imagine

358
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,040
I was like, I think I'm just going to lay in that a little bit longer

359
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,040
And open up this email and see what

360
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Because that's what I prep my show in bed

361
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,040
Like 6 a.m.

362
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,040
Let me see what Carmen is sending

363
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,040
Oh, this would be perfect for Fubar Friday

364
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,040
And well, it wasn't a picture

365
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,040
But it was this

366
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Hey, this is Carmen Tyler

367
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,040
And I have no idea what I am doing

368
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,040
So I'm trying to do podcasts

369
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,040

370
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,040
Bring on the Velcro

371
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,040
I don't have ADD

372
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,040
I just get bored releasing

373
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,040
And my brain goes in million different

374
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,040
Corrections at one time, which is just absolutely crazy

375
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,040
No one wants to be inside my head

376
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,040
Oh my god

377
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
That is so crazy

378
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,040
I can't believe you just said that

379
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,040
M-Y-N-K-A-S-T dot putshow.com

380
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,040
Carmen Tyler doing a podcast

381
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,040
Welcome, girl

382
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
Welcome

383
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,040
Fantastic

384
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,040
The Carmencast

385
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
I love it

386
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
And you've got the voice for it

387
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,040
And I love the

388
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
You know the promo

389
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,040
I was rocking out

390
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
Fantastic

391
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,040
Love it

392
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,040
I'll be sure to put a link in the show notes

393
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,040
The Carmencast

394
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,040
Yeah

395
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,040
Early in the week I told you that New York State is after me

396
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
Has it worn out for me?

397
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
Not from my arrest

398
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,040
I don't think I haven't heard back yet

399
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,040
From my lawyers

400
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,040
Yeah

401
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,040
You know the kind of lawyers where you got to send a big check first

402
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
They're trying to get back taxes from me

403
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,040
Which would be interesting since I already proved to them

404
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:09,040
Four years ago that I haven't lived in New York since 1987

405
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,040
And I think I've paid all my taxes since then

406
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,040
So of course I was kind of curious

407
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,040
If anyone knew what's going on with New York State

408
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
And oh yeah

409
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Oh yeah

410
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
You've been tracking the IRS

411
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
I haven't been working in New York

412
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,040
And I just didn't know about these New York State tax guides

413
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
They're so desperate that they go sit down

414
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,040
And enjoy these shopping malls

415
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,040
And try and collect sales tax

416
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,040
That happens every year

417
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
It's Christmas

418
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,040
Crunchy

419
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Bahamburg

420
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,040
Yeah

421
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,040
And I think they're just they are over zealous

422
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,040
Yeah, it's good I guess

423
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,040
We don't want people evading taxes

424
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,040
It's just a little tiresome when I have to keep proving that I don't live in New York

425
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,040
And I've not lived in New York and don't own New York anything

426
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
Yeah, when it comes to taxes

427
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
I own New York a lot

428
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,040
But not money for taxes

429
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,040
I'll keep you updated on that

430
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,040
I'll keep you updated on that

431
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,040
Played that Jason Calacanis imitation of me yesterday

432
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,040
Oh man that really sets in people

433
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,040
Come extra

434
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,040
Come extra

435
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,040
Come extra

436
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,040
Come extra

437
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
Come extra

438
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,040
Hi Adam

439
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,040
I see that Jason Calacanis is keeping your ass

440
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,040
So let me tell you about this piece of scum

441
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,040
He not only posted lies about me on his blog

442
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,040
But he also stolen my comic strip

443
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
Remove copyright from it

444
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,040
And play stayed on his server

445
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
Furthermore

446
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,040
Stilling is repeating pattern in life of this Bastard

447
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,040
Jason Calacanis

448
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,040
Some examples

449
00:16:54,040 --> 00:17:00,040
Why Jason Thif Calacanis claims that paper post is wrong

450
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,040
He said it was from an gadget

451
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Accepting bribes from Microsoft

452
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,040
And I have proof of it

453
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
Wow

454
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,040
Come extra blogger

455
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Them's fighting words man

456
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
Hold on a second

457
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,040
He's a thief

458
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,040
He steals content

459
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,040
I've heard you complain about that before

460
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,040
I have heard you complain that he took one of your comic strips

461
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
And hosted it on his own server

462
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,040
And took out your copyright

463
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,040
But what he's saying he takes

464
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,040
And gadgets taking bribes from Microsoft

465
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,040
I mean

466
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,040
I guess that would be to put in stories about their stuff

467
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,040
And you have proof

468
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,040
I say bring it on out

469
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
Bring the proof out

470
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Come extra blogger

471
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,040
Jason Calacanis never did anything himself

472
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:51,040
He just steals other people's content and ideas

473
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,040
Like it is with sitting content in the case of an gadget

474
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,040
That is destroying blogger's fear

475
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:02,040
And many other web blogs of the web blogs in component that now is owned by AOL

476
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,040
He's destroying the blogger's fear

477
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Jason Calacanis

478
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
I had no idea

479
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,040
You're so evil

480
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,040
He is sitting also other people's ideas

481
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,040
Like it is in the case of Netscape

482
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,040
With money of our always trying to kill dick.com

483
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,040
I got to stop you there

484
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
CSB come on man

485
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,040
That's not stealing an idea

486
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,040
That's improving upon an idea

487
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,040
That's what the world is built on

488
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,040
Is building on other people's ideas

489
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
He didn't steal it

490
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,040
I got a disagree with you there

491
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,040
But I do like the fact that you're laying into him like that

492
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,040
Jason Calacanis is a crook on many levels

493
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,040
And he was and is destructive to blogosphere

494
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,040
I understand Adam that you need to keep contacts

495
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,040
Jason Calacanis for business reasons

496
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,040
But please take into account that he is not a good guy

497
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,040
That he pretends to be

498
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,040
And fuck you Jason Calacanis

499
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
So bye Adam

500
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Strawberry Kerry

501
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
Yo

502
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:11,040
I hope Jason responds with an audio comment

503
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:16,040
For someone who doesn't like being called a stalker

504
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,040
CSB

505
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Yo you got some pretty harsh words

506
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,040
A crook criminal

507
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,040
I like Jason Calacanis

508
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,040
I'm sorry I can't help but I don't know him as a crook

509
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,040
That's for sure

510
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,040
I know him as a guy that we've butted heads against a lot in the past

511
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,040
But I got a big a great amount of respect for this guy

512
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,040
And I don't think he's a crook

513
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,040
And I do think he has worked

514
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,040
Very hard to get to where he is

515
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,040
But CSB

516
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,040
You're always out there on the edge man

517
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,040
Always out on the edge

518
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,040
Oh

522

Oh yes

523
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
No

524
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,040
Oh

525
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
Are you going to come?

526
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,040
No, not yet

527

Oh

Or did you rip that from some porn movie?

555
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,040
Because she sounded really hot too

556
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,040
That was very good

557
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,040
I actually kind of got a lot of

558
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Tingle out of that

559
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
I think I'm going to be able to make it

560
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,040
It looks like I'll be in the UK

561
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,040
And yesterday we had a

562
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,040
A meeting with

563
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
Or the

564
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Marketing Department with podpimp

565
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,040
And I know there's a couple of

566
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,040
Sponsorship packages available

567
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,040
And we're going to sponsor the podcastcon

568
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,040
I really hope I can come

569
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,040
But I think it is a good initiative

570
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,040
It seems like a very grass roots type of thing

571
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Kind of semi-organized

572
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,040
And the last minute they're pulling together some

573
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
Sponsorship stuff

574
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,040
And so podshow is definitely going to try and help out

575
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,040
And if it's shit

576
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,040
We want to because we're entering into your market

577
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
Yeah

578
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,040
Put a little bit of bread in your pod

579
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,040
A little bit of yank in your Brit pod

580
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Speaking of which

581
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,040
This Saturday evening

582
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
At midnight

583
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,040
On Channel 4 in the UK

584
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,040
The Digital Music Awards 2006 airs

585
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,040
And I'm on the show

586
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,040
With Ron we present the award for a best podcast

587
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Now we went through this before

588
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,040
We weren't really a part of the nomination process

589
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,040
And there was a whole bunch of mainstream

590
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,040
Podcasts that have been nominated

591
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,040
And one independent one

592
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,040
No, I guess I shouldn't give it away

593
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
That they won, huh?

594
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,040
Because you got to watch tonight

595
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,040
But the show was on tonight

596
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,040
Midnight and what we're doing

597
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,040
Since the show was taped a couple weeks ago

598
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,040
And we did the whole red carpet

599
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,040
We're going to rerun the entire

600
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,040
It's like six hours of red carpet

601
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,040
Of just all the stars

602
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,040
The sea lebrides, the d-lebrides

603
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,040
And the e-lebrides coming in the door

604
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,040
We had Olivia

605
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
On the red carpet

606
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
We had max roaming around

607
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,040
By the bar area, we had OJ

608
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
Doing interviews

609
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,040
You know, it almost gets into a fight

610
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,040
With totally boy band

611
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,040
It's a very funny to watch

612
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,040
It's a great stuff

613
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,040
And we're going to rerun that

614
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,040
Let's see starting

615
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,040
12 noon

616
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,040
At BTpodshow.com

617
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,040
So go to BTpodshow.com

618
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040
At 12 noon on Saturday

619
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
UK time, which would be

620
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
Was it?

621
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
That's 4am here in San Francisco

622
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,040
And we'll be rerunning the entire red carpet

623
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,040
Extravaganza

624
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,040
Multi-camera shoot

625
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,040
All stream and all live, baby

626
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,040
And then we're going to rerun it

627
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,040
Again at six

628
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,040
And as I said, it's about six hours

629
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,040
That'll take you right up until

630
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
The actual awards started

631
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,040
So it's kind of funky, you know

632
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,040
It's like a delayed live event

633
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Which is really the only way we could do it

634
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,040
We don't control the television broadcast

635
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,040
But we did have a shitload of fun

636
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
Doing the red carpet event

637
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,040
So BTpodshow.com

638
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,040
To check out the red carpet arrivals

639
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,040
Of all of the C-Lebodies, D-Lebodies

640
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,040
And E-Lebodies

641
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
That's great

642
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,040
People from like big brother in the UK

643
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,040
And celebrity love island

644
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,040
And we kind of

645
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
We have fun with them

646
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,040
We take a bit of the piss out of them

647
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,040
But there's also Peter Gabriel

648
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,040
So it's

649
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,040
And the only interview he did

650
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,040
Was for the show

651
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:24,040
What else was I going to say?

652
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,040
Yeah, folks on this series

653
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,040
You're going to miss this really

654
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Horny Call I have

655
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,040
And aren't you lucky that you subscribe

656
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
To the podcast?

657
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,040
I could not believe my luck

658
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,040
When this came in yesterday

659
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,040
This next phone call

660
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,040
It's something that I've been

661
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
Wanting to happen for

662
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,040
Let me see, let's just say

663
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,040
I've been thinking about this

664
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,040
For 482 episodes

665
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,040
I've always said

666
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,040
You'll really know

667
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,040
That podcasting has broken through

668
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,040
And that we can really do something

669
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Do some real damage to the media landscape

670
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,040
When producers of podcasts and other independent media

671
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,040
Can get laid off of this stuff

672
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,040
I think

673
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,040
I'm getting very close

674
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,040
Listen to this

675
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,040
Hi Adam

676
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,040
This is Desell and San Diego

677
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,040
I have a confession to make to you

678
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,040
Kind of new to podcasting

679
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,040
And a friend of mine who's all into it told me all about your show

680
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,040
I was getting bored with everything on my iPod

681
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,040
So I thought I'd give it a try

682
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,040
These sides

683
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
You're kind of cute

684
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,040
So I figured what the hell, right?

685
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,040
So one day I was sitting at home on the couch

686
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,040
Reading a magazine

687
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
Listening to the SD

688
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,040
And at first I was kind of bored

689
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
But then something clicked

690
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,040
I started to key into the sound of your voice

691
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,040
And it really started sounding extremely sexy

692
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,040
And the next thing I know I'm touching myself

693
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,040
To the sound

694
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,040
Let me just say for that moment

695
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
For a second

696
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
I just got to rewind that

697
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
Hold on

698
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,040
I want to make sure that you hear it

699
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
Say it again

700
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Remely sexy

701
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,040
And the next thing I know I'm touching myself

702
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,040
To the sound of your voice

703
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,040
I've never been a voice person before

704
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,040
But I got this picture in my mind

705
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,040
If you're talking to me right in my ear

706
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,040
All of a sudden I was fantasizing

707
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
You were inside of me

708
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,040
I know that's kind of graphic

709
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
But there's something about the sound of your voice

710
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,040
So now I'm completely addicted to your show

711
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,040
And to your voice

712
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,040
Adam Curry you're one sexy bastard

713
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Oh yes

714
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
Folder

715
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
Oh

716
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
And she's a folder

717
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,040
Was her name?

718
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,040
Isel

719
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,040
Let me just see

720
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,040
Was her name gazelle?

721
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
When it was

722
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,040
Hi Adam

723
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,040
This is gazelle in San Diego

724
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,040
Gazelle in San Diego

725
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
Okay

726
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,040
Guys

727
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,040
You may not want to listen to this

728
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
Some guys might

729
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,040
Gazelle

730
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,040
I really really love that comment

731
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
And

732
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,040
I think maybe you should tell me what kind of things you want me to say to you

733
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,040
We could

734
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,040
You know try and experiment

735
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,040
Where

736
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,040
You have a fantasy about something I'm going to say

737
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
And then I say it

738
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,040
And then while you're listening you know you can really enjoy the Chacha

739
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,040
Oh

740
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
Man

741
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
Man

742
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,040
That's hot

743
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Send me more

744
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,040
Please I beg of you

745

BOD, BOD, is that from the BOD is in the body?

If there were, go back and listen again, if not, continue with the next dialogue.

833
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,740
Alright, I got to come up to Ireland.

On my way, ladies.

00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,740
And the only substitute that should be on your table, well that should be Splenda.

841
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,740
But listen, I've been on trial this whole week.

842
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,740
I've been in all these different courts.

843
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,740

She's literally a turpentine power to people

880
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:24,740
Suppressing a more hopelessness, she's registered to see her

881
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:31,740
To cliff-hanging in your waiting on the seagull

882
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:35,740
She lets you overlapped, but she won't let out

883

And she'll pay you no money

00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:59,740
No shoes, poison but you take a shot

890
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:03,740
She's just the egg with no heart

She'll make you wait on that

913
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,400
You sure?

914
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Yeah, you know it, right?

00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,400
Especially because you got paid back late from nightcourt

927
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,400
Let me just see a couple more things

928
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
Before I go

929
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,400
Oh, I wanted to mention Jeff Smith's day job

930
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,400
He's doing a video show

931
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,400
Which you can find at

932
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,400
What's it?

933
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,400
Shhh, Jeff's day job

934
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
And that's G-E-O-F-F

935
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,400
Jeff's dayjob.podshow.com

936
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,400
You got to see this

937
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,400
You know he's a working musician

938
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,400
He's a traveling pianist

939
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,400
Does the crazy pianos

940
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,400
And he's the the most recent episode I saw

941
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
Which I think was episode

942
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,400
You know she don't know

943
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,400
I don't know which episode it was

944
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,400
He had this whole audience

945
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,400
You know, yellow

946
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,400
Whether they were a folder or a scruncher

947
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,400
It's really cool

948
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Excellent. I'll put a link to that in the show

949
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,400
No today and see what else

950
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,400
Russell, what did Russell say here?

951
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,400
Adam, please stop comparing a power book G4 with a new dual core

952
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,400
PC

953
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,400
It isn't a fair comparison. I have a MacBook Pro

954
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,400
And the screen is beautiful and it is fast

955
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,400
I use both windows

956
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,400
You know what?

957
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,400
I would agree with you there

958
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,400
That's not a fair comparison

959
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,400
You know, but I did buy the power book

960
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,400
You know, within the past year

961
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,400
You know, so and look how quickly that got outdated

962
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
That's really angered me

963
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
Particularly after that when it broke

964
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,400
And

965
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
As a magazine called RAPUP

966
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
RAPUP

967
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
And they're also doing a show now on the podcast

968
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,400
Network, the pod show podcast delivery network

969
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
RAPUP.podshow.com

970
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,400
Let's see

971
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,400
What do they have?

972
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,400
They've got like a music video shoot

973
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Did they have on on their first episode

974
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,400
RAPUP.podshow.com

975
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,400
You definitely should look at that

976
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,400
And keep your eye on the

977
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,400
You know the podshow.com homepage

978
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Lots of video stuff happening there

979
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
And you'll see a lot more happening in the next couple weeks

980
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,400
And of course

981
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,400
Tomorrow night we have the red carpet event

982
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,400
From the digital music awards

983
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,400
So

984
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,400
That said, it's time to wrap things up

985
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,400
What day is it today?

986
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
It's Friday

987
00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:03,400
Well, final thought of the week

988
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,400
It's no secret that I really really love living

989
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,400
In the United Kingdom

990
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,400
I love everything about the folks there

991
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,400
We love the area that we're in

992
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,400
But I guess my final thought would have to do with the United States of America

993
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,400
And if you look at the news

994
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,400
You kind of get the idea that

995
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
It's all messed up over here

996
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,400
And that everyone is kind of

997
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,400
The country is

998
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,400
No one's at the helm, no one's steering this big ship

999
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,400
But that's not really true

1000
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,400
When you get down, and of course the same is for

1001
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,400
Civilizations and populations all over the world

1002
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,400
You can't really take what you see on the news

1003
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,400
Face value, it's just all messed up over there

1004
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,400
People don't know what they're doing

1005
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,400
One thing I have to say about the United States

1006
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
That I really really really love

1007
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,400
And it's been shown to me

1008
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Time and time again during this past trip

1009
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
The past two weeks

1010
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Is the work acumen

1011
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,400
The drive that people have

1012
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,400
We have about 60 people now at our office in San Francisco

1013
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,400
And we've got people in New York, we've got people in London

1014
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,400
But particularly what you see here in the US

1015
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,400
People just want to get shit done

1016
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,400
They really really do care

1017
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,400
There's no sense of

1018
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,400
I had never had to ask anyone to stay late

1019
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,400
To do extra work, they're doing it

1020
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,400
They've been at the office for two hours

1021
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
People love showing up early

1022
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
Just to get the stuff done

1023
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
Because they really believe in what they're doing

1024
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
And I should almost have some kind of patriotic

1025
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,400
Stars and stripes on going on the background here

1026
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,400
But it really really is true

1027
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,400
The way people like to work in America

1028
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
I know it doesn't

1029
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
It can't compare to any other country in the world

1030
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
And I'm really proud to be in America

1031
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400
And when I see that, you know, there is nothing

1032
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
And that's probably the big secret of the United States

1033
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,400
There is no problem that we don't feel we can't fix

1034
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
And we know that at the end of the day

1035
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
It's going to be all right

1036
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
And we are going to fix it

1037
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
And we are going to make it all right

1038
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
And we're going to correct our ways if we have to

1039
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
And we're going to work hard to get to where we want to be

1040
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,400
As a country and as a people

1041
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,900
I'm really sure about how much we can help

1042
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,400
Ok, great

1043
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,400
I really deserved to keep my passport now

1044
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,400
Don't I

1045
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,400
I myself

1046
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,400
I'm not going to do anything

1047
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,400
I think that's what we appreciate

1048
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,400
Alright

1049
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,400
Yes

1050
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,400
That's it for Fubar Friday everybody

1051
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,400
Thank you very much for listening

1052
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,400
Hope you have a great weekend

1053
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
Of course today I'll be back on

1054
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,400
The Lady Patricia has promised us

1055
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,400
Drupai and we eat a lot to discuss

1056
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,400
A lot to catch up on for show

1057
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,360
all the great sex we have during the weekend, which I'm also shooting here's going to happen.

1058
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,880
Adam with Curry, Adam at podshow.com or dailysourceco.com for all the show notes.

1059
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,920
Have a great weekend everybody. Bye-bye.

1060
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,400
I love it.
