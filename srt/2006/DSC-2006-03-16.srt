Delta Sierra Charlie 3-5-4 Hello, welcome to my underground layer.

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:20,160
I brought you all my 12 deadliest allies here today to discuss my plan for taking over

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,160
the world.

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,440
Realizing that there are millions of computer users in the world, my plan is to create

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,320
software that everyone uses, but is frustrating at times to use.

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:40,000
In each year, I will rule out new versions, promising stability and satisfaction while integrating

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,240
software with other products that I create, therefore creating a monopoly for users

8
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:54,280
around the world that will have no choice but to give me money, time, and time again.

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00,560
Yes, number two that Sierra has already happened, Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:06,040
has continually put out computer operating system that is at times frustrating, and Microsoft

11
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:12,000
has also been investigated for abusing their monopolistic powers.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,520
All right then, plan B. As you know, millions of people all over the world have been purchasing

13
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,720
iPads and downloading music for their enjoyment.

14
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,400
I wish to make downloadable content freely available to these legions of podcast owners that

15
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,200
content will be so enchanting and entertaining that the drones will become my slave army

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,120
and do my bidding and I will take over the world.

17
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,920
What number two?

18
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,120
Surer that two has already happened.

19
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:55,720
Sometime during 2004, a man named Adam Curry and others created a medium called podcasting

20
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:01,000
that is very popular and lots of people listen to his podcast.

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Craypes, why didn't anybody tell me this?

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I need the info.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Don't be a boon here.

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,280
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

25
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,880
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

26
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,440
I like to think I'm flying into this jar.

27
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
Adam Curry.

28
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,320
You never moved on without me.

29
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,720
Maybe one day we'll see things the same.

30
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,320
Feelin' sorry, I ever felt this way.

31
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:59,480
Feelin' sorry, no one else to play.

32
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,480
Yeah.

33
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:13,680
Time of my sight and a couple of dreams that no one understands for me.

34
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:35,720
Feelin' fine with me is sad for dreams and no one understands for me.

35
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,240
I've never saw it coming.

36
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:47,680
I expected it to be somehow.

37
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,560
Feelin' sorry, I ever said I can't.

38
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:10,880
Feelin' fine with me is sad for dreams and no one understands for me.

39
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:24,240
Feelin' fine with me is sad for dreams and no one understands for me.

40
00:04:40,880 --> 00:05:02,560
Feelin' fine with me is sad for dreams and no one understands for me.

41
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:24,960
Feelin' fine with me is sad for dreams and no one understands for me.

42
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:51,080
Feelin' fine with me is sad for dreams and no one understands for me.

43
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,720
From Florida, Burman and no one understands good morning, everybody.

44
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,240
It is the daily source code coming to you from Northern California, from San Francisco here

45
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,080
in the Cori condo, I thought I'd share another beautiful San Francisco sunrise with you.

46
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,960
Not sure if we're gonna have one today, what is it time here?

47
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,120
It's 6.31 in the morning and once again, I've gotten my ass out of bed to share the

48
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,360
Podsafe tunes with you and all the crap that's going on.

49
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,600
Big day today at Pod Show HQ, our Board of Directors are coming up to our place this time

50
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,680
around for our Board of Directors meeting and let me ask you a question.

51
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:32,720
If you had invested close to $10 million in a company that creates Podcast, would you listen

52
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,960
to their shows?

53
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,600
Would you check them out?

54
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,560
I mean, even on your way to the Board of Directors meeting, do you think that it would be

55
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,560
a smart idea to just listen and see what one of the founders is doing on his Podcast?

56
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,840
Well, my friends were going to test that.

57
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,440
The special Board of Directors, word of the day, is frog.

58
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:58,560
So those guys better be coming in and better be going ribbit ribbit, no one I mean.

59
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
Let's see.

60
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,400
Oh, there is so much to talk about, but I also have a lot of stuff that I will metro section

61
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,440
a moment on today's show, I've been saving up some bits for that.

62
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,120
I was going to say, oh, yeah, yesterday we had a great meeting with British Telecom.

63
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,120
This was great.

64
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:20,280
I told you the Muckity Mucks Rawl in town and boy, were they all the British Telecom broadband,

65
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:28,760
the CEO, and the CTO, and the CIO, and the president of retail sales, and it was really,

66
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,800
they were in some kind of, I'd have to say, they were really in a working meeting and

67
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,360
we were invited to come over and talk.

68
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,680
And we did just that and we kind of walked into a room full of, you know, how it's almost

69
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,520
like one of those board rooms where they're working on some huge merger or takeover

70
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,240
everyone's in short sleeves and there's pizza boxes everywhere and it's kind of, it's

71
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,680
a little bit smelly as well, like kind of old socks smell.

72
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,400
Well, that was exactly the room we walked into, but there was a lot of energy, a lot of

73
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,920
smarts and a lot of good thinking going on there.

74
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,000
And they didn't sign us to any non-disclosure agreements or, you know, as we say, NDAs,

75
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
no damage announcements.

76
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,040
I'm just going to respect that we opened our kimono as a little bit to each other.

77
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,560
You know, we didn't, not completely, but just a bit.

78
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,760
And wow, they're doing something really interesting.

79
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,880
So I have very high hopes for for user-generate content in the United Kingdom, which

80
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,320
is really freaking convenient because I live there half my life.

81
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,840
Sometimes it seems like less than half my life, but wow, stuff to do.

82
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,840
So I would say that's very exciting news for the UK podcasters.

83
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,680
And I guess we're going to meet next, not next week, the week after next, when everyone's

84
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,680
back in the UK and continue the conversation.

85
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,120
So as I can, I will keep you up to speed as best as possible.

86
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,800
Okay, those of you new to the show, it could be that you're listening to this on serious

87
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
stars 102.

88
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,560
It could be that you're listening to this podcast for the very first time.

89
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,480
It could be that you're saying, huh?

90
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,080
Metro sexual moment, huh?

91
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,480
What is this guy talking about?

92
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:10,160
Hi, my name is Happy, and I live at bedtime stories my kids love.

93
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,400
Once upon a time Adam asked for some frequently asked questions to be covered for the ever

94
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,760
growing daily source code audience.

95
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,080
The whole point is he's saying that people who come into the daily source code who are

96
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,880
newbies probably don't understand a whole bunch of things you're talking about.

97
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,480
And even though I do try to reiterate very briefly before I start off on a rant or

98
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,840
a story, it seems that the the main things that are, you know, that need some explanation

99
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,400
or that we need an FAQ or a cheese would be great to have an audio FAQ, wouldn't it?

100
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,880
I got to think about that.

101
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,920
Well, newbies, let's start with the basics, the Charlie.

102
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,880
It all started when listeners started calling the Daily Source Code, the Charlie, which was

103
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,080
the shortened version of Delta Shira Charlie, which are the call letters for Adam Curry's

104
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
plane.

105
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:01,400
Start out as the Daily Source Code, then the DSC, then Delta Shira Charlie, and now the Charlie,

106
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,520
not the Chacha, or the Chuck, or a nickname for your never regions, just the Charlie.

107
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,280
This is Happy, and I'll see you later with more Charlie, frequently asked questions.

108
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:24,040
Oh, the go first, thank you very much, kids, I love it.

109
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,480
Okay, so now you know a little bit more about this show, and I'm sure we'll be receiving

110
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,080
more Daily Source Code frequently asked questions, and of course I'll be posting those

111
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,000
onto a special area of the show site in the show notes so that you can get to those quickly

112
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,520
if you're brand new to the show.

113
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:47,720
Lots of conversations going on about unleashing the pod show pdn, and along with that,

114
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,760
we kind of can't just release the podcaster side.

115
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,840
We kind of have to, the way it's all integrated, release the listener side at the same

116
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,040
time.

117
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,520
Really want to do that next week.

118
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:07,720
The only real gating factor here is the email tax barrier, so we can't actually sign

119
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,160
people up for registrations reliably until all that's in place.

120
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,480
Servers are being, we're putting yesterday, I think, tomorrow configuration starts.

121
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,200
People are going to be working through the weekend because there's just a whole bunch

122
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,760
of things that get put in at one go.

123
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,440
Actually, I think we're also looking for another person to help maintain that.

124
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,360
I'll have to get that from, from a Brian Longus, left to get that, and I'll pass it on

125
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
for you.

126
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,160
There's some very specific SMTP in the email skills that we're looking for on a continuing

127
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
basis.

128
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,000
Zach sends me an email here.

129
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Adam, I was at the Flash Forward Conference in Seattle on the day of your court case.

130
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It was a three day event.

131
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,280
The second day of the conference, the day before your case, Larry Lessig of Creative Commons,

132
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,600
gave a presentation on Creative Commons and the Read Right Internet.

133
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,720
I was hoping you would mention you as a current example of the license holding up in

134
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,800
courts, but it didn't seem like he knew it was going on.

135
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,240
I just finished listening to the Charlie and meant to ask afterwards, but he was swarmed

136
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,760
with others asking questions, so didn't get around to it.

137
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,600
We'll be awesome to get some sort of opinion from Larry himself on the outcome of your

138
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
case.

139
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,960
On the Creative Commons, Canada weblog, actually posted a link to that yesterday, they did have

140
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,840
an interesting rundown of, and I guess that they're now our translated documents because

141
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,280
it looked like they, or they had translated the documents and called it a win for Creative

142
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,280
Commons.

143
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:32,800
But here from Larry, I did send him an email on the day of the court case and he responded

144
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,360
to that, so he said that he was going to look at it and he said, you know, have you posted

145
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,360
about it, and I sent him all the links, still haven't heard from him, and I'm hoping

146
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,680
that I do, you know, I was just doing a Techno-Roddy scan, and you know, lots of people

147
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,800
are now picking up on the news and very happy that Creative Commons holds up, a little

148
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,480
disappointed about the value of the stuff we're creating here online, but so be it.

149
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,480
It's a start.

150
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,320
It's one of the ones, of course, to sing tailwinds because it's a student pile and so

151
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,320
that is it.

152
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,640
That's there's an FAQ for you to go first about the tailwinds.

153
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,720
I did all this preparation last night, and I guess last night, I was chuckling when I

154
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,000
had read the email from Devon Austin Dorf.

155
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,860
Adam, hope you're doing well, not too jet lag.

156
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,320
Today's Charlie waiting for me, having to listen to you, blah, blah, blah.

157
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,120
My wife just gave birth to our daughter on the 24th of February, so I've been a little busy

158
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,480
as you might imagine.

159
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,720
It's expected to do it for your 43rd birthday

160
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,880
from your old pal Caden and his new little Sis Kenzie.

161
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,440
You know what?

162
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,280
Hopefully you can do it for my 42nd

163
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,080
because otherwise we'll have to wait more than a year.

164
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,480
Making me older than I am, man.

165
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,520
I'm 41, 42 in September.

166
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,840
Okay, chord case, but okay, I wanted to add

167
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,560
to the list of things I know are getting filtered out

168
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,920
by the big email providers.

169
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,800
Gmail invites, do not make it to Yahoo email accounts.

170
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,200
I know this firsthand because it took me

171
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,160
asking three different friends to send me an invite

172
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,920
before I finally got one to work.

173
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,400
And that was only on my work email.

174
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,840
And now here's the need of his email.

175
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,640
As you know, I'm a huge fan of the Roger Smalls

176
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,680
jingle and now I've become a fan of this comments as well.

177
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,360
The whole Roger versus comic strip blogger thing

178
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,400
makes me nearly tear up every single time I hear it.

179
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,440
Have you determined where Roger does his recording?

180
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,440
It sounds like an aluminum or aluminium recycling center.

181
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,840
As for CSB's rambling, barely coherent rants,

182
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,520
I think Dawn said it best a few shows back on the Dawn

183
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,520
and Drew show.

184
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
He sounds like Count Chocula,

185
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,320
or as you mentioned people have been saying,

186
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,400
man, yeah, even Patricia thought that, but it's not.

187
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,280
And you'll listen to the MS Mobile's podcast.

188
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,840
This is exactly how he talks.

189
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,320
Seriously though, these two guys at a whole new dimension

190
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,760
of comedy to the Chuckle's Charlie Chip, Charlie, yeah.

191
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,760
Okay, I think right now, Roger has the edge

192
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,240
and the competition for the DSC comedy crown,

193
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,560
though particularly with his Uncle Jesse reference,

194
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,220
I would likely change my tune, however,

195
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,000
CSB mixes a Cooter reference.

196
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,680
Mixes into Cooter reference,

197
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,960
and I think just to Rihla Pink lug but Bitmore you

198
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,740
really should commission the Jeff Smith

199
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,540
to produce a theme song for the satellite repairman himself.

200
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,200
Oh boy, there's a lot of loaded stuff in there

201
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,380
is called comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comics strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic

202
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:22,380
Okay, time to reset your brain. Remember you have to kind of focus in on the accent. But once you get to it, man, there's gold in them words.

203
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:34,460
I had them carry. Because the point you have now in USA, fucking around you are. Well, USA is more

204
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:42,560
fun than Europe for sure. But I don't know whether you have noticed that Howard Stern is being

205
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:52,000
sold by less moon vests. The boss of CBS may be potential folks could help poor Howard Stern

206
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,640
because correct me if I am wrong. Many revenues of potential are coming from serious. And if

207
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:04,320
Howard Stern will be fucked up by the lawsuit, then serious gonna be fucked up too. Please,

208
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,320
Howard, you're...

209
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,320
Ah, it's the new sign off. Yo, thank you very much, Robert.

210
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,320
Clothing strip.

211
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,320
Comic strip.

212
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,320
Comic strip.

213
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
Comic strip.

214
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,320
Alright, is everybody ready?

215
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:47,720
Yeah, another spot where we could use an FAQ. This is the place where us guys hang out and talk

216
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,000
about things that we normally would talk about in public. And sometimes the women folk, the

217
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,640
shaylas check in as well. Here's an old friend of the show, Matt's not grass says, I don't

218
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:03,400
know, I was wondering if you could put the call out for no's hair advice. I'm a torn between

219
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,200
plucking and trimming. Trimming seems to be okay for short term, plucking last longer, but

220
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,480
hurts like a son of a bitch. Any thoughts? Yes, screw those closet cases who are distancing

221
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,520
the metro sexual moment. They sound like they're not secure in their own man who would

222
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,320
keep it up, man. Yeah, absolutely. Well, now this is a question that has not a reason yet,

223
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:27,400
but I have to agree that it's, you know, plucking versus trimming. Now I'm a guy that I like

224
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,960
to trim. I have one of those circuit, well, I have a couple of devices actually. I want

225
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,200
of those circular things that you're like sticking your nose and you turn it and it kind of rips

226
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,680
the hairs out, not a great feeling, but hey, that's where my dad used for, you know, all my life

227
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,560
growing up. So I guess that's why I'm kind of stuck looking at that. Then I've heard that plucking

228
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:51,320
those hairs actually can cause tremendous infection and it's not a good idea. And so what I've

229
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,760
been using recently is a little nose hair trim. It runs on one triple A battery. You know,

230
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:02,760
you just, you know, it has a little, a little, what do you call it? Like you find on the back of

231
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,640
electric razor, you know, and just the saw teeth that are moving back and forth really fast. What's

232
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,320
that called? And you just kind of stick it in there and twirl it around and it cuts everything off.

233
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,960
And that, that has really been something that works for me. But if you have other thoughts about

234
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,000
nose hair, please let me know. And particularly, I want to know if pulling them out or

235
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,520
squeezing or yanking if that is potentially dangerous. Yeah, and this is rust from the raising

236
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:33,320
giant spot cast and I want to give you some feedback for the Metro moment. So I've been inspired by

237
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:40,600
all the talk on the Charlie about the gelette fusion razor, the M3 power. And so I have

238
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:47,880
ditched my electric razor. I've been using since I was 16 years old and purchased the M3 power

239
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:54,120
and more recently the the fusion. I can tell you that I will never go back to the electric.

240
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:02,280
The regular razor, these my skin, much smoother and also, along with the razor, I purchased the

241
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:09,240
gelette complete skin care products and has made a huge difference in my skin. So just the

242
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:16,040
information and come by and check out my podcast at racingjiance.com. That's raising,

243
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,160
thanks Adam. All right, dude. No, thank you very much. It's interesting while you were talking.

244
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,080
Of course, I've heard you wrap before. I ran off to the bathroom here at the condo

245
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,000
because Patricia picked something up for me the other day, which I think it might be what you're

246
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,560
using. It's the Gillette fusion hydro cool after shave gel or as they say in French.

247
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:41,320
Gel après rassage. Cools the skin. Allow rich with hydrating

248
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,280
emolions. My goodness. I can just feel the emolions work and you know what I mean. I got plenty of

249
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:52,040
emolions. And I must say this is, you know, you always have to use some kind of after shave

250
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,200
balm before you actually get down to the moisturiser. So you should be using two products

251
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:03,320
apra rassage. What is it? Rassage. And this stuff is pretty cool. It's kind of like a gel.

252
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,600
It has an easy dispensary, you know, you just kind of squeeze it out and rub it on the skin and

253
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,960
it say it really has a nice cool minty feel to it. And it doesn't dry up all crackly and stuff.

254
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,040
So there's a bit of moisturizer in there. And I have to say, so far I'm liking that.

255
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:24,920
Before this I was using the Nivia after shave stuff. Oh my goodness.

256
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,160
Excuse me, terrible. Hey Adam, wanted to share two new products. I'm using. I heard someone

257
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,880
mention a sugar scrub on your show the other day. Bath and body works has some great products.

258
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,640
The sugar scrubs may be a bit rough on the face but they're really good facial scrubs that get

259
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,440
the same results. Here are the names and links to the products I'm using from Bath and Body Works.

260
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,800
For the body, a Roman therapy sugar scrub that relaxs Eucalyptus Spearment version.

261
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:54,200
And for the face, C.O. Piccolo, honey almond scrub. Where does that work again?

262
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,000
A molyent formula. Please, someone help me? Maybe the podictionary can take check in. Let me know

263
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,640
what emolient means. And oh, please tell me that there's a different pronunciation for

264
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,640
the U.S. than there is in the UK. Yeah, this is Eric Skip from the Bletchcast Colin in with a moment

265
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:16,920
for the Metro Sexual Moment. Metro Mo. Moment. Mo. Yeah, let's just call it the Mama. The Mama.

266
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:22,680
I'm going to Mo for the moment. So, like many guys, I am, let's say, blessed with an overbundance of

267
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,720
hair. Everywhere, but the top of my head. Certainly, if you've ever watched Greye for the straight guy

268
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,720
you'll learn about landscaping. And the process of kind of trimming that hair and bringing it

269
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,400
down to something manageable. Managed hair. Let's get started. I'm sick of shaving. I don't want

270
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,360
to get to your, have stubble places where I shouldn't have stubble. And if I just trim it,

271
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,840
then it comes back so fast and it doesn't really look that much better. So, I decided it was time

272
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,640
to go out on a lemon try. Nare for men. This isn't something I would normally purchase, but I was

273
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,200
desperate. I wanted something that was easy, that was quick, that didn't take all the time that

274
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:00,200
shaving took. So, I give them the shower with my new Nare for men with nice cucumber sand and

275
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,080
avoided it and smelled cucumber and good. And I applied it literally to the hair on my chest,

276
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,080
figuring that it would help take it down. And I went on my shoulders and as much as my back as I could.

277
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,280
And then started to wonder how the heck I was going to reach those parts of my back. I couldn't reach

278
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,320
anyway. So, I waited the requisite a few minutes and, something like the stuff wasn't smelling

279
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,600
so good. No longer cucumber-scented. It smelled a little bit more like wet cat. I had plenty of

280
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,520
time word away, so I stood there waiting waiting. And you know what, now the stuff smelled more like a

281
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:31,960
chemical burn. I started to feel itchy. I didn't really know if I was comfortable with that.

282
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:38,520
And slowly the itch turns to a slight burning sensation and it was certainly smelling

283
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,960
something fierce now. It was time to get this stuff off of me and I stepped on this shower and

284
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,160
started to rinse and scrub. Now, if you've ever witnessed this stuff in action,

285
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:53,000
it doesn't just go where you put it. Not only everywhere that it touched, but everywhere that

286
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:59,720
I hear that it had touched. Came this little nuclear blast of grossed rotting hair. It started on

287
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,120
my chest and then those hairs became all gummy nasty and stuck to my arm hairs which then

288
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,720
rotted off. Which, well, gotten the place that I'm not going to talk about on your podcast.

289
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,120
When all was said and done, I was left with a tiny naked patch on my chest and then kind of a

290
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,400
a weird leprosy-like, fearless bundle of patches everywhere else. Thank you, near for men.

291
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,240
Well, that's my story. I know it's a little long, but hopefully it'll help someone out or

292
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,000
someone can inform me on how you're supposed to actually use that stuff. As always, we're finding

293
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,600
great independent artists and getting them to go pot safe. So if you want to hear what's coming to the

294
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,560
PMN, check out the Glitchcast in iTunes or at GlitchNIC.com slash Glitchcast.

295
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:39,160
Well, you know what, I think that I've mentioned before that I am definitely a user of the

296
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,480
nair products and it just doesn't just have to be nair, but they all pretty much work the same way.

297
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,280
They burn your shit off, and I like to use it on the nether regions because that's just the way I

298
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:55,640
like it. But in general, the only way to do this is you apply it, wait no longer than eight minutes,

299
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,360
but probably no less, really no longer than eight minutes, and then hop in the shower and then you're

300
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,120
just going to wash it all the way. You've got to use a face cloth, get into every single place that

301
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,760
you wanted the hairs to disappear from, and then you'll be safe. Oh, and don't forget, after you do

302
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,920
the application to wash your hands, otherwise you're going to wind up with the bald hands,

303
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,320
another thing that just may not be desirable. Hey, people keep it coming to adamaccurry.com,

304
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,600
so that soon, next week we can check in once again and talk about our Metro stuff.

305
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,080
Speaking of Metro Sexuals, Mark Yoshimura Namcoff is coming up next on Sirius starts one or two

306
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:38,200
with Pacific Coast Hellway. And let us continue here on the Charlie, we have some new additions to

307
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:44,120
the Pod Show family. This is one of my girlfriends. Yes, just listen to this voice, man.

308
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:51,160
Drive your notes. The newest member of the Podcast delivery network is none other than me,

309
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,160
and GB, hostess of the brand new chill cast.

310
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:04,440
Sit back, relax, let me sue you and groove you with the silky smooth mix of independent music

311
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:10,520
that's just right for chillin. From downtown voter deep house, tripop to Dreampop,

312
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,640
electro lounge to old school jazz, you're sure to hear something that really sets a mood for

313
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:21,960
relaxation. So grab a bottle of wine and listen with a friend. Come check it out.

314
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:28,520
It's chillcastupodshow.com. And GB, you ladies and gentlemen, from the love spirals,

315
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,440
friend of the daily source code, now a Pod Show Podcast network member, the chill cast.

316
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,680
I cranked up episode four last night here in the condo. It was just great.

317
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,040
I can really get into the chill vibe, particularly when you have Angie B with their

318
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:50,840
solitary dulcet tones rambling through my MM50 speakers. Angie, good to have you aboard.

319
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,360
And more friends joining the network content. This is really going on.

320
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:02,440
Oh, Adam and daily source code listeners. This is Trucker Tom, proud to announce. I'm joining the

321
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:08,760
Pod Show family of Podcasts. When I was compelled to start podcasting back in December of 2004,

322
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:14,360
I had no idea where it would lead. I only knew it was something I had to do. From the

323
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:20,120
best in Podsafe music, interviews, soundsign tours, the discussion of human behavior,

324
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:26,600
along with occasional video podcasts. I try to keep every daily episode fun and upbeat.

325
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,960
With something of substance for every listener to look forward to, all mixed in with heavy doses

326
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:38,680
of Trucker Tom, philosophy. It's safe to say I deliver content that isn't available anywhere else

327
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:46,360
in the world of Podcasts. Check me out at truckerphoto.com and now also podshow.com.

328
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:57,240
Trucker Tom, I've never actually seen his rig. Trucker Tom, here's a guy. Here's a guy

329
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,960
who needs to be sending in some more stuff for the Metrosexual moment. A guy who was on the road

330
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:11,000
continuously is very involved with his skin and I can say that quite safely because he has tattoos

331
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,200
on many, many, many parts of his body, including basically like a shaved heads on the back of his head.

332
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:25,560
It's basically has another face tattoo a skull on top of his skull and he's just a sweetheart. He's a

333
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:31,880
great guy. I missed him last time. He was at the podshow HQ, so hopefully we'll hook up soon again

334
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,040
really soon. But Trucker Tom, if you're out there listening, you're the guy that's on the road.

335
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,920
As a part of the backbone of the United States, which really is true. I mean, geez, we could not

336
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:50,280
do without Truckers. The economy would die within an instant. Trucker Tom out there on the road.

337
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,440
How do you take care of yourself, man? What's the life like? Well, of course, if you really want

338
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,000
to know what the life is like, then you just need to listen to Trucker Tom's podcast, but maybe

339
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,200
you could send something for the Metrosexual moment. It's going to be a short show today. As I said,

340
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,680
getting ready to pop off to the Board of Directors meeting, Wayne checks in, Wayne Thoom Adam. I don't

341
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,680
know if you remember, but a while back someone asked you to help explain to people that podcasting

342
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,320
is something that doesn't require an iPod or special equipment to enjoy. You explain this and told us

343
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:24,360
that we could extract out your explanation and burn it to a CD with a podcast to help introduce

344
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:30,280
people to podcasting. Yeah, I should actually, we'll make that another part of the audio,

345
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,960
frequently asked questions. I'll pull that bit out again, because someone, I forgot who did it,

346
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,200
but it wrote a nice piece. I read it on the source code and it turns out that lots of people,

347
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,720
including Wayne, have actually done that. They've cut that piece out, edited into in front of

348
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,720
one of their favorite podcasts and have a URL handy where to send someone to go learn more about

349
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:56,280
podcasting. Wayne says, I'm a programmer and was with the CEO of my company trying to explain

350
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:02,120
to another CEO, what podcasting was, I got blank looks all round until I pulled out a CD with your

351
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:07,640
explanation and played it. The first crump comment I heard as they were listening to you was,

352
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:16,040
hey, he's got a good voice. I can just imagine it, your boss is sitting there and like,

353
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:22,440
oh, he's got a good voice. After hearing you and some more explaining for me, I ended up

354
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:29,880
making a good impression. Thank you so much for saving my job. The following audio comment is

355
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:35,400
without a doubt, not family safe. It is not something that you may want to listen to. If you're

356
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:43,160
easily offended, though you really shouldn't be. Mads Weinstein ranted at me last week and

357
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:49,800
yes, it's some really nasty things and just was not showing much love. Luckily, we've got more

358
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:58,920
people listening to this show. Then they do love me. Hi Adam, this is Rebecca from Tranny Recradial,

359
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:05,960
responding to Madge calling you a Tranny Fucker. First of all, I want to say that if you were a

360
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:12,360
Tranny Fucker, I would be the first in line. Second of all, if Madge was calling Tranny,

361
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:18,200
I would like to believe, and matter of fact I know, the transgender community would be honored to have

362
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:25,240
her in our ranks. Third of all, I have to inform you and your listeners that Madge has already agreed

363
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:31,640
to some hot Lesbow action after I get my surgery. So that would make her a Tranny Fucker.

364
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,720
For the rest of you that want to join those ranks, visit my website, Trannyrec.com.

365
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,400
I'll bet if you thank you so much, I feel so much better now and I'm sure for sure she would take

366
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:54,440
that as a huge compliment. I have been be down, my heart left for broken, but I still feel the light

367
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:05,080
and the sunshine is due. I have swallowed my pride, but my heart has salvation,

368
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:16,120
there will always be shelter when the storm rolls in, and there's light,

369
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:34,120
there will be hope to rise on my feet again, and with this hope I'll find the strength

370
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:40,840
to rise on my feet again.

371
00:31:49,080 --> 00:32:01,160
The highway that here begins in the valley of a thousand trees that I never realized.

372
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:12,360
Strength is my soul, silence is mercy for the stream of control,

373
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:29,880
hallelujah I cry, and where there's a light that will be home to rise on my feet again.

374
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:47,080
And with this hope I'll find the strength to rise on my feet again.

375
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:17,160
It's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright,

376
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:25,800
it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright,

377
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:54,040
there will be hope to rise on my feet again, and with this hope I'll find the strength to rise on my feet again.

378
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:04,840
From Colorado, Graham English, on my feet again winding up Charlie for Thursday.

379
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,440
Tomorrow, thank God, it's Friday, addition tomorrow is going to be a really busy day,

380
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:15,560
going to do a Gilmore Daily with Steve Gilmore, oh I'm sorry, now that's next week, oops, that was wrong.

381
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:22,520
What we're doing to tomorrow is Cali, that's right, Cali Lewis from Geek Brief TV is up in San Francisco,

382
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:31,240
and we're going to do something together. Cali was voted one of the top 10 sexiest geek chicks I saw.

383
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,840
So what do I see that yesterday? It was going around the office, she is so incredibly cute,

384
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:41,640
and then I was listening to her on podcast four on one, as I was drifting off to sleep, which of course

385
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:46,520
what better way to do that and with Cali's voice in your ear. Very interesting, interesting history

386
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:53,640
about what how she got into podcasting her first site was, I believe, crappy Christians,

387
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,480
or the first podcast with crappy Christians, which I have to go back and listen to now.

388
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,440
But they start off listening to Don and Drew, when I say they, it's Cali and her husband,

389
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,320
which of course is the only bummer thing about Cali, is that she's married.

390
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,240
So I guess I'm going to be on the show, I don't know what we're going to do, but I have some

391
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:18,920
questions for her. All right, everybody. So I'm off quick, triple S, we know what the triple S is,

392
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,880
don't we guys? And then I'm off to the office, and tomorrow I will report back, see if our board of

393
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:30,840
directors walked into the conference room, going ribbit ribbit. And I thank you all very much for
