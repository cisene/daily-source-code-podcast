Delta Sierra Charlie 416.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You're less than an hour.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Aircraft from here will join others for around the world.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And you will be launching the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
mankind.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Words should have new meaning for all of us today.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We will be united in our common interests.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Perhaps space today is before the July.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And you will once again be fighting for our freedom.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Not from tyranny and oppression or persecution.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And from annihilation.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We're fighting for our right to live.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
To exist.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It should be with the day.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The Fourth of July will no longer be known as American holiday.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
As the day with the world declared in one voice,

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
we will not go quietly into the night.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We will not vanish without a fight.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And we're going to live on.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We're going to survive.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And there we shall be.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Long history today.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let's the Fourth of July again.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Battle rockets light the sky.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And I was looking for a telephone.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Just to call and ask you out.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And kids are running down for stamina.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
With their spark dwells in their hands.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Release the barricaded St. Mark's place.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Tonight they're yours and far in land.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I toss in turn on sleepless nights.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
To try and find the words to the same.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
How can I be so dependent?

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Please don't leave on independent stay.

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So I went to the pole, the shruster run.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Down on second they're the blue.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I sat down and had myself the sandwich there.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I had a cup of chicken soup.

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Walking home I saw the fireworks.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's the first thread wide and blue.

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't know how I'm going to live my life.

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Three thousand miles away from you.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I toss in turn on sleepless nights.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
To try and find the words to the same.

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
How can I be so dependent?

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Please don't leave on independent stay.

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's the fuck up July again.

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's a daily source code for July 4th 2006.

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Apologies right up front for the noise in the background.

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
There's a heat wave in Europe and most homes in certainly in the United Kingdom are not air conditioned.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And the cottage, well, would you expect a cottage to be air conditioned?

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Of course I do have the warmest room in the house.

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So I've got two units here going full blasts, the blinds are down.

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And we kicked off the show with the Goodman Brothers Independence Day.

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Of course the link to that in the show notes.

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So here we are.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Doing a show, doing a podcast.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And you are probably wondering how I'm doing, how everything's going.

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And what the hell I'm doing podcasting at all perhaps.

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That's a fair question.

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So for those of you listening for the first time,

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
my mom passed away this past Sunday.

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And I refer to the previous show on daily source code.com.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
If you want more information about that.

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I wasn't quite sure what to do with the show.

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
My mom and knew very well what Ron and I were always up to.

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
She loved Ron very much.

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That often.

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And she felt that he was good for me.

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You know what I mean?

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So she always had a good vibe, which was always very interested in what we were doing.

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What we were up to, she knew about what was going on in the UK.

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And she also knew that the next couple of weeks were going to be pretty big and pretty important for us and for pod show.

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And for me personally, of course, and she was very interested in what we were doing and how we were going about it.

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And of course, everything all comes at the same time.

83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And I had a decision to make.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Now, first of all, I totally acknowledge that I am absolutely still grieving,

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
even though just about everything.

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I think everything actually has been taken care of.

87
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And you know, I'll talk about that in a bit.

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And I definitely need some emotional time.

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
We'll need that in the not too distant future.

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Just to chill out a little bit and sort some things out.

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's very interesting.

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I've never had anyone close to me die ever.

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Not this close, obviously.

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And it kind of comes in waves.

95
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You know, it's.

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm paying attention to it.

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm really, you know, and all the appropriate messages are going off of my head.

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I definitely appreciate anyone who thinks that I probably shouldn't be podcasting at all.

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But it really does feel good.

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's so yeah, just enlightening.

101
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It feels good.

102
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's cathartic.

103
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You know, I can get stuff out there.

104
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And you guys are my buddies.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Damn, are you?

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The outpouring of love and.

107
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Messages of stories and personal stories.

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And oh, man, this has been so great.

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
My sisters, I don't think they ever really listen to the podcast.

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
My sister and Italy does.

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But bandwidth is so messed up there.

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
She can't listen to it very regularly.

113
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It all only had work.

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And of course, she.

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
She's the kind of person that wants to be working at work and not listening to podcasts.

116
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But they they also heard the show.

117
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Because of course, I consulted with them.

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And, you know, just hundreds of comments from all over the world.

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And there were phone calls to to pod show HQ, people wanting some flowers.

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And it was just unreal.

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I really didn't know how close we are.

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And, you know, a lot of people sent me messages.

123
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And lots of voicemails as well.

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Thank you.

125
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Of course, you know, a lot of them I felt were just personal.

126
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And I'm not going to share those at all.

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But really, really, really appreciated it.

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's, you know, a lot of people would say, well, this podcasting really has created something special.

129
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Of course, it's not really podcasting.

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's, it's much more basic than that.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's the fact that we have this communication.

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And that we're pretty open and honest with each other.

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And we're not forced by constraints like time and another issues to sound to be fake.

134
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I guess that's it.

135
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That's what makes it so beautiful.

136
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And the internet is full of that.

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's not just podcasting.

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But wow, when you add that dimension of voice, it really does make a difference.

139
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I feel.

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So I wrote a couple things down here.

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah.

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So again, thank you everybody who commented or sent person.

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's so, it's so amazing.

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I look at my inbox.

145
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And I have it set to 100 messages per page.

146
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And every single one is, is about my mom.

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Just beautiful stories and nice little quick notes.

148
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It doesn't matter if it was long or short.

149
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's just fantastic receive all that.

150
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And not a single bit of spam.

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
There's not one penis in larger in the 100 on the top page.

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's so magical.

153
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But we did touch each other with this.

154
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And so, you know, I talked to this long around,

155
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and around there to get back to the fact that I talked to a number of people,

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
talked about, you know, considering what's going on in my life right now.

157
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And I really do want a podcast.

158
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And just, you know, I took some advice from some, some wiser people,

159
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
my wife, my business partner.

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And we all agree that mom probably would have kicked my ass if I had not continued through this next period.

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And just, you know, had some fun and gotten on with it and do the task at hand.

162
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And that I know, hands down.

163
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
There's no, there's just no doubt on my mind whatsoever or anyone else's.

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So I'm definitely going to do that.

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I just wanted to share one audio comment that I got just to give you an idea of how deep this went.

166
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
This was so deep.

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's just beautiful. Listen to this.

168
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Hey Adam, I just wanted to wish you my condolences on the singing mom.

169
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
This is Michelle from Seattle.

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
My cult once or twice before, but I lost my mother to learn cancer when I was 12.

171
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I kind of know what you're going through.

172
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I was pretty young, but, you know, at least, you know, I think it's cool that you had a satisfying relationship with her.

173
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
As an adult, I got that with my dad before he passed away, but I didn't get that with my mom.

174
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So, you're a lot deen that regard.

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And I wanted to say, you know, you can, I mean, I'm sure you're a pretty enlightened guy.

176
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So I'm sure you know that she's either, she's either her energy,

177
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
her beautiful energy is out enriching the world and making it a better place now, or, you know,

178
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
depending on what you believe, or she's just free of all pain and all that.

179
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
All the stuff she had to go through there, and so, you know, where you should start, you know,

180
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
she's probably still herself and just without all the, all the yucky stuff that she had to deal with in the physical world.

181
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Either way, she's, I'm sure better off than she was there at the end.

182
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So, let me, man, I'm thinking of you. Okay?

183
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Bye.

184
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Thank you, Michelle. See, this is what I mean.

185
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This is not about my mom. This is not about me or my family.

186
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's about all of us as human beings.

187
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And we all have hardships like this, and, you know,

188
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
life on the planet can be extremely short.

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That's for sure. So, ride the wheels off this motherfucker, will you?

190
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And go hug someone you love.

191
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And so, even though my mom is not in the physical world,

192
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
one thing I know for sure, you're stuck with her, because she lives inside of me,

193
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
as she lives inside of my sisters, and really many other people,

194
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
because amongst all of these, all these emails and comments and voice mail feedback,

195
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
a lot of people talked about my mom about the things she would say.

196
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
She always had, well, what she called sampler saying,

197
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't know if you remember, I don't know if you know it all.

198
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's a very American thing.

199
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
What was it, is it crochet work or is it a needle point, I think.

200
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You create a needle point for on the wall, and it has some kind of slogan on it.

201
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Like one that sticks out that hangs on my mom's wall is the road to a friend's house

202
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
and never long, and this is a tradition really from her side of the family.

203
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But she had a couple other sayings and rules that she lived by

204
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
that I'll share with you today.

205
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And again, you know, I'm not going to try and push this away,

206
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
stuff will pop up over the course of the next, whatever, you know,

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and shows, and I hope you don't mind, I hope you enjoy it.

208
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It'll just pop up.

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Maybe I get Jeff, say and say, oh, maybe I get Jeff Smith to do a jingle for my mom moment.

210
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So my mom had a big thing with butterflies, and she had this from her mom.

211
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
In fact, they were very similar, beautiful blonde.

212
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Kind of Marilyn Monroe asked classy, big bed of Davis eyes,

213
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
and my grandmother's nickname was Whiffy, because she always whiffed the golf ball.

214
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And my mom's nickname was Breezy, but they also had this butterfly thing.

215
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And so my mom always wore a butterfly on her left shoulder,

216
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
and she had an enormous collection.

217
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And by the way, it should be cremated everybody who attends that very small ceremony

218
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:16,000
will take a butterfly from her box and wear it and take it home with them.

219
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And man, she had everything all set out.

220
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So anyway, I want to give you two of her life slogans, which I really like.

221
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So one of them is, if nothing changed, there would be no butterflies.

222
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And the one I heard her say a lot in the last couple of months was,

223
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I used to complain about not having any shoes until I met a man with no feet.

224
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And so my mom was full of stuff like that, and she loved to write stuff down.

225
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
She had this folder that we weren't supposed to open until it was time.

226
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And so we did after she passed away, and it was really funny.

227
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
She had written all kinds of great personal notes to us, and she even had a...

228
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
We have kind of a morbid humor, I guess, in the family.

229
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But she wrote this whole thing about, hey, you know, dude, if I'm incapacitated, pull the plug.

230
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's so good we all wanted a copy of it.

231
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It was very, very funny, last will and testament.

232
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And there was some other personal and private stuff in there.

233
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But then she'd also written her obituary, which was placed in the newspaper today.

234
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
She wrote the invite. She was very specific, had taken care of all of her arrangements.

235
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And then there was this separate invite because she wanted, and my sister has it.

236
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
She'll get me a PDF file. I should read it to your verbatim. It's hilarious.

237
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
My mom, of course, really was a little bit too old to be a hippie, but too young to be a hippie.

238
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Wait a minute, I guess she was too old to be a hippie.

239
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And she was kind of in that in between the 50s and 60s.

240
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So she definitely grew up with the Bobby Sox, and she is from the rock and roll era.

241
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Which, of course, is why I know the lyrics, almost every single 50s hit you can even think of.

242
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I can verbatim sing all that well. I know the lyrics. I'm not a fantastic singer as we all know.

243
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So she said, my children here by invite you to honor my last wish, which is a 50s rock and roll party.

244
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So we're reading this like, oh man, it's so typical of my mom.

245
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I spent a lot of the past day and a half or two days organizing this.

246
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Well, I'm not going to tell you too much because we still want it to be pretty private, but man, I'll take pictures.

247
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And I got it completely figured out, worked out, arranged. It's going to be awesome.

248
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And everyone's very excited and intrigued by this whole thought. And I think it's great.

249
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You know, if that's the way she wants everyone to say goodbye to her, it has kind of an Irish vibe to it.

250
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Only typical of the way my mom would do it in her 50s fashion.

251
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So I had a lot of fun putting that together, actually, and it was not easy getting it all together at the last moment, but

252
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
the only mom we're going to have a ball. Now, okay, onward because we got a lot of stuff to do today.

253
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
A lot of cool stuff to talk about.

254
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The number one thing is now, of course, you know, pod show is my family as well.

255
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And everybody knows each other. We're still thank God. And hopefully we can stay this way for a long time.

256
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We're small enough in work force that we do know each other.

257
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And we do feel like a family.

258
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Everyone has really been grieving along with us, also for their own personal reasons.

259
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But I just heard that we're going to have yet another baby introduced into the pod show family.

260
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm not going to tell you who yet because this was internal. I don't know if there's, you know, let's just, I think they're on the way to the hospital now, and I think we've got a fourth of July baby.

261
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So, you know, it's the whole thing just really is, it's kind of in sync there. It's starting to balance each other out.

262
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And I'm so happy that finally I'm old enough to be in a company that can legitimately make little baby podcaster t-shirts. I just love the whole

263
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
thing.

264
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Wait a minute. She didn't want to play that. He's what I wanted to play.

265
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Adam, this is beautiful room from the Netherlands. It just occurs to me which dates you shoot day for pod show, pod show, pod show, pod show, pod show.

266
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Not only one day that's excellent since you're independent from the record labels, that sort of thing.

267
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So it should be an independent day, the 4th of July.

268
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I wonder if that's true. Well, I think it is. I don't know of course.

269
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Dude.

270
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Bye bye.

271
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Okay, I know you're touched, but you can't be Dutch and that blonde. Yes, of course.

272
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That's what it's been about all these weeks.

273
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
We've been leading up to the freedom of your, your media independence day, pod casting.

274
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
We're launching or are really unleashing pod show plus the pod cast delivery network.

275
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
This was a date that was I think brilliantly chosen by by the by the team.

276
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Ron and I just took this as a recommendation and love the idea.

277
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
For a number of reasons one, not a lot of you are going to be paying attention to me today.

278
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So we can kind of ease into it and we can, you know, we can mess a lot of stuff up without disappointing too many people.

279
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Additionally, it's a, it really is very symbolic. I love that.

280
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And so here's 50 people who have given up their major portion of not all of their 4th of July to do this.

281
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You know, I, I can't say how blown away I am by it and how excited I am to have all of this happening today over the next couple of days.

282
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's going to continue. Well, we're, it's an unleash. It's a, it's a public beta, which means,

283
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:14,000
well, we're doing our darners and we'll be communicating as much as we can and you'll be feeding it back and yeah, we're going to have some fun.

284
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I hope I really hope you like it. This is like the unveiling of, you know, this piece of art that we've been working on secretly in the lab for such a long time.

285
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And now I've seen so many different versions of it and, you know, things on so many different test servers.

286
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And I'm, I'm even confused about what I'm seeing anyway. It's, you're going to love it. You really will. It is a totally different way of enjoying media.

287
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Whether it's audio, whether it's video and we certainly plan to expand. You're going to see the podcast, music network being integrated in some really cool ways.

288
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And we got, we got a lot of work to this is just ground zero for us. This is just what we're starting.

289
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So keep checking podshow.com sometime today. It's going to be up.

290
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
In fact, let me take a look right now.

291
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And what's the time? It is 608 PM in, almost a second in Guilford. So let me go to podshow.com.

292
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Let's see if it's up. Nope, still the old homepage. Okay.

293
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
All right. So that means it's what is it 10 AM in San Francisco. I think it will be another hour or so.

294
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And then you might see some changes starting to happen.

295
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So be on the lookout for me online. I should just be in there as Adam, daily source code will be in there.

296
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And there is lots of ways to communicate and talk with each other. If you're interested in doing a podcast, you could try that out today.

297
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:05,000
The minute you get in, you can try, you can start podcasting immediately, whether it's for one person or just a tester for your friends or if you're a pro.

298
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Go ahead, give it a whirl. Please. But also check out how I think we've made your life.

299
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Oh, easier with the factor of 10, just on managing all this stuff and how we can interact with each other.

300
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Can't wait to hear what you guys think of it. So also be a look. I'll look out for Winthorbe Valentine and Balthazar.

301
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:35,000
There are perusing through the whole podshow plus empire, spreading their seeds of good love.

302
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And we've got the site guy and all kinds of stuff.

303
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So what do we have now? 22, 22 and a half minutes. Perfect.

304
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I am going to play a song that I heard on CC Chapman's accident has she had a special edition.

305
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Now stuff like that catches my eye and I'm definitely going to listen to it.

306
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It comes from Jesta and I think it's so appropriate for today.

307
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It's of course called Independence Day, but listen to the lyrics because it's about us.

308
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Everybody's talking about the internet works. Ben with responses and advertising in service.

309
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Everybody's talking stuff so until that show, I hear my voice cry on that show section.

310
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Everybody's talking about net neutrality.

311
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Everybody's talking about net neutrality.

312
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Everybody's talking about net neutrality.

313
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Everybody's talking about net neutrality.

314
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Everybody's talking about net neutrality.

315
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Everybody's talking about net neutrality.

316
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Everybody's talking about net neutrality.

317
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Everybody's talking about net neutrality.

318
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
