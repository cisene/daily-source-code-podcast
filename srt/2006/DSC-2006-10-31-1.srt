Y'all around, round wide a green

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,300
Even rushes from all the space

5
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,900
Have a ride to grow and live

6
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,100
So don't you tell me

7
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,100
Everything's right

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,100

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No, there's garbage in this world

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,500
But the news makes sure it to deliver at home

15
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Violence, disrespect, and sex

16
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,500
No, there's it's all the same

17
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,000
You laugh, you cry

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Most of my dislikes out

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If you've got the green, you're safe

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Because this system will cut your break

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So don't you tell me

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You know, when you get an email on Tuesday from the official music colleges of the Charlie

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,440
Jersey Todd, saying you got to check this out.

76
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:46,400
You got to check it out and spot on, J.T. Of course, he's from Jersey, Dan Annable.

77
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,240
That was, uh, affliction, influences according to his page and the pod safe music network,

78
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,640
Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Glenn Gold, Billy Joel, the Beatles.

79
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,040
Yeah, what do you expect? Dude, love that song. Fantastic. Everybody how you doing

80
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,440
depending on where you is, uh, where you is at. It's either Tuesday or Wednesday.

81
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,760
Perhaps it's even Thursday if you're not down on it. This is the daily source code

82
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,160
episode 488 coming to you from the Curry Cottage in the affluent suburb of Surrey

83
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:19,720
known as Guilford. Um, it's been crazy. It's just been crazy, but I, I really wanted to get

84
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:26,360
to show out today, uh, particularly because, um, tomorrow's show will be late as well. So I wanted

85
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,280
to make sure that you had something, something to, to listen to. And then we try and keep the

86
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:37,800
daily in daily source code. Um, so, um, today, women. So yesterday, after the show, I rushed out

87
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,200
the doors. I told you, um, went to the office. We were finishing up a shoot for a show called,

88
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:52,520
Who's on it, which is, um, hosted by OJ, uh, done in the pod show London crash pad, which is

89
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,720
not really what it's officially been dubbed. So that show will be launching, uh, I think, uh, November

90
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,920
9th is when we start launching that show, BT Pod Show.com. Of course you'll be able to, uh,

91
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,880
watch the show and, uh, and get it as usual through, uh, Pod Show.com as well. No worries there.

92
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,720
Um, and then, um, basically Ron and I spent the rest of the evening and night working on

93
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,960
our presentation for this morning, which was a scheduled for 9 a.m. with, uh, uh, the BT folks,

94
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,200
British Telecom, or partners here in the UK. Um, and it was pretty intricate. You know, Ron and I

95
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,800
really like to put on a show. We've been doing this for, I don't know, 12 years. So we have huge 65-inch

96
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:39,160
plasmus. Was it yet? No, was it 65-inch or centimeters? Nothing was 64-inch plasma screens. Uh,

97
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,160
yeah, great sound, uh, system, uh, laptop hooked in, you know, nice plexiglass, electrons. It's

98
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,680
very, very swank. We've got this, uh, crew here, uh, audiovisual crew, um, in London who just

99
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,080
know exactly the way we want it. And it's very cool. It is literally like a performance. It's a

100
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,280
little show as we call it. So the BT folks rolled in, uh, exactly on time, of course, you know,

101
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,160
you, you got it. You can count on those English, man. They are always there on time. Um, so this

102
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,680
was an update, uh, we're getting ready for the launch of BTpodshow.com, uh, it was an update where we

103
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,000
are, uh, and then we really, um, had an entire proposal attached to it. Um, uh, uh, how we were going

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:26,840
to, uh, spend, uh, some of those, uh, BT sterlings, shillings, uh, on, uh, on really, really rolling out

105
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:32,520
pod casting in the UK and, and really taking hold of it in one fell swoop. Remember BT spends a

106
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,200
lot of money on advertising. All telephone companies do a lot of it. So what better than to put that

107
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:44,760
to use for for the, this new movement. And I'm very proud of, uh, of the presentation we gave. And I think

108
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,400
it really caught storm. I think that they, they, they, they did get their own fires. We got meetings tomorrow,

109
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:56,600
another 10 a.m. meeting. So, um, it's, um, I only had like, I think I landed like three or four hour

110
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,520
now I had probably four hours of sleep, Ron probably got three. We were working two separate rooms,

111
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:07,480
which actually by happenstants were next to each other. Um, and I was working on a, um, a demo

112
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:13,800
for the IPTV, which is basically, um, well, they, they call it, you know, television over internet

113
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,760
protocol. And I just look at it as another great distribution vehicle for video and audio podcasts.

114
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:26,200
And more actually, you know, pictures, you know, uh, your, uh, your digs. Imagine that,

115
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:33,320
dig in undiggin, uh, managing your entourage with a remote control. So I was working on that piece of

116
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,560
demo. And, uh, so tired. It was really, really rough. You know, to do that in a hotel room makes

117
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,760
even suck here in the band with us always kind of iffy. Um, it's nice though one of my favorite, uh,

118
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:51,480
video producers, um, Skype to me and we chatted for a couple minutes. Uh, if you've never seen

119
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:59,000
cats cast, uh, you got to check it out, cats cast with kz.podshow.com. Uh, Kacha who actually, um, uh,

120
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,320
did the Adam's family reality show with me is now doing a video podcast. It's fucking awesome.

121
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,160
You got to check it out. I mean, this is, this is what happens when you let a pro loose on stuff.

122
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:13,400
Again, it's really whack. It's great. So that was nice. Um, it kind of, uh, distracted for a little while

123
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:21,080
there. And then, uh, uh, did that with a boss? We were really tired after the meeting.

124
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,960
I had, uh, full English, which I'm totally into that. This full English breakfast. Man,

125
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:31,160
does that shit fill you up? Hopped on the train almost, uh, fell, uh, luckily I woke up at

126
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,560
woken when I was dead tired, fell asleep. You know, I probably would have gone all the way down

127
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:42,840
to ports. I hadn't woken up because of the one stop at woken, uh, came back, you know, hung out.

128
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,480
Oh, Christina has a new, uh, boyfriend, by the way. I told you that Liam was out of the picture.

129
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,800
New kid, cute, nice kid tall, tall, nice teeth, hooves all seem to be in order.

130
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,480
I can't wait to talk about him with Patricia. We have a lot of stuff to discuss. We've actually

131
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,880
started a couple conversations in the past a few days since I've been back and we keep saying,

132
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,520
I don't know, let's just wait. Let's keep that for the show. Don't talk about it. I don't want,

133
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,320
I don't want too much good stuff to get out. And she's now saying that too, by the way.

134
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,040
And she has a pretty cool, uh, announcement to make. I don't know if she can do it this week or

135
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,280
next week, but I'll definitely get her on. Once I get all the pod show San Francisco,

136
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,400
people back to San Francisco and I get some peace and quiet around here, you know.

137
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,760
Then only then can we get to the really cool stuff?

138
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:35,560
Uncrawling casting with Adam. Oh yeah. Adam, who are you ready to be stumps? Bring it on.

139
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,920
That's he is. Then he will cast a cast with young format.

140
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:44,360
Ah, the rematch. Hey Adam, this is hit test number 70 on the daily source code.

141
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:51,960
And according to all the emails and other responses on last week's hit test one time return

142
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,680
off the hit test in the daily source code. It's still very popular, so hopefully this can occur

143
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:02,840
more often. And of course, that all depends on the possible licensing agreement. So

144
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,280
I'll tell you more about that. In meantime, there is a hit test. Three intros. Let's do answers.

145
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,880
And this is intro number one.

146
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:20,280
Of course, it's the second time I've heard it. This is uh, Donna summer. I've got my thing. I love

147
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,640
is in control. Donna summer. Number two.

148
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,280
That's uh, Crab or Crab.

149
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,680
Jimmy Summerville. And today's final intros number three.

150
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,200
Oh, I know that one. Oh, one of my favorites. That will be remember the promise you made by

151
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:50,840
Crab and John. This is fun again, buddy. And times up and these are the answers.

152
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,360
I'm sure number one. Here we go.

153
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:59,160
Yeah, song from 1982 by disco diva Donna summer. This is love is in control.

154
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,600
Oh, this is time like with some cowbell.

155
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,280
Inside my life.

156
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
Just hold on to me.

157
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,080
Hey, Quincy Jones production that sounds much like the Jackson's.

158
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,480
Donna Summer. Sorry, cute. Finger on the trigger. Love is in control. As answer number one.

159
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,720
And this is answering number two from 1984. Small town boy. This is Bronsky Beats.

160
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:58,760
Oh, I got the Jimmy Summerville part right and the lyric right.

161
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:35,160
Yeah, Jimmy Summerville and small town boy is answering number two.

162
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,800
And this is answering number three in today's contest.

163
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:47,000
From 1986, Gark Robin. Yes, Gark Robin. This is the promise you made. I got that one right.

164
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,880
Not nice at it, y'all.

165
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,800
Now with a great song.

166
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,360
Answer number three in the second return of the hit test in the daily source code.

167
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,280
Cac Robin and the promise you made. Two stars for the curry cottage.

168
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:42,600
Okay, well, that's it. All 80s music in this hit test. Hopefully there will be another hit test or more hit tests.

169
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:49,480
But of course, it all depends on whether you have good news and licensing and how that's all going to be

170
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,640
taking care of if possible at all. Well, thank you for playing at him.

171
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,000
Maybe until next time. So until then, take care and bye bye.

172
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:13,080
Well, thank you, Gark Robin. And I'm sure Yon will be posting links to those songs and iTunes.

173
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,560
You know, Yon, I don't think we have to worry about any licensing dude because the way she had those songs.

174
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:24,280
Cac Robin was not the way I remember it. Remember the edits you made.

175
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:31,800
Hey Adam, it's Carmen Tyler. Oh, hey Carmen. I wanted to say hello and to tell you, well, first off,

176
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,080
it's pretty early in the morning for me. It's like nine o'clock and I usually don't like it till 12.

177
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,520
Oh, the life of a fave a beauty queen. I usually don't wake up until 12.

178
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,080
But I woke up this morning and for some reason, I had you on my mind.

179
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:54,360
Okay, see, this is what you get when you, when you don't do a show for a day and all of a sudden

180
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,240
Carmen wakes up thinking of me. What do you think that means, Carmen?

181
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,640
What do you think, former Miss Louie Ziana was doing thinking about me early in the morning?

182
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:11,640
So early in the morning and so strong were these thoughts that she felt compelled to talk to me at nine a.m.

183
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,800
Three hours earlier than her.

184
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:22,760
Three hours during her beauty sleep period. Which is a little crazy. So, um, I wanted to let you know

185
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,240
that you guys all of you pod gasters out. Hold on a second. I was just

186
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:37,240
That's going to make sure I'm in the right mood for your Carmen. I have really inspired me and I am actually podcasting now.

187
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:43,160
I have my own podcast. Yeah, yeah. I've only done three episodes. So, um, I'm a baby. I'm a neophyte.

188
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,120
Oh, what? A neophyte?

189
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,160
Oh, man. Hold on.

190
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,760
Should I can't even spell dictionary.com? How'd that K get in there? Hold on.

191
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,840
Dictionary.com. I use this all the time. I love that. I don't know why I haven't bookmarked it yet. Okay.

192
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,040
Neophyte.

193
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:21,720
Big word for the pod father. Oh, neophyte with a y. Okay. Did you mean neophyte? Yes.

194
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,480
The neophyte. Okay.

195
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,840
Where are we here? A recent convert to a belief

196
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:43,720
a pressolite or a beginner, a novice, a neophyte at politics or three a Roman Catholic church, a newly

197
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:50,200
ordained priest. Hm, she is definitely part of the cult or be a novice of a religious order

198
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:56,120
or congregation. Oh, and check this out. Yeah, we have a little uh, uh, thought that there was a little

199
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:02,280
speaker icon. Oh, what happens here? If I click this, would it work? Oh, premium login.

200
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:09,640
Yeah, I think not. Okay, Carmen. You've joined the dark side. Hey, this is Carmen.

201
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:15,240
Ah, shit. I'm sorry. But I'm having fun doing this and I completely respect you guys because this

202
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:22,840
is like hard work and I don't have like a lot of major equipment. So Carmen, even though you've never

203
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:30,200
sent me the naked pictures, I assure you you have the proper equipment. I can imagine with all

204
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,320
this stuff that you guys put into it and everything and I'm sending my promo, but I'm not sure

205
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:40,680
if you can actually play it because it's um anything. We're going to have political calamity by

206
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:46,200
extreme, which is one of your favorite songs and albums I love that album. Okay, anything. But um,

207
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,480
I'm going to send it to you anyway, but people, if they want to listen to it, they can go to

208
00:18:51,480 --> 00:19:01,640
www.carmincast.net. Of course, it's k-r-m-y-n-k-s-t.net. You can listen to my second show to find out

209
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:09,720
why it's .net and not .com that was irritating. Okay. But um, I'm really having lots of fun and it's

210
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,920
really just a silly show and I talk about crazy things that come to my head. No, I like you show

211
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,360
very much, Carmen, of course I've listened to it and I'm going to play your promo in a second too.

212
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,680
I like it. I love it. I particularly love what you're saying today.

213
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,440
Okay, I said in my promo, no one wants to be inside my head, honestly.

214
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,080
No, no, I'm going to leave that one alone.

215
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:38,360
That I just wanted to pass this information along and just tell you again how much I thank you for

216
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:45,720
your support for me as musician and um, you guys are awesome. Oh, and maybe I guess maybe you could play

217
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,240
the um, we had the hit test the other day. So, or yesterday, or listen to the one yesterday.

218
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,600
So, maybe you can't play this promo. I'm not sure, but you use your discretion and everything,

219
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,960
but I just wanted to let you know about it and then I'm having a really great time and enjoy it.

220
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:07,160
Okay, Carmen. I really appreciate what you said there. And by the way, there's I got a little

221
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:13,320
bone to pick with the podish beer. So, you know, this is something that's been ongoing for several

222
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,400
weeks. If not several months and I didn't say anything about it and people email me at least three

223
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,920
times a day about this and it's really heated up. Um, a couple of months ago on, you know,

224
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:29,080
Ricky Jervais, Ricky Jervais podcast, the only podcast in the Guinness Book of World Records.

225
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,200
The only people desperate enough to actually actually call up the Guinness Book of World Records to

226
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:44,280
prove something. Um, started, um, a promotional campaign on audible, which is they had a deal with

227
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,800
audible, which I guess wasn't too successful because they shut it down. I heard Ricky Jervais

228
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:57,480
on the BBC London talking about a total of 180,000 purchase tracks or podcasts in that case,

229
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,920
which by the way, you know, at a pound of pop, not bad at all. Nothing to sneeze at,

230
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,960
but it wasn't the millions and millions that that he perhaps expected. Maybe it's a little more

231
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,640
worth any expected. That's kind of the way he sounded on BBC London when he was talking about it.

232
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:20,040
They started his promotion and position Ricky Jervais as the pod father. And at

233
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:26,440
insult to injury, they actually used the the the pod father poster graphic, which,

234
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,640
man, we've been using that for, you know, what, uh, over a year, maybe a year and a half now.

235
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:38,600
So, you know, the exact same setup. And I just want to reiterate that, uh, I'm not the self-proclaimed

236
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:45,560
pod father, Andrew Grummit, uh, who developed a co-developed iPod or lemon, uh, gave me that moniker.

237
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:50,280
And, of course, it's stuck and, and I, and I've been wearing it with pride, obviously. I think it's awesome.

238
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,680
I think it's funny. Um, and I figured that there was just a little bit of bad blood, you know,

239
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,960
they're over at audible, um, because you remember when, uh, had all those meeting was Don Kats,

240
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,960
the CEO of audible, and then they were going to come out with this really stupid offering that we

241
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,480
thought was pretty stupid, which in hindsight, I don't think it's gotten a lot of uptake.

242
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,480
Was it word, word cast? I think it's called, um, just those not the direction we wanted to go,

243
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,720
but yeah, it was a little slippery and kind of tried to slide us into that deal and we pulled out

244
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,760
at the very first portable media expo, actually. Uh, so I thought, uh, okay, so that's probably

245
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:30,600
audible, kick-and-shin, you know, whatever, uh, just move on. But now Ricky Gervais is, uh,

246
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,800
is back to him some pod cast. And, um, he's being paid to do three pod cast by the Guardian,

247
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:41,400
the Guardian newspaper in general, a respectable, uh, a newspaper. Um, although lots of people

248
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,320
have very strong opinions about the Guardian, and today on the back page, and of course I've been

249
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,760
seeing, you know, the emails that started heat up again, but now I really sought for the first time.

250
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:55,080
There it is. Three pod cast to be done, uh, released in conjunction with the Guardian, uh,

251
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,640
by the pod father, and they use the same graphic and, you know, the same positioning.

252
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:06,120
And I, I don't mind if Ricky Gervais wants to, uh, take the title, uh, but this cannot be a

253
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:12,360
serious publication that, that basically plagiarizes. This is 100% plagiarism, and everybody knows it.

254
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,800
Everybody who's been in pod casting for more than a day knows that is plagiarism.

255
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,400
And, uh, no one's calling him on it. The other, you're emailing me, but gosh, you know,

256
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,200
it would be nice for someone to say, fuck you guys. And what kind of newspaper are you?

257
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:34,280
You know, what else do you plagiarize? You know, the Guardian's going to pretend they don't know

258
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:41,320
about this, they'll please, please. All right. Yeah, what do we have? That time for Carmen still.

259
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:49,320
Hey, this is Carmen Tyler, and I have no idea what I am doing. So I'm trying to do pod cast.

260
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,720
Just go to Carmencast.putshow.com.

261
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,320
Bring on the Velcro.

262
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,920
I don't have a DB. I just get bored releasing, and my brain goes in million just different

263
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:07,080
directions at one time, which is just absolutely crazy. No one was being inside my head.

264
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:15,240
Oh my, guys, that is so crazy. I can't believe you just said that. That's K-A-R-M-Y-N-K-A-S-T dot

265
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:23,000
putshow.com. Yeah, it was, uh, yep. Just inside the satellite window too, Carmen. There you go.

266
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,800
So for those of you on serious satellite stars 102, I'll be back tomorrow with more from the

267
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,320
Curry Cottage in the affluent suburb of Surrey, the United Kingdom.

268
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:39,320
Since there was Blender. Hey, I got some misinformation about Guy Fox Day. They're so nice to

269
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:46,200
hear all the Brits calling in, help them me out. And boy, I'm actually learned quite a bit about this.

270
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,800
Let's see, uh, let's hit and check this first one out.

271
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:04,360
Um, I think a little problem can be worn up by Guy Fox. Uh, I have to have them telling the

272
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,600
links fee, but there's absolutely brilliant program, uh, done by Richard. How many of you

273
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,960
know about Blender isn't the, uh, so you're not my own ever crush on, um, in the rocket

274
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,040
powered off the top here. Yeah, it's probably myth busters to show your talk. No, wait,

275
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:22,200
mate, Richard Hammond's not on that. Um, Brainiac, maybe that's the one. Get a brilliant

276
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,640
program on Blender. How was it, Paul? The seat was possible on us, um, anywhere, panic

277
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,240
and so I'll send you our link. This is, I've got to put a thought like, you know, while it was on

278
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:37,720
me mind and, uh, you're always saying, you know, in the phone calls, so just a bit, bye. Okay, so that was

279
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,800
uh, just part of, um, the fact that this is, it was not last, uh, or over the weekend, uh, was

280
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:50,280
it, uh, Brittle of, uh, Saturday. It was, um, it's November 5th, so it's still coming up. And you know,

281
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:56,040
how you remember it, uh, apparently there's a little rhyme that has been around since 1700's

282
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,680
or something or other, uh, that helps people remember when Guy Fox Day is. When I move,

283
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:05,640
remember the sister, no, then the jump had a trace and it's lost. I see no reason why I

284
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:12,840
got a trace and it should never be forgot. How cool is that, man? Some dude came up with like,

285
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:19,080
you know, so this happened in 1700's made up this, this silly rhyme. And it's carried fourth

286
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,320
for hundreds of years. Remember, remember, remember the fifth of November, every school child can

287
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,680
remember that. I got to come up with one of those. I really got to have one for me, so that

288
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,560
in a couple hundred years, someone will still be saying, remember, remember, the days of flavored

289
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:38,760
splendor. Hi, Adam, this takes me to tag in. Do you play on the city that are really

290
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:43,800
an awesome old dream or how about you on? Yeah, this is turning out to be a really interesting

291
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:49,640
show, isn't it? Yeah, you know, this, I don't remember what Jeff said. Anyway,

292
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,800
this stuff you're talking about, one for a night, and it is a celebration of birth,

293
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,840
or it's turning out to have the parliament and stuff, but it's some specific November. And there's

294
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:05,880
like, parents and nurse urans and stuff about it, right? Remember, remember, the sister's November,

295
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:11,480
the dump had a trace and plot. I know of my reason why dump had a trace and she'd never be

296
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,840
forgot, or she'd ever be forgot or whatever it is. Anyway, and sorry, let's go for the time

297
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,240
from just before Halloween until the middle of November, so that's all the banging and stuff

298
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:27,560
that you're hearing. So, if you can't find the sister, you're not missing it. So, still up the show,

299
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:33,560
still harder. Bye. I shall speak to Captain Dan, if that is possible, the fifth of November,

300
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:40,120
what's the date on that? Oh, me, yeah. Oh, we have a message incoming, just as I'm grabbing the

301
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:57,800
blackberry. What's the message here? That's from Ron. Hold on, he's still up. Poor guy. I'm old. He's

302
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:06,920
really old. I don't know how he does it. Okay, what's I looking for? The date November fifth is a Sunday.

303
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:12,280
Okay, so I know Dan would be available, but I have no idea. So, the plan would be to see if we can

304
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:21,480
fly at night during Guy Fox Day and film it, of course. If I've seen no reason why we couldn't,

305
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:27,240
I don't know what the rules are if there are no tabs, notice to airman about flying over certain

306
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,920
areas on a night like Guy Fox night, but if someone knows the rules, Captain Dan will know the

307
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:40,920
rules. Something else have been getting a lot of email about. Let me just see if I have an example of

308
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:50,920
one of these. Hold on. Oh, boy, do I love Gmail? So easy. Just do a search for Splenda. And here we go.

309
00:28:50,920 --> 00:29:05,880
Oh, this, I think this was it. Now that I actually had to talk to the, the original sales

310
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:15,240
weasel, Greg Man, it's his account. Now, we had expected people to shoot. I get, did I delete that?

311
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,080
What the hell was I thinking? We had expected people to, you know, to question Splenda because

312
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:28,040
there are some questions about its ingredients, about health and safety of, of using the product.

313
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:35,960
And it wouldn't be fair, you know, to do a promotion like this, which is already incredibly

314
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:42,680
successful because people actually really like the product. You know, it would not be fair to ignore

315
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,720
that. So even though I expected to talk about a little bit later on in the campaign,

316
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:56,760
there is concern about Splenda and your health using this product. And it's stuff that

317
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,360
resonates throughout the internet. And so we talked to the Splenda fall and said, you know,

318
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,960
so what do you want to say? You know, what's going on? And they said, look, point everybody to

319
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:11,560
SplendaTruth.com. Now, of course, it's not going to resolve anything for those of you who do who

320
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,640
believes different and want to believe that, you know, different, I can't convince you.

321
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:22,760
But, you know, there's a lot, this is, Splenda is a member of the Johnson and Johnson family of

322
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:29,560
products, a family-owned company, mind you. So this is, you know, this is a true American institution.

323
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:36,520
They are not going to put their customers at risk. And then, and so at SplendaTruth.com,

324
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:43,480
there's, I basically went straight to the FAQs. They've got Splenda and safe to safety testing sites of interest,

325
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:51,320
about Splenda FAQs. And so, you know, their questions like a Splenda brand,

326
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:56,440
Swedener made from sugar, which yes, super low, or Splenda brand, Swedener's made from sucrose

327
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,080
through a patented multi-step process, blah, blah, blah, it's Splenda Natural Answer No,

328
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,520
sucrose, the highly intensive, sweetener, using Splenda Products is not natural.

329
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:13,560
It's a no calorie sweetener. Then it has all these questions about, let's see, what's something

330
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,880
interesting. It's Splenda Absorb by the body, I kind of like that one. The vast majority of

331
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,120
sucrose is not absorbed and passes through the body unchanged. I don't like talking about this about

332
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:29,800
any kind of food to be honest, but, okay, it says the guy smoke on a fatty. Some sucrose is

333
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,120
passively absorbed, but is not broken down for energy and rapidly excluded from the body. The

334
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,360
small amount that is absorbed passes very quickly through the body and is excreted in the urine.

335
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:44,520
There's no accumulation of sucrose in the body. So you can go check that out if you so wish.

336
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:53,640
My question was not in the FAQs, which is, you know, does the French vanilla actually affect

337
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,640
the taste of your.

338
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:16,040
That's the voice, Mel number. It's a phone in anything you want. Hey, in the city,

339
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:21,320
Podshow is sponsoring in the city, this huge independent music event, which is going on

340
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,280
going on for years up in Manchester. And of course, Ron and I couldn't go with the real

341
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:31,320
bummer because dude, I had the plane lined up and you know, ready to go, but we had this big

342
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,920
meeting today. So we really could not go up. Jill Mills is up there, along with our buddy from

343
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:43,640
Green Dragon podcast, and they're checking in. Hi, Adam, it's Gil from my cafe in the 50th.

344
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,520
Adam is really a day from Gini's by size bonus.

345
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,760
Basically, we've been paired up, but she know, and we've been going around seeing loads of

346
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:56,360
them. And in my role, they know full book for the network. I've got been picked for you if you want

347
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,360
to look at me. No, I'm not given true. Okay. All right. Well, basically, I've been going around

348
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:04,360
I've been caught with all the A&L people who are here looking to sign the book on label.

349
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:09,800
This is Jill Mills. She's something Mel's man. I got to tell you. She knows everybody in the music

350
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,040
business. It's like, you know, it's like, you know, Bonna walks in the room. Yeah, I was like,

351
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,720
Jill. She's like, I'm believable. Everybody knows Jill. And she's, you know, and now she's going to tell

352
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,320
us who, you know, who's been signed. I mean, this is she is so deeply embedded into the into the

353
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,920
scene. And you have it on the hospital, see that these bands will be getting signed. We'll be

354
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,720
hearing a lot more of them in the future. Okay. So get your pen from parts ready and move some

355
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:41,880
turn. Terry Naomi, the answering machine found. Brick a large, friendly fires. You get all this down.

356
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,480
I'm just a twang. Number one phone. Clark, you can't. And the strange death of liberal

357
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,160
England. I have it on good authority that most of the fans will be getting signed as they

358
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,240
will. I've been most of the fans, but we both have been going home. We have been running our shows

359
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,480
rugged on behalf of each of you. You guys have been, yeah, you stop with the B.T. Pot show. You

360
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:05,800
guys, you didn't get enamored. Hammered. Hammered on our dime. You're up there smoking crack.

361
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:11,160
Getting drunk. Screwed around with the bands. All in the name of progress of music.

362
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:35,160
Yeah, I've been working really hard. I'll tell you. These 12-year-olds are killing that.

363
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:41,320
Nice. And that's just doing it part-time. The highlight of the week for me so far is seeing a band

364
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:48,040
called Bokey. Oh yeah. I'm just amazing trio. I have some Japan. Not a girl band. They were absolutely

365
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:53,480
fantastic. I know I've got a list came from the me of bands that I've fallen in joy. I'm not going

366
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,280
to be negative about talking about the crap band at what the point. But I'm with you. I mean,

367
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,840
did you say crackbuff? Yeah, it was one of the first gigs we saw. Wasn't that Bokey?

368
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:07,000
And what I have to say to you, the thing that's not me is, you know, when bass players, basically

369
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,840
they play their instruments, like they're as close. Which is what they're there. You might have

370
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,640
had a scene like so wide before bass guitar. Most of the ensemble was on about four and a half

371
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:21,160
or so. Unfortunately, we did try and interview them afterwards. But they speak about three words of

372
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,880
English between them, so it became actually interesting. Well, if it was the best word they knew

373
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,080
was yes. Yeah. Which please me no one will have questions I was asking. You'll fail. No.

374
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,840
I think we should keep the rest of history. Yeah. So people can find us on folks like reason that

375
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:42,600
works. There we go. Okay. So there you go, Adam. Yeah. That's me, GD. Um, I'm Mateo Mills.

376
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:48,440
We're fortunate for in the city. Oh, we good. You guys rock. But you know what really pisses me off.

377
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,880
So, you know, here we are sponsoring this event. We've got to chill up there. We've got a whole crew

378
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:03,880
up there. We're preaching the gospel about the pod safe music movement. And then, you know,

379
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:10,200
our two stars, it sounds like they're talking through a fucking, you know, my first microphone.

380
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:17,880
My first podcast recorded. It sounded like absolute crap. What was that? Can we, can we get these

381
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:24,200
people some decent recording equipment? All right. We're officially looking at November and December.

382
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,960
So I think I'm within the boundaries of the law to play Christmas song.

383
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:57,960
I know that famous Christmas tree. Yeah. People are shopping for them loved ones.

384
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:11,960
I'm making plans for a Christmas freeze. Learning all goes by and the length of night.

385
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:29,320
And then we have to wait another year. What event? We did Christmas. What a wonderful one.

386
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:41,320
This one we did. We never feel blue. We make all our dreams come true. We're Christmas.

387
00:37:41,320 --> 00:38:02,360
We're everything. It was time to bring out the good people. I just look around now and you'll see here.

388
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:13,720
Everybody's a nice and full of life. And they give to those who aren't me.

389
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:28,120
Yeah, we're everything. Christmas. What a wonderful one. This one we did.

390
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:40,760
We never feel blue. We make all our dreams come true. We're Christmas. We're everything.

391
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:54,120
So I'm going for the summer to the spring. I'm taking a nice year until then.

392
00:38:54,120 --> 00:39:07,560
It's Christmas again. What is everything? Christmas. What a wonderful one.

393
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:18,600
This one we did. We were never feel blue. We make all our dreams come true.

394
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:24,120
Christmas. What a wonderful one. This one we did.

395
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:30,840
We never feel blue. We make all our dreams come true.

396
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:40,360
Christmas. What a wonderful one. This one we did.

397
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:45,080
We made all our dreams come true.

398
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:51,080
Christmas. What a wonderful one.

399
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:59,640
This one we did. We made all our dreams come true.

400
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:14,920
We're everything. It was time to bring out the good people.

401
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:21,080
Christmas. What a wonderful one.

402
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:28,680
This one we did. We made all our dreams come true.

403
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:36,200
Christmas. What a wonderful one. This one we did.

404
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,880
Christmas. What a wonderful one. This one we did.

405
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:55,560
Yeah, Lady Patricia just stuck her head around the door saying, come on to bed and I said,

406
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,560
hey, it's you.

407
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,560
It's you.

408
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,560
I'm a pod say for peace.

409
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,920
If every day we're Christmas, just within legal boundaries of playing a Christmas

410
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,560
tune, myself and post legal boundaries that is November.

411
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,560
It's okay.

412
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,960
And of course, you can buy that song in the pod tape music network 99 cents.

413
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,200
All proceeds go to UNICEF, it was a very successful last year.

414
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,400
I'm sure we can do it again all over again this year and your support is welcomed.

415
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,400
I love that song.

416
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:27,040
You know, you Christmas songs, this is, I think this is a real keeper because you burn out

417
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,040
on that shit, right?

418
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,880
You just were like, oh man, I don't want to hear it anymore, but just playing it again

419
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,600
is like, yeah, you know, it works, it just, it still does, it's still got it.

420
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,880
All right, buddy, I got a couple things to wrap up here, then I'm going to hit the, hit

421
