00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Delta Sierra Charlie three three four a warning. This podcast is not family safe. So either turn it down or jam those buds deep into your ear.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is the band scamper from the scamper podcast as scamper.net.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's right. We're rock band. We do podcasts. We're awesome. We do it all.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We really do. And what we have for you today is our own tip for Adam Curry's Metro sexual moment.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Especially tailored for all those guys out there in bands. Guys, if you're in a band, make sure you thoroughly cleanse your penis in between groupies. Otherwise, you'll be stuck with that low self esteem smell.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And it gets all over your sheets. It's really disgusting fellow. So thank you.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm gross. Not worth it.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hey, by the way, do you think that Adam Curry still gets the groupies?

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Of course, he still gets groupies. He's Adam motherfucking curry.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hey, do you think he still gets the thresons with Kurt Loader?

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Fantastic. It's Adam Curry.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hey, man. Who needs groupies when you've got titties?

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's a feedback friday everybody.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Delta Sierra Charlie is on.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I started in front of me.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Taking in all she could see.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's a feedback friday everybody. Delta Sierra Charlie is on.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I started in front of me.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Taking in all she could see.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Cracking on her sugar cane.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I leaned in and I caught her name.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So big.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So big.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Sierra lands through her arm.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And I miss her over hands.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Though she's on.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
When I'm glad to hurry, she'd've been gone.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So big. Oh, plus is on.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So big.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So big.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So big.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Saved it.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So big.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
She's got an ocean, and I feel so old

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
She's looking all around, so I've been just so old

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So big, so big

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So big, so big

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And once again, I've watched her go

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Down the stairs through the next picture

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I felt the sand breathing from my glass

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Time was slipping, so I had to move fast

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Come to where I said it in the room

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm so sorry, I never said I know

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
She gave a smile and we talked till dawn

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I felt the ocean, so big

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So big, so big

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So big, so big, so big

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So big, so big

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So big, so big

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So big

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Now that is a Friday kick off song for the Charlie

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Hey everybody, Daily Source Code

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Thank you for tuning in, pressing play

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and getting with it, oh this

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I didn't even a chance to announce you're going to be on the show yet

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Go take your coat off and come back

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I just came in

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I know you did

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Well, so I said it was a feedback Friday

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I have lots of feedback that I'd like to get to

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But Patricia did promise you would drop by today on the show

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,320
today on the show. And the reason for that is because I asked her because you know how long

66
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,360
have I done this show now without her? Like, once last time you're on the show, huh?

67
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:59,480
Huh? A couple weeks ago. Three weeks ago, at least three weeks ago. Two weeks ago. Yeah.

68
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,160
Show is boring without you. Oh. Yeah. Look, man, you completely set up. Look, I got your

69
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,360
mic set up. I got your headphones, check the headphones, see if they sound good. Check them

70
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,480
up. Yeah. Hello, hello. Can you hear me? Yes. Can you hear yourself? Yep. Yeah. There you go.

71
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,800
Very professional. Just the microphone. You got to move it. As a singer, you're used to that.

72
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,400
A finger. Yes. For those of you who don't know, this is my lovely wife, Patricia, who gave

73
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,800
me the avocado and shrimp with cocktail sauce yesterday. You love the cocktail sauce. Yes,

74
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,280
I do. Yes, I do, huh? Welcome. Thank you. What are we going to talk? We're going

75
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,720
to talk about some stuff today, right? Yeah. And you know what? Yesterday. No. Yeah. Yes,

76
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:50,200
then when we had dinner, I started something and you said, I said, I said, she should be quiet.

77
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,840
But what was it? I don't know. I look, you're supposed to be the professional for

78
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:01,400
an instigator. No, I don't know. No, I don't know. No, but see the thing is, is it was funny?

79
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,160
This is what I'm going to get when we get my chair. You want to chair? No. You want

80
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,720
to sit down? No, I'm young. You're old. Yes. No, the thing is, what I learned from the last

81
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,240
radio show is if you have a guest on, you don't want to, and this is what everybody does

82
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,440
at every interview is they talk in between either commercials or the records or something

83
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,680
else. And then by the time, okay, let's talk about that. You know, it's like then it's

84
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,800
not spontaneous. It's not funny. It's not interesting. No, I didn't even say it, but I started

85
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,000
it and you said, save them for tomorrow. I think it was about the grannies. That now that

86
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,680
was the, you know, I call them the grannies. Yeah. And you know why? Do you know what happened

87
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:45,520
with the, well, it's the Grammy Awards. Yeah. It was on the same time in the States as idols.

88
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,720
Yeah. As I, or American Idol. Yeah. Twice as many people watched American Idol as

89
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,440
watching the grannies. But I have to say it was a bit boring. Yeah, of course it is. It was all the

90
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,080
same people we've seen for 20 years on the damn show. It was always the same and it's like goodness.

91
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,360
Yeah. Yeah. It was extremely boring. And the version we saw last night on Sky, half of the show

92
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,400
was cut out. We didn't see Mariah Carey perform. We didn't see that. Oh, she did perform. Oh,

93
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,880
I did that cut her out. I don't know because it wasn't high definition. Oh, no, it's boring. And

94
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,280
you know what? Always Mary J. Blitz always has to sing with somebody. Do a do it. And she's

95
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,120
ever forever. For whatever. Well, she there again. I didn't see her last night. We're seeing

96
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:34,240
so off key. Oh, Mary J. Blitz. It's me nauseous. Yeah. And she's not even that bad because she's all over

97
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,600
the place. You know, the only thing she is, she's she's she's just got she's interesting to watch.

98
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,840
Yes, she has to move and get here. But that's okay. So that makes it valid. But now it's still.

99
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,360
But as a singer, you know, it's a little bit exaggerated. I'll really know. Yeah, because it's always a

100
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,000
little bit too high what she sings and that she's a little higher. It's better to sing a little bit

101
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,840
to low than to high. To high is a little Sydney. I think that too high all the time. And then

102
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:09,280
what is also my problem when I'm watching is and it's also with movie stars. You know,

103
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:16,480
they're great, they're fantastic. They have great, they have a great attitude in movies or on stage

104
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:23,040
or on the video, no matter who they are in the stars. Yeah. Then when they call their names out,

105
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:30,640
when they have a when they win the war. And when they win a war, suddenly they're just idiots.

106
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:39,520
They don't wait to go. They have these. They have these like, I'm not worthy kind of shoulder hanging

107
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,720
you know down. They walk like like idiots. Well, let me let me ask you something. Have you ever

108
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,880
suddenly they're not, you know, that's actually in that good and that talents at any more.

109
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:56,880
What is that humble? They're being humble. They're humble because oh, I don't deserve it. Oh, I don't deserve it. Yeah, right? Well, first of all

110
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,880
They probably don't deserve it

111
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,320
Okay, but I've never won an award in a group in a big setting like that if you I don't know what that's like

112
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,880
I don't know if how I would be more stand up. I got finally

113
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:14,880
Yeah, that's true. I'm about time. Yeah, you know

114
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,880
Yeah, that's true, but it was you know, and it's wonderful. I would be very happy

115
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,080
But you know that's stupid stupid. I'm not worthy kind of you know

116
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:34,440
I didn't like the telecast last night just for the the television direction, which was done by Ken Erlick who I know and I've worked with who I think is just not a good

117
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,440
Television director

118
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,320
No, no, no, I mean it's like you can you can almost see you know like and congratulations

119
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,360
Mariah, who do we see Gwen Stefani you know the way around and it was the fun the funniest thing

120
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,320
There was this awesome awesome drum battle beat this was really good

121
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,320
I thought this was amazing. You know me in the drum cadence with the with the bands. I love that

122
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,320
So it was Kanye West and Jamie Foxx

123
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,000
Yes, right. I mean it was fantastic

124
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,920
choreography everything it was just outrageous and it was like just boom boom and from from Kanye back to Jamie and then you know

125
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,240
And then these like I think five or seven girls came out and they dance and that's guys came out and they dance

126
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,600
Charlie there's yeah and and and just the very very end at the very end

127
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
So this like this is big climax

128
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,760
What's the shot that Ken Erlick calls for a shot of James Taylor?

129
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,920
Yeah, it was like it was a shock. I was like, you know, I was seeing the hippest most movable people on the earth

130
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,360
You know Kanye and Jamie Foxx very talented and then all of a sudden and James Taylor talented

131
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,360
But it was like

132
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,840
Oh my god, who's that it's like what was that? No, it was a shock man. I would. I don't know

133
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:49,360
But you know, we're idiots. We're we're television and music idiots. So that's that should bothers us

134
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,440
No one else cares, huh? Believe me. It doesn't matter the moment if you irritated that's entertainment

135
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,960
Yeah, absolutely and and that you know

136
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,520
There's so many people who are irritated by by this podcast

137
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,680
That's entertainment. I think it's wonderful my friend

138
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,040
The comic strip blogger your friend too, by the way. He's done some very nice cartoons of you

139
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Oh, that guy

140
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
Oh, he hates me

141
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
He gives me wrinkles

142
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,960
He sure does give you wrinkles. Yeah

143
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I this I played for you yesterday

144
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,280
You unplugged

145
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,360
Everybody

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,840
Whereas it hears I played this for you yesterday. I just want to play it for the listeners because it was so cool. We know what it is

147
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,840
We're talking about this thing here. Check this out

148
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,080
Hi Adam

149
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,440
It's your old buddy Leanne from the list of these bitties bitty cast

150
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,840
I wanted to send you this audio comment to praise you for your metro sexual moment

151
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,720
Women have been discussing this thing for centuries and that's why we smell so nice and look so pretty all the time

152
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,280
It's about time for you guys to have your own avenue to personal grooming

153
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,280
Thank you for helping all our future boyfriends fix themselves up

154
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
For the record pink is good

155
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,040
We like

156
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,800
On another note we thought you might enjoy this moment of bitty cast we recorded it Jim Caruso's cast party in New York

159
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,720

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,840
Like that magazine. Yeah, exactly. How come a guy like Roger Smalls doesn't work for a paparazzi? Yeah, magazine

202
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,560
celebrities and do you know some celebrities? I guess I'm watch TV and

203
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:58,400
The real celebrity and I heard that and we know that because we experience that

204
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,640
It's a new thing

205
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,000
They take pictures, but they want to take bad pictures of you. Well, of course. That's a new thing of course

206
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,160
See you know years and years ago

207
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,080
Yeah, remember that how they can't be that long because you're so young

208
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,680
Talk referral would like to have a wonderful great beautiful picture composition even while that is a great picture

209
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,520
You know you're proud of that no

210
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,520
It's not it doesn't work like that anymore

211
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,480
You're proud of it if the ugliest picture that you can make from somebody you take from somebody

212
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,080
Well, that's the you know why though. Yeah, it's entertainment. You just said yourself it's entertainment

213
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:39,680
Yeah, but that's what here we are again. I said at the last time that's because we're in a

214
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
Totally different mood these days

215
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,560
You know people want to hear and see

216
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:52,480
Nasty things and set faces sure from from the start sure actually rosin bar was on it still rosin bar

217
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,440
I don't know whatever. Yeah, I guess whatever. Well, she was on a morning show this morning in the UK

218
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,880
Really she's I think she's plugging a sort of a children

219
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,760
DVD that she made is the dog okay

220
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,880
You know it's beautiful weather. He sees all those dogs in there. Oh, he wants a garden play

221
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,160
But then he could take him out this little and she said something

222
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:21,920
That she she talked to her rabbi and time ago long time ago couple years ago and that really changed her

223
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,920
Because he she asked him something about

224
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,000
I don't know and he said you know what we're going to start start

225
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Changing yourself and be a little bit nicer

226
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,680
Because she was asking something about believing and I don't know what he says first start to be a little bit nicer

227
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,280
You are not nice

228
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,800
That's what she said. Yeah, yeah, she was nice and then she actually she said yeah, he was right

229
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,640
I wasn't nice and lots of people around me were nice

230
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:59,280
And even her stand-ups were not nice nice people laughing because they were not nice. Yeah, but exactly, but yeah, I think that right now

231
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,240
There's a lot of frustration

232
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,200
People are upset about a lot of things and it's much safer

233
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
Much much safer to attack

234
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:18,320
Someone other than the problem that you may really be dealing with I see this and I know how this happens because I'll be reading an email an example

235
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
I'll be reading an email

236
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,240
I'll be doing something oh, and it's probably something that's irritating me. That's what it happens

237
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,040
And if there's an interruption and someone asked me something

238
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:34,640
I'm still in that in that mood. I'm short. I'm abrupt. I'm not nice. No, that's right. Exactly. You should kick my ass

239
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,640
And those ends said you know

240
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,880
She bent a couple of people around her that are

241
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,480
Not nice and she's much nicer her kids are nicer and

242
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,920
And

243
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:54,720
And it helps she said and if if everybody would do that and think about it the whole world will be a little bit nicer because at the moment

244
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,040
People are not nice right the sea. I don't believe that will ever happen the world has never been a nice place

245
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:05,280
But it's never been a nice place come on if we start with ourselves humans are a bunch of murdering

246
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,160
Thieving flandering beings what I said the last time isn't it more and more?

247
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:17,040
I think I still remember people were nice. No, that's because there's more and more newspapers to read

248
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,320
There's more and more channels to see it has to be filled up with something

249
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,880
That's what it that's what's happening. Well, maybe that makes us grumpy because we know too much

250
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,720
There's something that I want to read this to you

251
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,240
Daywiner wrote something I don't often quote something from him, but I think he's right about this where is it?

252
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,640
This is more about the internet than anything else, but it's the same thing

253
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,800
most of the vocal people on mailing lists web logs and wickies are more fans than creators

254
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,680
It's as if we confuse the baseball players with people who sit in the stands watching a baseball game

255
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,400
Baseball game sure both wear caps and want their team to win, but one actually does something about it while the others express an opinion

256
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,440
Yeah, there are a lot of fans but relatively few people who actually do anything

257
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,240
And that's really yeah, you know, these people who write in the sun in the mirror and all these you know

258
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,200
What I don't even call newspaper tabloids. Yeah, you know, I think they're all basically fans

259
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,480
You know, they don't actually do anything. They don't actually you know, have any

260
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,520
Any capability usually don't have any capability in the areas that they bought off

261
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:29,520
Smart or you know, well, that's what okay, so the writing something smart stuff has been replaced with getting a scoop exactly and the scoop is then then

262
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,800
You know, that's your journalistic credentials if you if you and sometimes of course you create a scoop out of nothing or

263
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
Miss information that that

264
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
changed to

265
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,360
Yeah, but that's okay because the good thing about the internet is you can turn it off

266
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,760
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah, it was a Harrison Ford we saw on

267
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,800
On the John Stuart show yeah, yeah last night. Yeah, and he said he's a very analog guy

268
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,240
You know internet computers. He says he thought it was all just one one big boy to create a whole

269
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,040
New demographic of people have to come to your house to fix it. Yeah. Yeah

270
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
Pretty good, too

271
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,840
I got to do a commercial here. All right. Okay. Oh, this is really this is great. I didn't even told you this

Really that's interesting come to us come to us

284
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,720
Now like you very happy

285
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,360
Well so exactly so people have all had all different kinds of reactions and they feel that you know as progressive

286
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,440
podcasting is

287
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,080
That this is not on the same level of change

288
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:23,120
And so and it's just been yelling and shouting and name calling and all kinds of really really aggressive

289
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,240
Language about this and what I've said from day one is hey look you know

290
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,080
Here's a company who stepped in and says okay. I'll try and support this podcasting thing

291
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,240
Let's see if it works for us. We'll try and figure it out and we have an ongoing dialogue well yesterday

292
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
They actually ordered it up a whole new campaign

293
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
and they don't want

294
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,720
I can't I can't really say what happened to the people who came up with this idea

295
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,720
Of this come of the cult commercial yeah, but now they want something completely different

296
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,280
They want the listeners involved so they really list within two months this is huge company

297
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:01,040
All of a sudden said you know what we do have to change advertising why because if I listen to it

298
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:08,560
I it feels like I can trust it really yeah, what is it? I'm totally oh that's very interesting

299
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,120
Yeah, that's very interesting. It sounds very trustful

300
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,440
Really yeah for me that's fascinating

301
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,680
So you would buy you would buy earth you know what or did you understand what it is what earth link is?

That's okay. I mean, I'm not gonna ridicule you you don't have to know about internet stuff well

304
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,840
Like a sort of provider. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, so you trust them because of that that's very interesting

305
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,560

That's true. Yes, for us

411
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,520

That sounds like...

475
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,440
Let me finish.

476
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
Oh, okay.

477
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,760
However, comma, however, when something happens to Heather Lockleer, I start...

478
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,760
That's your girl.

479
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,760
I pay attention.

480
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,760
Yeah.

481
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,760
What the hell happened there?

482
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,760
Well, Adam, she's free.

483
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,760
Dude.

484
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,760
Dude.

485
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,760
Don't you love Heather?

486
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
Yeah.

487
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,760
What's so nice.

488
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,760
Everybody likes her.

489
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,760
She's in the forest.

490
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,760
It seemed like, you know, it was like the...

491
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,760
Well, what's the matter?

492
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,760
I don't have...

493
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,760
It's gone every time.

494
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,760
Well, then stop.

495
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,760
No, because if it's on the...

496
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,760
It's still not.

497
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,760
It's gone.

498
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,760
Hey.

499
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,760
I don't know.

500
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,760
No.

501
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,760
What do you mean?

502
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,760
Um, yeah.

503
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,760
I'm back.

504
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,760
Okay.

505
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,760
Yeah.

506
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,760
Then touch the wire.

507
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,760
I will not touch the wire.

508
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,760
I touch it on purpose because I didn't hear anything.

509
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,760
Don't touch the wire.

510
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,760
But anyway.

511
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,760
Yeah.

512
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,760
She's so nice, isn't she?

513
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,760
Everybody says she's...

514
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,760
Maybe that's why she was only in Boston legal for three episodes or something like that.

515
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,760
Yeah.

516
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,760
Why?

517
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,760
Maybe because, you know, shit was hitting the fan.

518
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,760
I don't know.

519
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,760
I mean...

520
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,760
What is it?

521
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,760
What?

522
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
I don't know.

523
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,760
Why do guys not...

524
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,760
I guess she kicks him out every single time, right?

525
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,760
That's the way.

526
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,760
You don't know that.

527
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,760
Because she's not telling.

528
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
Yeah.

529
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
And Cheryl Crow split from Lancelot.

530
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
Yeah.

531
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,760
Well, that is a surprise.

532
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,760
I have to laugh when I see Cheryl Crow because I met Cheryl Crow.

533
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,760
I'm going to say 1988.

534
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,760
Yeah.

535
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,760
When Michael Jackson was doing the bad tour.

536
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,760
Yeah.

537
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,760
And she did the backups.

538
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,760
Yeah.

539
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
And I went to Kansas City.

540
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,760
Yeah.

541
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,760
And she had...

542
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,760
Remember Steve Stevens, he was the guitar player.

543
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,760
Yeah.

544
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,760
And it was like the really tall black hair or wavy black hair.

545
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,760
Yeah.

546
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,760
Really long hair.

547
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,760
That was Cheryl Crow.

548
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,760
And she was completely different attitude.

549
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,760
It's so remote.

550
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,760
Email punk music.

551
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,760
No, no.

552
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
No.

553
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,760
Really like hard rock punk.

554
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,760
Yeah.

555
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,760
With long black.

556
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,760
I think she had the long black hair.

557
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,760
But remember there was also there was another chick on stage with him.

558
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,760
Yeah.

559
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,760
Yeah.

560
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,760
Yeah.

561
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,760
So really good.

562
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,760
Wasn't the guitar or...

563
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
No, that was Steve Stevens.

564
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
I don't know.

565
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,760
Even with another girl who played some musician.

566
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,760
Yeah.

567
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,760
Yeah.

568
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,760
Yeah.

569
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,760
But she was doing back then.

570
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
But she was a nice girl.

571
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,760
She fantastic girl.

572
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,760
Very sweet.

573
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,760
But nothing like what I saw last night on the ground.

574
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,760
He was like, oh, whatever.

575
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,760
She exercised like crazy.

576
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,760
Oh.

577
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,760
But I mean, I didn't see her that naked when I met her.

578
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,760
No, but...

579
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,760
But just the whole...

580
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,760
Just the whole...

581
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,760
I don't know.

582
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,760
It's just different.

583
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,760
Yeah.

584
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,760
Just different.

585
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,760
Something's going on there.

586
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,760
Yeah.

587
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,760
Bono's the same though.

588
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,760
Amazing.

589
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,760
That guy.

590
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,760
Just...

591
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,760
I can't believe that guy.

592
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,760
The way he thinks...

593
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,760
See now, we were just talking about, you know, like crazy.

594
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
Don't know.

595
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
I'm not worthy.

596
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
He's the opposite.

597
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,760
Yeah.

598
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,760
You're right.

599
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,760
That's not good.

600
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,760
He wins an award.

601
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,760
He turns around to the audience and goes, hey, everybody.

602
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,760
Yeah.

603
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,760
I won.

604
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,760
Of course.

605
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
Like we would do.

606
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,760
Yeah.

607
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,760
Now, but this is too much.

608
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,760
Okay.

609
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
This is too much.

610
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,760
He is so full of himself.

611
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,760
Yeah.

612
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,760
I don't know about this guy.

613
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
I don't know.

614
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,760
And I think he...

615
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
He means...

616
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,760
He means...

617
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,760
He means well.

618
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,760
Of course he does.

619
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,760
And he did good things.

620
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,760
I think so.

621
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,760
Mm-hmm.

622
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,760
I never know what...

623
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,760
What's really...

624
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,760
What is it?

625
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,760
Why not do it?

626
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,760
What is he doing?

627
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,760
Sounds good.

628
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,760
Yeah.

629
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,760
It sounds good.

630
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,760
And he's talking to everybody but doesn't help.

631
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,760
I don't know.

632
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,760
It doesn't help doing nothing.

633
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
That's for sure.

634
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
That's true.

635
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,760
That's what we said yesterday.

636
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,760
I mean...

637
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
He's trying.

638
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,760
At least he's trying to be...

639
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,260
Nice.

640
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,260
Yes.

641
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,260
Correct.

642
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,260
All right, baby.

643
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,260
I got to go.

644
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,260
We got lots of people who got to go to work and stuff and do important things.

645
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,260
I was listening to our crap.

646
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,260
So...

647
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,260
Will you listen to my show on Valentine's Day?

648
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,260
I will.

649
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,260
Which I'll be bringing to you from the way of the Yorker.

650
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,260
All right.

651
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,260
Okay.

652
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,260
Okay.

653
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,260
Thanks for stopping by.

654
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,260
Well, thank you for having me, my darling.

655
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,260
Okay, baby.

656
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,260
Is tonight the night?

657
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,260
People are puking with me.

658
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,260
Yeah, I know.

659
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,260
Okay.

660
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,260
All right.

661
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,260
I love you too.

662
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,260
I love you too.

663
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,260
Everybody.

664
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,260
See you on...

665
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,260
