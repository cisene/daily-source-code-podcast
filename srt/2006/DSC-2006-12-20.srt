One show at a time.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,040
In a world, we're men, we're comfortable shoes, and not much else.

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,280
Prancing around in his underwear and his egg boots in the morning.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,880
That's not right.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,880
Where Dutch pop stars are stopped by paparazzi.

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,800
I don't think I've seen it this bad.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,240
And where the world seems to have gone crazy.

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,440
Hey, John!

She walks squeeze her by.

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,560
It's squeezing the butt.

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,960
One man stands out.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,920
Oh, I said sail with some splendor.

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,320
But look, nasty.

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,560
One man heads the call.

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,840
Wait a minute, aren't we, uh, as another, uh, how was it?

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,960
One man delivers an entertainment show just about daily.

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,920
Wow, okay.

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,720
That is story.

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,360
I just have to organize my thoughts because it's so much.

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,720
Story, Adam Curry, as Adam Curry.

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,320
I'm sure you enjoy it.

24
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,560
But Trisha Pie, as the pop star.

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,320
This guy has the greatest.

26
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,440
He's got a good good ass.

27
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,400
Tied.

28
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:22,960
Beautiful.

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,080
When do I get to meet asshole?

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,840
I even missed her ass.

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,960
She's ever, I mean, he's not gay.

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,160
And Christina Curry, as McColle called good.

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,160
But Christina was actually a all alone.

34
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,560
Is a drama filled with heart-pounding action.

35
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,400
As she calls me from the airport, she says,

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,160
okay, I forgot I'm not medicine.

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,000
But you have to know, as, uh, as someone who has some minor cardiac issues,

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,400
heart medicine is pretty important to take with you.

39
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,200
A story that has everything.

40
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,960
Obsessions love, uh, disappointment, sorrow.

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,920
It really, the emotions run the gamut.

42
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,520
And you can only find it in one place.

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,240
Delta, Sierra, Charlie, five, one, six.

44
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:21,760
Sometimes an atoms on a loan and he needs his love right there on the microphone.

45
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,200
So here she is, yes, the lady Patricia.

46
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,120
The say to have some better than one.

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,400
And with this angel from above,

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,840
there's nothing that they both can't do.

49
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,280
I make you while this dream has come true.

50
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,720
So grab your ear buds and jam them in.

51
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,920
And let the fabulous show begin.

52
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,880
It's Adam and Patricia.

53
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,320
Yes, Adam and Patricia.

54
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,760
Adam and the lady Patricia.

55
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,040
We're usually generated content as become times person of the year.

56
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,880
One man has taken the reins to lead the revolution.

57
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,560
Guiding podcasting to new horizons has only an experienced pilot care.

58
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,960
The, uh, what are we moving from the east side of Gilford?

59
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
No, the west side of Gilford to the east.

60
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Uh, let me just check again.

61
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,240
Now, from the east side of Gilford to the west side of Gilford.

62
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,800
Oh, hell, somebody load a BF-5, 16.

63
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:37,360
Researchers in New Zealand have proven that there is a link between cannabis and mental illness.

64
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,000
Oh, yes.

65
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,640
Has anybody seen the map queue the music?

66
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:53,840
I a-va-a-la-a-a-la!"

67
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,020
Though you see what I see, do you see a lot?

68
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,680
I do you see?

69
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,240
Do you understand?

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,240
She said that life was through the little land.

71
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,480
Do you see?

72
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,760
Do you see?

73
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,760
We're up to the sky and in a lap

74
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,760
Do you see what I see?

75
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:29,760
All the stars start dancing the night with a tear

76
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,760
As we go through a kite with a tear

77
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,760
This break is a kite

78
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:46,760
I send a little lamb to the shop for more

79
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,760
Do you know what I hear?

80
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,760
Ring through the sky and shop for more

81
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,760
Do you know what I hear?

82
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,760
All the stars start dancing the night with a tear

83
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,760
As we go through a kite with a tear

84
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,760
This break is a kite with a tear

85
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,760
As we go through a kite with a tear

86
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,760
As we go through a kite with a tear

87
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,760
This break is a kite with a tear

88
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,760
As we go through a kite with a tear

89
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,760
As we go through a kite with a tear

90
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,760
This break is a kite with a tear

91
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,760
As we go through a kite with a tear

92
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Let's bring you something to go

93
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,760
It's not like you know where I am

94
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,760
You know where I am

95
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,760
You know where I see where I am

96
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,760
I saw you here

97
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,760
Set the key to the people that flew away

98
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,760
Hales and you are high say

99
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,760
Day for peace and people that flew away

100
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,760
Oh, listen to what I say

101
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,760
Hales and you are high in the sky

102
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,760
He's sleeping in the night

103
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
You know where I am

104
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,760
You know where I am

105
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,760
Hales and you are high in the sky

106
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,760
Hales and you are high in the sky

107
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,760
Hales and you are high in the sky

108
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,760
Hales and you are high in the sky

109
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,760
You know where I see where I am

110
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,760
Hales and you are high in the sky

111
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,760
Hales and you are high in the sky

112
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,760
That's what I am talking about

113
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,760
Gilpar do you hear?

114
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,760
Gilpar do you hear what I hear?

115
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
I could have been me

116
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,760
That's exactly what I was going to say

117
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,760
It sounds so much like one of your songs from the 80s

118
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
Just kind of your range and your singing

119
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760
Yeah, yeah fantastic

120
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,760
In fact there is a song you did that sounds like it

121
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,760
Wasn't it from that stupid Disney album you did

122
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,760
It was a song on there that sounded just like it

123
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,760
What the hell was it?

124
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,760
It is a certain middle part that sounds very much like it

125
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
What?

126
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
Oh boy

127
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,760
Oh boy

128
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,760
Oh boy she is doing it in the lowlands

129
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
Sorry

130
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,760
Oh it's probably one of the albums here

131
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
One of your massive library of albums

132
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Ladies and gentlemen, the one and only Patricia Pye is back

133
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,760
I've got Napster so I love searching for songs

134
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,760
It's our favorite song

135
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
I love this song

136
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
We should play it

137
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,760
Hey baby, how you doing?

138
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
I've been to the moon and back

139
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
That's how it felt

140
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,760
Let me just see where we left off the conversation

141
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,760
Last time we were talking was that when I picked you up

142
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,760
Yeah, and we came back after the rehearsals

143
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,760
And I told you to story about falling off the...

144
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
Yes, you had to sing

145
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,760
So hitting the other stool and hitting my kick

146
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,760
Kidney's right

147
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
So it was wonderful

148
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
Right

149
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
So you got better

150
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
I got better

151
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,760
It always was a little bit sensitive

152
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,760
I could feel it

153
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,760
So I asked the guy not to squeeze my kidneys

154
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,760
Don't touch the kidneys

155
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,760
I wouldn't know where to find your kidneys if I was looking for it

156
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,760
But he does

157
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Every time he was I could feel it

158
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
So we did that different

159
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
We had a different routine there

160
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,760
I think we did very well

161
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,760
Okay, so wait a minute

162
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,760
So I got to reset the stage

163
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
Your Patricia is doing dancing with the stars

164
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
Actually I just did dancing with the stars

165
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
Because we're done

166
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
It's two special year and episodes

167
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
To be aired in the low countries

168
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,760
And one is on second day of Christmas

169
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,760
And the other one is New Year's Eve

170
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,760
And so you had to do two dances

171
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
One was a wall

172
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
And one was a somba

173
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,760
And you did this with a professional dancer Remko

174
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,760
Who is not gay?

175
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,760
No, he has a very tight ass

176
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,760
That's so best, he is a professional dancer

177
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
He is not gay

178
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,760
They always think the dances are gay

179
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
I have no idea

180
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Very devoted I have to say

181
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
Very, very

182
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
You got to be man

183
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
If you want to be professional in that field

184
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,760
And he is a national champion

185
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
And also a world champion

186
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
Exhibition dance

187
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,760
Is that like the forbidden dance

188
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
Exhibition dance is beautiful

189
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,760
Exhibition dance is like all you can free style it

190
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,760
And no dangers and looks beautiful

191
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,760
So now all the gossip television magazines tabloids

192
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
They're calling the calling your family

193
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
They're calling me on my private line

194
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,760
I know

195
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,760
And so of course all we can really tell them

196
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,760
Is well, once you just go listen to the podcast

197
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,760
If you really want to know what's going on

198
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,760
So we have the exclusive here of all the dirt

199
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,760
We're not allowed to talk about the actual results

200
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
But I have to say I was very proud of myself

201
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,760
And I know now that I'm a Samba girl

202
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,760
Samba girl

203
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Yes

204
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,760
This me, Samba's me

205
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,760
You really like this dancing thing, don't you?

206
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,760
It is so much fun

207
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
I didn't know

208
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,760
I didn't know when I started this but

209
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,760
It is I have to say it's a lot of fun

210
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
And for the women ladies

211
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,760
You're losing weight like

212
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
Now let me just tell you

213
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,760
You came home

214
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,760
Yesterday, God you look so hot

215
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
Thank you

216
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,760
Yeah, your ass was tight

217
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,760
Not that it isn't tight otherwise

218
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
But you lost pounds

219
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
I lost six pounds in one week

220
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,760
Yeah, I believe it

221
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
So with the other week, I think all together

222
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,760
Maybe seven, seven and a half

223
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,760
And you lost it all in the right places

224
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,760
Because everything that's supposed to be nice and plump

225
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
It's still nice and plump

226
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Oh, baby

227
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
And we were happy to see each other

228
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,760
Yes, we were

229
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,760
Mr. Happy was happy to

230
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
Yes, baby

231
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,760
So it was a good week, it was a good experience

232
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,760
And you know, all the attention

233
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
And all the paparazzi was there

234
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,760
And of course, it's in a good way

235
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,760
Because we had different situations

236
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
Paparazzi and gossip

237
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
They all hate me

238
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,760
No, they don't

239
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,760
They hate me

240
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,760
No, no, no

241
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,760
They think it's fun to make fun of me

242
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,760
No, no, no, I mean look at David Beckham

243
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,760
Do they hate him?

244
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,760
No, they were talking about him too

245
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
After a

246
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,760
Well, you know, after he lost the world cup

247
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760
Yeah, they hate him

248
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,760
It's a little bit of news of that moment

249
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
And then they forget all about it

250
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
You're so interesting

251
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,760
I can I can tell you

252
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Because everybody's asking about you

253
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Oh, tell me more

254
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,760
Every talking about me about you

255
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,760
And especially I noticed that they're still talking about the Adam's family

256
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,760
And that thing

257
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,760
What flipped out your bathroom?

258
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
Oh, you mean

259
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,760
Oh, no, bath a robe

260
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
Yeah, this was on a reality show that we did

261
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
And they're the men

262
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,760
So they're jealous of my penis

263
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
They're very jealous of your penis

264
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
Yeah, it's a stuff like that

265
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,760
So how are you doing?

266
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
I'm doing fine

267
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,760
And how's the Adam doing?

268
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,760
Hamdo, are you guys happy?

269
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,760
Yeah, I know why you're happy

270
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,760
That's what they say

271
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,760
Yeah, and that's the typical man

272
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,760
That's the only thing they can think of

273
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,760
You sure they don't mean my wallet?

274
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
It's not the plane they're talking about

275
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,760
Oh, really?

276
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,760
Yeah, that's okay

277
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
Well, that's pretty cool, I guess

278
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,760
So, but yeah, it was fun

279
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,760
What I wanted to say

280
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
It was a lot of fun to have all those

281
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,760
People asking about you, of course

282
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,760
And all the attention was nice

283
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,760
Actually, I did this time I enjoyed it

284
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
I enjoyed it

285
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,760
Oh, no, they gave me a kick

286
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,760
Now, did I understand that they've asked you to be on the series

287
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,760
The regular series of like eight different dances

288
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,760
To really compete in the real competition

289
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,760
Yeah, and actually the way I feel now

290
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,760
I would love to do it

291
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,760
But that's not now

292
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,760
So it's going to be in a couple of months

293
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,760
And who knows what I'm doing then?

294
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
So I don't know

295
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
Well, I think if they can

296
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,760
It's quite a compliment

297
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,760
If they can work it out logistically, I think you should do it

298
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
I think I can, I can do it

299
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
If I don't, don't worry about you

300
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
I'm not going to see

301
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
You have nothing to worry about

302
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
I mean, I'm in the condo in San Francisco

303
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,760
Me, my hookers, and my computers

304
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
You know, I'm all set

305
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
My hookers

306
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,760
Yeah, you know, it's absolutely right

307
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,760
I really missed you when I was in San Francisco this time

308
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,760
It was really hard because

309
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,760
You had great parties

310
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,760
We had some fantastic parties

311
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
I knew you would love to be

312
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
Then we had the Clienter Perkins party

313
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,760
Which you would have hated

314
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
The hell is that?

315
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,760
Oh, parcel force

316
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
Yeah

317
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
It was like, you know, it was

318
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Mainly men

319
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,760
And it was all bankers and stuff

320
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,760
And people who wanted to, you know, get richer than they already are

321
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,760
So it was a good network

322
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,760
It was good for Ron and I

323
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,760
Yeah, it was a networking party

324
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,760
You could have been my trophy wife

325
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,760
That would have been cool

326
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Okay

327
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,760
Because, you know, there was just like

328
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,760
I'm very good at that

329
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,760
There were no good looking chicks

330
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
Oh

331
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,760
Except for Marta was there

332
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
No Marta

333
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
And Ray Lane's wife is very beautiful

334
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
Yes

335
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
And

336
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,760
Let's see, then we had our Christmas party

337
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
The Pod Show party

338
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,760
Yeah

339
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
It was a lot of fun

340
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,760
We had Santa

341
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
We, you know

342
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,760
We had an after party at a club

343
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,760
Yeah

344
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,760
Oh, I know closet to sex

345
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,760
Well, I certainly wasn't invited

346
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,760
If there wasn't

347
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,760
We weren't in a closet

348
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,760
I jumped out of the closet

349
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,760
Years ago

350
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,760
What are you talking about

351
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,760
Please

352
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,760
So, and after which went to the club

353
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
Tell me about

354
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,760
There was a club right

355
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,760
So we had the W Hotel

356
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,760
Which is a great hotel

357
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,760
I mean, you know, it's kind of typical

358
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,760
Modern hotel

359
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
And it was great food

360
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
Which I think is

361
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,760
It's not very typical anymore

362
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,760
The people serve food during a holiday party

363
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
In the United States

364
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
It's more like you have a drink

365
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,760
And then

366
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,760
Yeah

367
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,760
Yeah, yeah

368
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,760
So, most of the time

369
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
Finger food

370
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
Well, we had a buffet

371
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Oh, yeah

372
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
We had a full buffet

373
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,760
And that was good

374
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,760
And then the club

375
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,760
Downs I forget what the name of the club was

376
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,760
And, you know, so we went in

377
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,760
And we got a court like a VIP corner

378
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,760
And, you know, and got champagne

379
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,760
Yeah, we were in the club

380
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,760
And we had some real people who could really dance

381
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,760
Yeah, so we didn't look like a bunch of fucking gigs

382
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,760
We had Kevin Appes

383
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
We had Kevin Appes

384
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,760
From the high-fee show

385
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
From the high-fee show

386
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,760
From the high-fee show

387
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,760
From the Tony Costas

388
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,760
Are you out of your fucking mind?

389
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,760
You didn't dare

390
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,760
No way

391
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,760
You're so good in your John Toffors

392
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,760
I think

393
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,760
Oh, yeah, here it comes

394
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,760
Yes, yes

395
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,760
No man, it was outside smoking

396
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,760
Spliff for you talking about

397
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,760
I don't know

398
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,760
And, after that, you didn't even

399
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
No, there was no dance

400
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
No, I don't know

401
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,760
I don't know

402
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
I don't know

403
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
I don't know

404
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
There was no dance

405
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
No, I was home at

406
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,760
By 1245

407
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
I mean, this is the big party night out

408
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,760
Wow

409
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Wow

410
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,760
I don't know

411
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
You know

412
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,760
And that's all what happened

413
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,760
No, and then we had, well of course

414
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,760
We had a lot of work

415
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
We were doing a lot of stuff during the day

416
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,760
And then there was Ray Lane's

417
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,760
60th birthday party

418
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,760
I think he would have liked that

419
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
Mmm

420
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,760
Yeah, was at the table

421
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,760
With Tim Shriver

422
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
From the Kennedy clan

423
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,760
His mom started

424
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,760
Check this out

425
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
I didn't know this about the guy

426
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,760
His mom

427
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,760
Yunus

428
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,760
I think

429
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,760
Yeah, Yunus Kennedy

430
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,760
Shriver

431
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,760
I don't know

432
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
I'm started

433
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
I don't know

434
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
So Maria is his sister

435
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
I think Maria Shriver

436
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,760
Okay

437
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,760
Because Schwarzenegger

438
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,760
Was supposed to come, couldn't come

439
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,760
Oh, that's a pity

440
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,760
I think the Cardinal of California was there

441
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,760
I mean, really, some interesting people

442
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
Right

443
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,760
And so Tim Shriver's mom started the special Olympics

444
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
And he's been

445
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,760
I guess the co-chair of the special Olympics for 20 years or whatever

446
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
And that's basically what he's been doing with his life

447
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,760
Wow

448
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,760
Yeah, and you learn a lot about people

449
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,760
And Ray Lane has been doing all kinds of stuff

450
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,760
For the special Olympics for years and years

451
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
So it was kind of interesting

452
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
Very interesting

453
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,760
Yeah, and they had good food and

454
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Nice content

455
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,760
And the platters

456
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,760
Yes

457
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,760
Yeah, you told me that

458
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,760
It was like

459
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,760
Oh yes

460
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,760
I'm the great

461
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
Pre-tender

462
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
Pre-tender

463
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,760
Pre-tender

464
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,760
Almost second

465
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,760
Wait, wait, let me see

466
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,760
I didn't pull you down this time

467
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,760
Yeah, yeah, usually

468
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760
It's always six is fingering

469
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,760
See

470
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,760
Yeah, well, like Abba, right?

471
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,760
Okay, let's see if we can

472
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:12,760
Yeah, I'm the great

473
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,760
Pre-tender

474
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,760
Pre-tender

475
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,760
Pre-tender

476
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,760
I'm doing well

477
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,760
Doing well

478
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,760
I need you

479
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,760
It's such

480
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,760
I pretend too much

481
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
I'm lonely

482
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,760
I know the lyrics

483
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,760
Okay, anyone

484
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,760
One can say

485
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,760
But they have a lot of other

486
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Yeah

487
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
Other massive hits

488
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
But it was kind of fun

489
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
But I can't

490
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
I don't know

491
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
Well, what?

492
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Do you know this one?

493
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,760
Oh, okay

494
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,760
Challenge

495
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,760
Challenge

496
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,760
Hold on

497
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
I don't know

498
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,760
You're running

499
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
I were bugging out

500
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,760
Because we actually knew most of

501
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
So, do you remember this one?

502
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,760
This is a classic

503
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,760
Do you remember this one?

504
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
This one?

505
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
Yeah

506
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,760
It's 12 at a time

507
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,760
See?

508
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,760
Oh, it doesn't

509
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
There's another one

510
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
It doesn't

511
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
Here's another one

512
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
The plotters did a lot of

513
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,760
This isn't

514
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,760
It's sad that we can't really share

515
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,760
These with our public

516
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
Because it's illegal

517
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,760
Whether it should be a part of your musical education

518
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
Oh, what we're doing in that

519
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,760
My two loved ones too

520
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,760
Here it comes

521
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,760
Okay, so I'm just reminding you

522
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,760
Some of the plotters songs

523
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
Do you remember this one?

524
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
It's come back

525
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,760
Oh, no, but there's more

526
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,760
There's more

527
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,760
These guys are

528
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,760
Yeah, I mean the plotters

529
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
You want to know plotters

530
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
How about this golden oldie

531
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
On this fantastic

532
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,760
20th century masters

533
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,760
The millennium series best of the plotters

534
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,760
The magic touch

535
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,760
Yeah, those were good times

536
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,760
Aren't they Patricia?

537
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
Do you remember the days of the plotters?

538
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,760
Yes, or is it?

539
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
I don't know

540
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
Two young for the plotters

541
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,760
But still we've got more on this fantastic compilation

542
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,760
You never, never know I can

543
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,760
Oh, no

544
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
And then of course there's the one that everyone loves

545
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
So sing along to on their karaoke machine

546
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,760
It's this classic

547
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,760
Oh, no

548
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,760
Anyway, so

549
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,760
Indeed, yes

550
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,760
So there was basically one guy from the original plotters

551
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,760
Who had a wig on that I think was made

552
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,760
One plot

553
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,760
It was a plot and I think that he had a wig on

554
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
Which was the hair of the four other guys

555
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
Who?

556
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,760
It was like a cap man

557
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,760
And he was in an 80

558
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,760
But he was like, hey, remember us the plotters

559
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,760
And then he had like young guys

560
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Who could really sing their ass

561
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
Oh, well, that's nice

562
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
Of course

563
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,760
And he had an ugly, ugly, ugly ass white band

564
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,760
I'd like balling guys with stringy hair and shit

565
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,760
But it was good

566
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,760
And they played the temptation songs

567
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,760
It had a whole bunch of things

568
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
They really had that

569
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,760
So it was a party

570
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
It was a party

571
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,760
Our friend test

572
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,760
Yeah, it was definitely cool

573
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,760
And your ray, of course, was severely disappointed

574
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,760
That you wanted there

575
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,760
And he really wants to make Christina too

576
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,760
I'm disappointed too now

577
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,760
Dude, I mean listen, we got hang out with this guy

578
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
He's got a fucking G5 jet

579
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
Great

580
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
He's got rays on man

581
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
Come on, we got a wave

582
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,760
He was flying over the dense floor

583
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,760
Yeah, no

584
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,760
Yeah, well you were apologize

585
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
Now you were excused on me

586
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,760
I had a lot of fun

587
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,760
And I'm very happy to hear that you have fun too

588
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,760
Who'd have me

589
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
I had the most fun yesterday

590
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
Before you came home

591
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
When you're parents

592
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
First of all, your dad is a trip map

593
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,760
So I'm sitting here

594
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,760
He comes up here and walk in the studio office

595
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,760
And he'll look at the console

596
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
I did a big thing that he built for me

597
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
Which I love

598
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
And he knows that

599
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
And this thing has to fit up

600
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,760
The staircase to the third floor

601
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,760
It's a dozen dry now

602
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Well, he had measured it

603
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,760
And he said, if he saws this piece off right here

604
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,760
Yeah

605
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,760
Then the total length is 60 centimeters

606
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,760
Which of course gives it more than enough room

607
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,760
To get it up the stairs

608
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,760
Yeah

609
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
So he's been up here

610
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Like every half hour saying, can I start sewing?

611
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,760
Yeah

612
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,760
Dude

613
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
It's like, oh my shit

614
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,760
What are you doing?

615
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
He said, well, you could just take all your stuff

616
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
And put it over there

617
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,760
And like, dude, look at this spaghetti of wires

618
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,760
I said, don't come here

619
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,760
It starts sewing

620
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,760
Sorry

621
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
How about Friday?

622
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,760
Because I have to go to, well, we have a holiday party in a shortage

623
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,760
The London office has a party on Friday

624
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,760
Am I inviting?

625
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
Of course you were invited

626
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,760
If you want to come, yeah, I'd love you to come

627
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
All right

628
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,760
You don't really want to come

629
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,760
What do you want to go without me?

630
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,760
Well, yeah, it's an office party

631
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
Oh

632
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
That means

633
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
Nothing

634
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,760
Oh, yeah

635
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,760
You're more

636
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,760
It's like a...

637
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,760
Well, wait a minute

638
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,760
For the folks on serious satellite stars 102

639
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,760
If you want to come to the office party

640
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,760
Then you'll have to download the podcast

641
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
The dailysourcecode.com to hear

642
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,760
To hear the rest of the story

643
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,760
Okay

644
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
Now we're doing lunch first at 1 o'clock

645
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
Just for the for the peeps

646
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,760
Then at 4 o'clock

647
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,760
Some of the people who are working full time at the office

648
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,760
And a couple of the folks

649
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,760
Then

650
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,760
All of the people who signed up with the network have been invited

651
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,760
In the UK

652
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
They're all coming in

653
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,760
So that'll be at 4 o'clock

654
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
So it'll be kind of a full day

655
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,760
You may not want to be a part of that

656
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,760
Anyway, so your dad kept coming up

657
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,760
And I said, how about Friday?

658
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,760
He said, no, that'll be too late

659
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
So you're leaving Saturday

660
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
No, no, no, I have to saw now

661
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,760
So I've barely been able to keep him away

662
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,760
From sawing the desk in the two pieces

663
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,760
But the funniest thing

664
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,760
Was yesterday

665
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,760
Your dad had emptied out the entire refrigerator

666
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
He was resetting the shelves

667
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,760
And your mom freaked out

668
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,760
Yeah

669
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,760
I mean, I should have, I should have video taped

670
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,760
It was so, so fun

671
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,760
Our so funny, I know

672
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,760
It was absolutely hysterical

673
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,760
Once this starts with each other

674
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,760
And once my mom gets mad

675
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,760
No, then it's all over

676
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,760
That is quite

677
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,760
I know

678
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,760
I'm not like that

679
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,760
If I had gone ahead and cleaned out the refrigerator

680
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,760
And changed the shelving without your approval

681
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
I think

682
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,760
Well, I do what you would say

683
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,760
What's he doing?

684
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,760
No, you would have said, what the fuck did you just

685
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,760
Yeah

686
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:10,760
All right, let me play a little song here

687
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,760
This is

688
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,760
There we go

689
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,760
I got somewhere else to be

690
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,760
I'll be leaving here

691
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,760
It's 6 a.m. to see my family

692
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,760
All my sweaters they've been packed

693
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,760
Bit of cold

694
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,760
Won't make me crack

695
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,760
Once I get there, I don't know

696
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,760
I don't care how I'm coming back

697
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,760
Cause I would walk a thousand miles

698
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,760
I would walk a thousand miles

699
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,760
Through the snow rain

700
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,760
Or bitter cold to be back home

701
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,760
For Christmas

702
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:02,760
I've been gone too long to say

703
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,760
But I'm coming anyway

704
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,760
Anyway, I can't leave this town

705
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,760
And get back home today

706
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,760
But I'm coming anyway

707
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,760
Anyway, I can't leave this town

708
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,760
And get back home today

709
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,760
Let the snow fall through the air

710
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,760
I got eight long hours to spare

711
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,760
I'll be waiting at the airport

712
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,760
Bar for three but I don't care

713
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,760
Cause I would walk a thousand miles

714
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,760
I would walk a thousand miles

715
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,760
Through the snow rain

716
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,760
Or bitter cold

717
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,760
To be back home for Christmas

718
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,760
But this long flight

719
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,760
Don't bother me

720
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,760
Three man and shepherd's came to see

721
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,760
The baby born this morning

722
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,760
Lows away from their locality

723
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,760
And angels sing in clear patty

724
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,760
Lucia

725
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,760
The Christ is coming here

726
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,760
And they'll play with no strangers

727
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,760
The way that's still

728
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,760
The time and to find me

729
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,760
You know we found me

730
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,760
So I would walk a thousand miles

731
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,760
I would walk a thousand miles

732
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,760
Through the snow rain

733
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,760
Or check out lands

734
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,760
A traffic chance

735
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,760
And I would walk

736
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,760
A thousand miles

737
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,760
I would walk a thousand miles

738
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,760
Through the snow rain

739
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Or bitter storms

740
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,760
To be back home for Christmas

741
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,760
I would walk a thousand miles

742
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,760
I would walk a thousand miles

743
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,760
Through the snow

744
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,760
The rain

745
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,760
Or bitter cold

746
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,760
To be back home

747
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,760
For Christmas

That's from 2004

751
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,760
Isn't it though?

752
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
I can just imagine that in

753
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,760
Can you imagine having a husband

754
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,760
To do that?

755
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,760
Can you do that?

756
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,760
Can you do that?

757
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,760
I wrote you

758
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,760
You take your dress off

759
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,760
And rub you

760
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,760
And I would lay on the piano

761
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,760
Of course

762
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
And I would listen

763
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,760
Oh, wouldn't that be great

764
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,760
Yeah, I wish I could do

765
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,760
I'll lay on top of your laptop

766
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
If we had our fucking piano here

767
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,760
Then I could do it and I could pretend to play

768
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,760
We have a piano

769
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,760
Yeah, but piano will do it

770
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
I mean it has the automatic stuff

771
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
Can we just get it here?

772
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,760
We're going to put it here

773
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,760
No, we'll see

774
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
We need a different house

775
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,760
Oh, my piano

776
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,760
I want my piano

777
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,760
Yeah, we should do that more often

778
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
The

779
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
Sing along

780
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,760
The best of his

781
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
Yeah, I'd be kind of funny

782
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
No, I mean we could make it into

783
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,760
It's kind of like Saturday night live

784
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,760
Yeah, so we actually know all the songs

785
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,760
And we could do

786
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
What other songs do we know like

787
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,760
Good old stuff that we actually know

788
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
I don't know, I'm going to check that CD

789
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,760
What are you doing?

790
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,760
What are you careful?

791
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,760
It's a big jump there, baby

792
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,760
But just getting off of the bar stool

793
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,760
You need a whole, oh, you have your CD

794
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,760
I don't have your CD

795
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
Let me see if I got it, he would you make it

796
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,760
I got it downstairs

797
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,760
While you're doing that, I want to tell you about a new sponsor

798
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
On the Daily Source Code

799
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,760
It is for the movie

800
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,760
Sony Pictures movie

801
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,760
The Sony Pictures

802
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,760
The Motion Picture

803
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
Stomp the Yard

804
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,760
And this is from the same company

805
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
I guess it also from Sony Pictures

806
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,760
who sponsored the show with Little Man

807
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,760
Remember we looked at the trailer for Little Man

808
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,760
Yeah, and it turned out to be a huge hit

809
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,760
It was like number one movie

810
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

811
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,760
So now we're so successful

812
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
We're not from potions

813
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
What else does that do?

814
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

815
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,760
We're really

816
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
And Tony Costas of Costas World

817
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,760
Is doing an episodic podcast

818
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
About the movie

819
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
Which you'll want you to check out

820
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,760
It's called Stomp the podcast

821
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:43,760
find it at stompthepodcast.com, and let me see, I think, I think you still has the first

822
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:50,520
episode up, and yeah, that's the one where he has the candid conversation on black

823
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,360
college life, black Greek organizations, and the impact it has on culture, and of course

824
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:01,680
it's all about the upcoming release, Stomp the yard, and Splenda, are you done yet

825
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,160
because I can do commercials all day? Splenda, who challenge you to figure out what your

826
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:12,440
flavour is by combining wonderful Splenda flavours, you know what Splenda, you know what Splenda?

827
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,680
No, you don't want Splenda, is it?

828
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,560
No, what do you say? Thanks for listening to the show.

829
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
No, I don't.

830
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:28,200
I know, clearly, Splenda is, it's the sugar substitute, oh, of course I know that.

831
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:34,400
You do know Splenda, yeah, it's so sweet, it's very sweet, you don't need that much.

832
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,400
You don't need much, no.

833
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,040
No, no, no, no, I know where they are.

834
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:44,480
Well, they have no, in Hazelnut, French Vanilla, and one other flavour, which I can't remember.

835
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
You haven't tried that?

836
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,480
No.

837
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,800
You should try that, because what people are doing is they're mixing the flavours together.

838
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,800
Oh, nice.

839
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,480
Yeah, but I agree, you don't need a whole packet, a whole packet is way too much.

840
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,480
Yeah.

841
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,120
Okay, I know where it is, it's in kitchen downstairs, the CD.

842
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
Oh, okay.

843
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,480
Want me to get it?

844
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,480
Right now?

845
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
No.

846
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,960
Uh, uh, uh.

847
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,960
Give me heaven cover me.

848
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,720
That's it.

849
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,720
That's it.

850
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,240
From a brand.

851
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,080
Ah, yeah.

852
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,880
Ah, see, it's it's from Berlin.

853
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,880
Yes, oh.

854
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,880
Yeah, it was Berlin.

855
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,160
Okay, it was from my album with all the movie songs.

856
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,120
Oh, that's the one.

857
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,840
Was it give me heaven?

858
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,840
Give me heaven, I thought.

859
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,840
Seven.

860
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Yeah.

861
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,440
Can we just chat about my life?

862
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,940
No.

863
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,440
Was it on a night?

864
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,440
No, cover me.

865
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,440
I think it was called cover me.

866
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,440
Oh, I see.

867
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,440
But I mean, the album, time of my life,

868
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,440
that's why it was on.

869
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,440
Right, exactly.

870
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,440
I don't.

871
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,440
I don't.

872
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,440
I've only had the single here.

873
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,440
I've never been to me.

874
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,440
Don't.

875
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,440
I don't think you're in Napster.

876
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,440
It sucks.

877
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,440
Let me see.

878
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,440
If you're in Napster, baby.

879
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,440
What shows up on a do your name?

880
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,440
I do have a house over here.

881
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,440
You know, which what do you have from the other.

882
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,440
You want to play that again?

883
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,440
Give me that.

884
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,440
That's so fucking funny.

885
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,440
No, this has never been to me.

886
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,440
Oh, it's on top of it.

887
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

888
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,440
A second one.

889
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,440
All right.

890
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,440
You got to set it up while I loaded up.

891
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,440
You got to tell me you got to tell me.

892
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
I already did.

893
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,440
I haven't known.

894
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,440
Another one's heard the show, man.

895
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,440
Look, the half is hot, baby.

896
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,440
You got to tell me how to judge it.

897
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,440
Especially in the heart.

898
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,440
In the UK.

899
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,440
Yeah.

900
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,440
It was your all the time.

901
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,440
What was he doing here?

902
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,440
Yeah.

903
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,440
But anyway.

904
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,440
So people were asking me, do you know the half?

905
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,440
I said, yeah.

906
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,440
I know the half.

907
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,440
I sang with him.

908
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,440
I fucked him.

909
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,440
Nice.

910
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,440
I sang with him.

911
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,440
And my producer went to LA to record his voice.

912
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,440
And because I couldn't go that.

913
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,440
And that's the first one.

914
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,440
Then the second song is with half.

915
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,440
But anyway, my producer came back and he said, well, that was hard.

916
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,440
Together.

917
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,440
Yeah.

918
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,440
Because he thinks he's a better singer than he is.

919
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,440
Oh, boy.

920
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,440
So he was like.

921
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,440
All right.

922
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,440
Listen.

923
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,440
And constantly.

924
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,440
Hey.

925
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,440
Hey.

926
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,440
Yes.

927
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,440
And they just, you know, had to clean up a little tape.

928
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,440
No.

929
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,440
But we got it.

930
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,440
It's the half man.

931
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
Finally we got it.

932
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,440
We got to re-release this.

933
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,440
Yeah.

934
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,440
And I was his guy.

935
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
It's on the, on the track.

936
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
No kidding.

937
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,440
So he had to sing what I already sang.

938
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,440
It's the truth.

939
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
It's the truth.

940
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,440
Oh, yeah.

941
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
I love to you.

942
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:46,440
Because that's mommy.

943
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,440
And that's mommy.

944
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,440
Yeah.

945
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,440
I love to you.

946
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,440
Doesn't he do a, hey.

947
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,440
Just remember.

948
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,440
Yeah.

949
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,440
Everybody.

950
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,440
The half rock.

951
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,440
Yeah.

952
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,440
It was a.

953
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,440
Yeah.

954
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,440
Confused him for so long.

955
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,440
Now.

956
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,440
Oh, yeah.

957
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,440
I found someone to stand in our way.

958
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,440
It's kind of a disco.

959
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,440
He track.

960
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,440
Yeah.

961
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,440
And he was so off.

962
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,440
Yeah.

963
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,440
You have no idea.

964
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,440
I want to hear you guys rip it up.

965
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,440
Now with passion in our eyes.

966
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,440
I did.

967
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
It was pretty good.

968
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,440
I did all the back up, too.

969
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,440
All the more.

970
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,440
Yeah.

971
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,440
The core.

972
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,440
Tell me.

973
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,440
Yeah.

974
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,440
Okay.

975
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
He is the just remember part.

976
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,440
Yeah.

977
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,440
Yeah.

978
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,440
Yeah.

979
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,440
That's pretty good.

980
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,440
Can I skip the head for a second?

981
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,440
Yeah.

982
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
Let me know.

983
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,440
He has.

984
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,440
I'm here with time of my life.

985
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,440
I never feel this way before.

986
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,440
Somewhere you must really kill on this track.

987
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,440
I don't know.

988
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,440
I did six voices.

989
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:09,440
So that's all you.

990
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,440
Yeah.

991
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,440
Yeah.

992
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,440
No.

993
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,440
No.

994
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,440
I did it all.

995
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,440
Yeah.

996
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,440
Good time.

997
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,440
Oh.

998
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,440
That's funny.

999
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,440
That's funny.

1000
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,440
Yeah.

1001
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,440
It's nice to have that.

1002
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,440
Yes.

1003
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,440
Well, baby, it is good to have you back home.

1004
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,440
I look forward very much to a wonderful Christmas.

1005
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,440
And moving.

1006
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,440
Oh, I don't even want to think.

1007
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,440
What is the actual day that we're packing up, do you?

1008
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,440
The first week.

1009
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,440
We're going to pack.

1010
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,440
Yeah.

1011
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,440
And the second week.

1012
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,440
We're going to bring everything to the other house.

1013
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,440
Oh, boy.

1014
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,440
They're going to move everything.

1015
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,440
You know, I've started on changing all the addresses.

1016
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,440
Oh, I've started on the way.

1017
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,440
Yeah.

1018
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,440
I have changed that in the past week or two.

1019
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,440
All right.

1020
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,440
You know, it's going to be fucked up because you know the internet's never going to work

1021
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,440
on time.

1022
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,440
No.

1023
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,440
You don't didn't even check it.

1024
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,440
You have.

1025
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,440
You have.

1026
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,440
Uh, internet there.

1027
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,440
No.

1028
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,440
Well, the capability.

1029
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,440
Yeah.

1030
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
But you have to have it all connected.

1031
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,440
And it just takes fucking time.

1032
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
We're going to live in a mess in the first week.

1033
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,440
So you know that.

1034
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,440
Absolutely.

1035
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,440
Yeah.

1036
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,440
But you know.

1037
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
And the cats can't go outside for six weeks.

1038
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,440
Oh, no.

1039
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,440
I have to stay in some sense.

1040
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,440
I know.

1041
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,440
Excuse me.

1042
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,440
No.

1043
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,440
I don't want to think about it right now.

1044
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,440
Oh, I cannot stand.

1045
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,440
Yeah.

1046
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,440
You're still coming down from the sense coming down.

1047
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,440
Dancing with the stars.

1048
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,440
Yes.

1049
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,440
Okay.

1050
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,440
Dancing with a star.

1051
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,440
When do we get video?

1052
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,440
I want to share it with the world.

1053
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,440
That's a fashion.

1054
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,440
Honey.

1055
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,440
What?

1056
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,440
Video.

1057
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,440
Video.

1058
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,440
Yeah.

1059
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,440
I said.

1060
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,440
Video.

1061
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
Video.

1062
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,440
Just give me a DVD.

1063
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,440
Well, they.

1064
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
People want to see that shit.

1065
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,440
I know.

1066
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,440
I know.

1067
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
Um, I don't know.

1068
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,440
They're going to do the editing show right now.

1069
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,440
Yeah.

1070
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,440
We should re-release that man.

1071
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,440
That's good.

1072
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,440
I tell you.

1073
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,440
This could be a very big hit in the UK because I love the half.

1074
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,440
And Germany.

1075
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,440
And nobody has this track.

1076
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,440
No.

1077
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,440
Nobody has it with the half.

1078
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,440
Hello record companies out there.

1079
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,440
Yeah.

1080
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
You're already dancing right now as a big hit.

1081
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,440
You're right because of the of the musical.

1082
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,440
Yes.

1083
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,440
Why don't you call them from Kota?

1084
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,440
Why don't you call them say, dude, you mother fucker.

1085
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,440
Release this shit in the UK.

1086
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,440
And release it.

1087
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
I don't know if you can release it.

1088
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,440
So you tell them that I don't like that to do that.

1089
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,440
Yeah.

1090
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,440
Because.

1091
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,440
Well, you know, it's not going to make any difference.

1092
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,440
I mean, you could get on top of the path.

1093
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
Yeah.

1094
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,440
Because you are still.

1095
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,440
And curry.

1096
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,440
The ex.

1097
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
Very big big DJ.

1098
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,440
Who made Michael Jackson big.

1099
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,440
Oh, yeah.

1100
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,440
I would love to release it.

1101
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,440
I don't think you can do it because.

1102
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,440
Who wrote it?

1103
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,440
You can ask him.

1104
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,440
Give me the CD again.

1105
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,440
You can ask him.

1106
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,440
No, because it's not his.

1107
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,440
It's not his to give away.

1108
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,440
That's true.

1109
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
It would be who wrote it.

1110
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
Prevent.

1111
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,440
Denecola and Marko Markowitz.

1112
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,440
Oh, we have to call him.

1113
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,440
We have to call him.

1114
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,440
Hey, Denecola.

1115
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,440
I didn't call him.

1116
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,440
I didn't call him.

1117
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,440
I didn't call him.

1118
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,440
We're great to do.

1119
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
Yeah.

1120
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,440
So we can't release that.

1121
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,440
When you do these fucking covers man do something original.

1122
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,440
You got to do some original.

1123
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,440
That we can release it.

1124
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,440
I had another request from iridfontaine.

1125
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,440
Of course.

1126
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,440
Yes.

1127
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,440
That's my fontaine.

1128
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,440
What was his request?

1129
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,440
Well, he said actually he wants to make.

1130
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,440
He's a producer.

1131
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,440
He's a very good producer.

1132
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,440
You did the Robbie Neville stuff with him.

1133
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,440
Yeah.

1134
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,440
Danger.

1135
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
Danger stuff.

1136
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,440
And well, they had a couple of.

1137
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,440
World hits.

1138
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,440
Very good.

1139
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,440
With stuff they wrote or something.

1140
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,280
Yeah, you're up in my tie, and he's here.

1141
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,680
Hey, stop, read.

1142
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,480
Yeah, all those, well, I'm more.

1143
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,400
Is that still one?

1144
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,600
I mean, they ride great songs, too.

1145
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
Yeah, keep talking.

1146
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:58,760
And well, they, Eric said he wanted to make an album

1147
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,240
with me with a big band.

1148
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:02,840
That's good.

1149
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,960
Because we were talking about what I would like to.

1150
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,680
So it's just one thing I would love to try.

1151
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,400
Sex with another woman with my husband.

1152
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,240
Exactly.

1153
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,160
And that's end a beautiful, big band to album, which

1154
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,280
great, very chic music, you know,

1155
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,680
glass wine, piece of cheese.

1156
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,120
Oh, wine and cheese.

1157
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,920
Why is it cheese?

1158
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,160
Perfect wine and cheese.

1159
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,360
Yeah.

1160
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,600
You know, and a candle.

1161
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,920
And your ass.

1162
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,120
Oh, Adam.

1163
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,440
Yeah, I'm looking for my tie.

1164
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,160
That's so new to you.

1165
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,200
My tie is not naughty, naughty.

1166
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,480
My tie is not on that.

1167
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,480
It wasn't that big of a world.

1168
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,120
But dangerous.

1169
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,960
Well, dangerous not going to be on Napster.

1170
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,440
I'll tell you, they've only got him like a million songs.

1171
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,960
I mean, how many songs in the world have come out?

1172
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,960
Hmm.

1173
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,960
Anyone I'm saying?

1174
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,960
Yeah.

1175
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,960
Let me see.

1176
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,960
Danger.

1177
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,960
Eric is a whole bunch of dangers.

1178
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,960
Honestly.

1179
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,960
No.

1180
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,960
It's not going to be in there, baby.

1181
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,120
So do you want to do that with him?

1182
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,840
Well, you know, well, let's talk about it.

1183
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,840
I don't know what he is.

1184
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,440
But again, something that can't be really.

1185
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,240
Can we do original songs?

1186
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,640
Does that mean you can?

1187
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,720
Let's do original songs that you can really,

1188
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,440
part say, if you don't want money, you know,

1189
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,240
there are so many beautiful, beautiful ballots

1190
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,800
and beautiful old songs that still, you know,

1191
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,720
are gorgeous to sing.

1192
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:26,040
Yeah, but I'm just being selfish.

1193
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,960
I want to release something odd, say.

1194
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,200
So, okay, let's put it this way.

1195
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,040
You can do an album.

1196
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,520
Favorite is still misty.

1197
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,240
And there are so many beautiful misty.

1198
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,280
So why don't we do this?

1199
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,720
Why don't you, once you say yes, I'll record the album.

1200
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,640
And of course, yes, I talked to me, your manager.

1201
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,200
As your manager, I'm telling you what you can do.

1202
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,440
So I think you should, yes, you should absolutely

1203
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,920
should record an album.

1204
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,800
And but at least one, preferably a couple of the tracks

1205
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,920
have to be written.

1206
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,120
Written.

1207
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,680
If they write them, that's fine.

1208
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,360
But I want to be able to release them pod safe, which

1209
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,560
means, you know, they're probably not going to make any money.

1210
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,280
Well, they're beautiful new jazz songs and beautiful, you

1211
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:13,880
know, ballots, which you can sing the way we did that in the

1212
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,640
early days when we had the big bands in the beautiful.

1213
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,840
This is it.

1214
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,000
Real violence.

1215
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,560
No, see, it is wrong.

1216
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,560
Oh, it's over.

1217
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,560
Yeah, it's a joke.

1218
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:31,520
Now, this is football room dancers.

1219
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,400
Get on the floor.

1220
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,400
That's your dad's band.

1221
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,400
Enjoy.

1222
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,400
Yes.

1223
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,400
The John Pioor.

1224
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,400
They're all 17, 18 years old.

1225
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
Look at me.

1226
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,400
I miss helpless as a kid.

1227
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,400
I'm a tree.

1228
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,400
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud.

1229
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,400
I can't understand.

1230
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,400
I get dizzy.

1231
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,400
Yeah.

1232
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,400
Just holding your head.

1233
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,400
It's nice, baby.

1234
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,400
You're so good.

1235
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,400
Walk.

1236
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,400
Walk.

1237
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,400
Walk.

1238
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,400
Way.

1239
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,400
Oh, yeah.

1240
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,400
Yeah.

1241
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,400
Right.

1242
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,400
So, there are so many beautiful songs.

1243
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,400
Right.

1244
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,400
So, first we have to do the half release after the half release.

1245
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,400
The half.

1246
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,400
The half.

1247
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,400
Baby.

1248
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,400
The half is hot.

1249
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,400
He was in a couple of programs, a couple of shows here on the TV.

1250
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,400
And I thought he was very funny.

1251
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,400
Because he finally figured out.

1252
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,400
He figured out that, yeah, you're better be, you know, funny about yourself.

1253
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,400
And you know that thing.

1254
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,400
Don't take yourself so seriously.

1255
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,400
And he doesn't.

1256
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,400
You know the thing I showed you last night, which we can't exactly say what it is that video I showed you.

1257
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,400
Yeah.

1258
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,400
The project we're working on.

1259
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,400
We actually almost got the half to do it.

1260
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,400
Really.

1261
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,400
Oh, he could have done a good job too.

1262
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,400
Yeah.

1263
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,400
The problem is he has some commercial interests for a competing product.

1264
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,400
Yes.

1265
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,400
Yes.

1266
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,400
He does.

1267
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,400
You know what I'm saying?

1268
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,400
Yeah.

1269
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,400
So, unfortunately.

1270
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,400
Signed a contract.

1271
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,400
Yeah.

1272
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,400
Oh, you knew that.

1273
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,400
Well, that's good.

1274
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,400
So, unfortunately.

1275
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,400
The internet thing you mean.

1276
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,400
Yeah.

1277
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,400
He's doing this sort of internet commercial.

1278
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,400
I don't know if it's, no, no, no, no, no.

1279
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,400
That's something else.

1280
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,400
No, no, no.

1281
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,400
He has another commercial.

1282
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,400
Oh, yeah.

1283
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,400
Which is for a competing brand.

1284
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,400
Okay.

1285
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,400
Doesn't matter.

1286
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,400
Anyway, we almost had him.

1287
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,400
I was pretty sure.

1288
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,400
This guy is good too, right?

1289
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,400
Yeah.

1290
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,400
It's probably my favorite, my favorite.

1291
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,400
Let's not say anything.

1292
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,400
Yeah.

1293
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,400
All right, baby.

1294
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,400
It's been 45 minutes.

1295
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,400
Gotta stop.

1296
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,400
Okay.

1297
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,400
People have no patience for us after 45 minutes.

1298
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,400
No.

1299
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,400
Yeah.

1300
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,400
Okay.

1301
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,400
So, you want to say happy Christmas to anyone.

1302
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,400
Because I'm sure you won't come on the show before Christmas.

1303
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,400
Very, very merry Christmas.

1304
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,400
Well, you don't know.

1305
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,400
Maybe I'll just hop in.

1306
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,400
Merry Christmas.

1307
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,400
Beautiful days.

1308
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,400
Be very, very nice to each other.

1309
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,400
Good times.

1310
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,400
Good times.

1311
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,400
Like a candle for the people that you miss.

1312
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,400
And don't forget to buy the fabulous 20th month, 20th century

1313
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,400
Platters.

1314
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,400
Yes.

1315
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,400
Collection album.

1316
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,400
But are we going to back?

1317
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,400
Are we going to be back for New Year?

1318
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,400
Yeah.

1319
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,400
Yeah.

1320
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,400
For the New Year's, yeah.

1321
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,400
Then the two weeks that we're moving, I'm planning on doing the best of

1322
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,400
Charlie, which means people get to put together their own favorite shows

1323
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,400
of compilation of shows.

1324
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,400
Well, we're going to be all by ourselves, the three of us.

1325
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,400
Yes, we are.

1326
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,400
But we like it that way.

1327
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,400
Yeah.

1328
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,400
We like it.

1329
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,400
Very quiet.

1330
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,400
Nice meal.

1331
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,400
Hmm.

1332
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,400
Some snacks.

1333
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,400
Just enjoy.

1334
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,400
Oh, at him.

1335
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,400
Well, you can think of if you see my body.

1336
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,400
Oh, I'm trying hard not to do baby, but.

1337
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,400
I know.

1338
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,400
Oh, people get nauseous by me.

1339
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,400
Yeah.

1340
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,400
All right, babe.

1341
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,400
Stop.

1342
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,400
Thanks for coming on the show.

1343
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,400
Go out.

1344
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,400
Go play with your parents.

1345
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,400
Okay.

1346
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,400
I love you.

1347
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,400
I love you too.

1348
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,400
Bye, everybody.

1349

Oh, wait.

1350
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,400
Shit.

1351
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,400
I don't know if I don't do that.

1352
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,400
That's right.

1353
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,400
Bye.

1354
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,400
