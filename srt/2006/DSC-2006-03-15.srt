1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 3-5-3

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:20,000
For giving me pot father, for I have since saved

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Fantastic, it's Adam Curry.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You're looking for a better man.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
For want to make the sadness go away.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Taking everything you can.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Tears of falling sooner every day.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Waiting for your lucky break.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Laying on your bed for days.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
No it was your last mistake.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You keep on dreaming every day.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I want to know.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Do you feel this way?

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I want to know.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Are they all the same?

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I want to know if you can feel the pain.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Staring at your TV screen.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Knowing that the TV is your one and only friend.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But things are looking up.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
From down in the hole.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Things are looking up.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
They can't know us.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Things are looking up.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
From down in the hole.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Things are looking up.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
They can't know us.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They can't know us.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You're waiting for a better man.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Someone to make the sadness go away.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Doing everything you can.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The drinks are flowing sooner every day.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Now it was your last mistake.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Laying on your bed for days.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You're burning but you're never a break.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I still you keep on dreaming every day.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I want to know.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Do you feel this way?

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I want to know.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Are they all the same?

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I want to know if you can feel the pain.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Staring at your TV screen.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Knowing that the TV is your one and only friend.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But things are looking up.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
From down in the hole.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Things are looking up.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
They can't know us.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Things are looking up.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
From down in the hole.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Things are looking up.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
They can't know us.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
They can't know us.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
They can't know us.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
They can't know us.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Things are looking up.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
American heartbreak.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Michael Butler's band.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Michael Butler's band.

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Everybody, how are you doing?

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Coming to you from northern California.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It is bright and early.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's 10 minutes.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The time that I'm making this podcast.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But we're here in San Francisco.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And once again, my little commute went very successfully.

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Let me just say a couple things about American heartbreak.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
As I said, that's Michael Butler's band.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's brand new.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
They have a record coming out on April 18th.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And they're starting a tour next Wednesday on the 22nd March in Las Vegas.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And I believe they're actually.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I don't know if it's the whole tour of it's just this particular date.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But in Vegas, they're playing with the helicopters.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm told are pretty damn good.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So has Michael said here.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The song is things are looking up.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's no Matthew evil, but it's okay.

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's very, very, very much okay.

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Ah, yes. Well, let me tell you a little bit about the past 24 hours.

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Actually, it was really interesting.

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
For me to have recorded the show, the Daily Source code for Tuesday.

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Now, I recorded that Monday night, but it actually didn't go up until Tuesday morning.

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So I got on a plane. I flew like 9,000 miles.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It was a long flight this time was 10 hours and 26 minutes.

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Which was, you know, that's like a four movie, a four movie flight right there.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And then I arrived at the condo, say, I was in like 230 something like that.

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And then I flipped on serious.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And then I could hear the show.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I actually got here before the show got here.

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It was the weirdest thing because, of course, on a serious satellite,

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
we're on a star's 102 channel 102 now.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So we were, so you got Howard at 100 101 is the Howard News channel.

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And then 102 is where you can find us every week.

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
After noon, between three and seven Pacific six and ten Eastern time.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So it was, it was just, it was twisted, as weather was.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay, movies on the flight. Let's see.

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Good night and good luck.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Now, it was actually bad luck for this movie that it was the first thing I watched because, you know,

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I got, I left it, you know, 830 in the morning.

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We'd had a really long busy weekend. So I was pretty tired.

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And of course, they offer you that come when you got on the plane.

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's like, would you like champagne?

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Just like, I want champagne to live in the morning.

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Or do you want orange juice?

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Well, why don't you throw the two of them together.

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Some of us call that a mimosa in the UK.

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's called a boxfiz.

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So I was kind of loosen relax.

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I think I fell asleep five times during that movie.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I just couldn't get into it.

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
For some reason, it just didn't work for me.

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And I saw the movie with 50 cent, 50 cent.

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What is it to get rich or die?

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Get rich faster die or die trying something like that.

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Actually, pretty damn good movie.

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah, it was really, I think, really gave it pretty good look into the hip hop culture

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and where a lot of hip hop and rap artists come from.

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And got, I can't remember the third movie I watched.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm fuzzy.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And the reason I'm fuzzy is because after I got it, and by the way, the apartment,

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't know what happened to the cleaning crew,

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
but they went through this place like the white tornado.

125
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Unbelievable.

126
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They washed my bathrobe.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
My toilet paper was even folded in a nice little, you know,

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
pointy thing that you get in hotels.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The silverware.

130
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
As you know, when we ordered all that stuff for the condo,

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Patricia got 100, 100 knives, 100 forks,

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and hadn't even unpacked half of them.

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
They were still in their plastic sheets.

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Well, guess what?

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Every single one was unpacked and organized in the draw.

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
All the draws were reorganized.

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But it was fantastic.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I guess there's more women in my life now

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
that I don't even know about who we're doing a great job.

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I love it. I love it. I love it.

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So today we'll talk a little bit about pot-saving music network,

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
because we got to, we'll do that after the satellite window closes.

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
There's just some stuff that I wanted to catch up on.

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Oh yeah, so I went to the HQ after enjoying the lovely fresh apartment.

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You know, I figured you stop buying, say hi to everybody around 4 o'clock.

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And it was jam, you walk in, it was just one big,

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
bubbling, lukewarm,

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
peachy dish of creativity.

149
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You know, it could just feel it oozing all over the place.

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It was fantastic.

151
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You know, so I hung out and said hi to everybody, try to catch up.

152
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And then around 6 o'clock everyone went next door to 21st Amendment,

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
which is like a bar restaurant that is literally next door to a pot-show HQ.

154
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And so I thought I'd go hang out.

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And you know how when you're, when you're,

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I mean, after a transatlantic flight, you know,

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I was hungry, but not really hungry.

158
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You know, I still don't know where, you know,

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't know my ass from my elbow, basically, at this point.

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But then you think about having a martini with some olives,

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
you know, a gray goose, vodka martini, dirty olives.

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And it almost makes you feel hungry for some reason.

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
When you're hungry, you can feel like, yeah,

164
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
that old, that kind of filled me up a little bit.

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And as you know, I'm not a drinker at all.

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So I think I had, I'm sure I had two.

167
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Maybe I had three.

168
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Whoa, oh man, it made like a ton of bricks.

169
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I came back.

170
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Actually, I didn't come back.

171
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Richard Brewer, hey, brought me back.

172
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
He dropped me off and I came upstairs.

173
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And I unpacked the rest of my suitcase,

174
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
which meant I literally threw all the elements of the studio,

175
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
which I carry with me through them down on the bar here,

176
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and just went to bed.

177
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You know, I was asleep by nine o'clock.

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And just completely out.

179
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I couldn't walk straight.

180
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And I woke up.

181
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I didn't even set an alarm.

182
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You know, I woke up at, oh, was it?

183
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Four o'clock?

184
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah, four, 15 a.m.

185
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And even though my brain was completely awake,

186
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and I'm ready and rocking and rolling to go,

187
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
like, okay, I'll get up.

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And you know, I'll start prepping the show,

189
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
and going through just tons of email,

190
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
because when you travel for 10 hours,

191
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
you lose track of every email thread,

192
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
it's just so much incoming.

193
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And I was still, who see I was still like walking around.

194
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh, he's a,

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I gotta stay away from drink.

196
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It is not my poison.

197
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Let me tell you.

198
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So, on the show today,

199
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
some interesting feedback,

200
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and this first one,

201
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I definitely want to take a little bit of time

202
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
going through.

203
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's, it's from,

204
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
well, I'm not even going to tell you who is from.

205
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It was from Vasily.

206
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And I know Vasily.

207
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
In fact, he sent me this email,

208
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
said, do you remember your trip to Moscow in 1989?

209
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I do.

210
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I was there.

211
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
We met.

212
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We worked together.

213
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Now, it, of course,

214
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
you know, this doesn't immediately spark off all kinds of,

215
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
oh, yes.

216
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Of course, I remember Vasily.

217
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That was a very, very weird trip.

218
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
He says, I hope you find this bit of audio feedback entertaining.

219
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Is anything I can do for you?

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Let me know,

221
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
all the best to you and your family,

222
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
keep podcasting Vasily.

223
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Okay.

224
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So, let's, let's just go through this email.

225
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Let me just set the stage for you.

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
This is 1989.

227
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The Berlin Wall still firmly in place.

228
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Doc McGee, manager of Bon Jovi,

229
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Motley crew, Skid Row, and a couple others.

230
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He had been busted for, I think,

231
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
he had a plane, a private jet or something

232
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
that had been confiscated

233
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
because it had, I don't know,

234
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
a couple tons of weed on board

235
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
that they were flying into Miami.

236
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And anyways, a part of his get out of jail free.

237
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
He had to do a number of anti-alcohol anti-drug events.

238
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And so he put together this Moscow Music Peace Festival,

239
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
which was, of course, a great idea

240
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
to take a whole bunch of rock and rollers.

241
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Musicians, over to Lenin Stadium in Moscow

242
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and put on a show.

243
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And of course, MTV went along.

244
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The whole show was, and these were the days,

245
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I think Billy Joel had just been there two weeks before.

246
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So there was a lot of stuff happening

247
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
in the East Block and it was really an interesting time

248
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
for musicians from the West to come in.

249
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And so we actually took a plane from Newark.

250
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And see, on the plane in Newark,

251
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Ozzy was on there.

252
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You know, the Bon Jovis, Montley Crew, Skid Row.

253
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't remember everybody.

254
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Giza Butler was on, of course, with Ozzy

255
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
for a mini black Sabbath reunion.

256
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And it was just a regular chartered flight.

257
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
No first class, all kind of like an airbus,

258
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
like an easy jet idea.

259
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And then we first flew to Germany to pick up the scorpions

260
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and then from Germany went over to Russia.

261
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It was a pretty long flight.

262
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And I think I've talked about some of the things

263
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
that went on on the flight over there.

264
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Then we arrived in Moscow.

265
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And this was really the time when your passport

266
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
were confiscated upon entering the country.

267
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And it was really, it was kind of weird and intense.

268
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And then the hotel that we stayed in, in the middle of Moscow.

269
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You know, it was a luxury hotel,

270
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
but this is pretty rich, rich Russia.

271
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And the rest, excuse me, the rest, we really,

272
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
with the hell was that, oh, I guess I did set my alarm.

273
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What is that?

274
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What?

275
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Hold on.

276
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh.

277
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Don't go away.

278
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It'll never shut off if I don't do it.

279
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Hold on a second.

280
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Okay.

281
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So that's how the vodka Martinez worked.

282
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I don't even remember setting it alarm,

283
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
but it makes sense that I set it at 6 a.m.

284
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
to get going.

285
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
All right.

286
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Let's continue.

287
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So this hotel, which was the luxury hotel,

288
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
the mattresses were basically straw filled with straw.

289
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
There was warm water, but that was only because they turned on the warm water

290
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
in that particular section of the city just for us.

291
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And it was weird because, oh, God.

292
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
How many alarms are going to go off here?

293
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Stop this already.

294
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Jesus Christ.

295
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Interrupting the flow of my show.

296
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yes, yes, yes.

297
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Okay.

298
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I set two alarms.

299
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm telling you, I should not be drinking martinis.

300
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
All right, continuing.

301
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So you can imagine that this was a really, really weird vibe.

302
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And I'm going to play this audio comment.

303
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm going to interrupt it here and there to just give you some background.

304
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What's some of the things that Vasily is talking about.

305
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But now, of course, I do remember.

306
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And he remembers my trip a lot better than I do.

307
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Hello there, Adam.

308
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
This is Vasily Strunnikov in Moscow.

309
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You might remember me from your trip to Russia in 1989

310
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
when you and MTV were here for the big music and peace festival

311
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
at Lenin Stadium with Bomb Jovis Cinderella's Skid Row and others.

312
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I was your Russian-American translator.

313
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Baby sitter.

314
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Now, that's when I remembered.

315
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh, yeah, I do remember we had a guy with spoke excellent English.

316
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And the English he's speaking now is even better than I recall it.

317
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And he was our guide.

318
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Of course, there was no MTV Russia at the time,

319
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
but we'll get into that in a second.

320
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Remember all the vodka and the late night parties at Gorky Park?

321
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yes, not just Gorky Park, but I think we went to the red square as well.

322
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Now, you have to understand.

323
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
This was an anti-drug and anti alcohol concert.

324
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And Vasily was completely trashed on the plane before we even,

325
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
you know, were out of the outside of US airspace.

326
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I think I've told you that story where he was standing in the,

327
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
standing in the aisle next to the laboratory,

328
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
which someone was, you know, was occupied.

329
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And he's just standing like,

330
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Sherrad.

331
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Sherrad.

332
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I got it.

333
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I got it.

334
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Sherrad.

335
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And he didn't help.

336
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And he just wet himself right there.

337
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It was the most embarrassing thing.

338
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Not just for him.

339
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We were all embarrassed for him.

340
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Okay.

341
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So, yeah, lots, I remember lots of vodka,

342
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Comrade.

343
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I certainly, isn't that a coincidence that I had all the vodka last night

344
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
and we're talking about vodka again this morning?

345
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
A big boat with a KGB hookers.

346
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
There indeed, I don't know if it's still there,

347
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
but there was a boat.

348
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And this boat was basically a horror house.

349
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And there was also a bar and any Westerner could go,

350
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
could go to this boat.

351
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And you walk a gangplank.

352
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Oh, man, I'm starting to remember this now, gosh.

353
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And there are all these little births and bunks and little doors.

354
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And maybe 20 or something like that.

355
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It was a reasonably sized boat or barge or whatever.

356
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And they were all hookers.

357
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But of course, they were all KGB hookers.

358
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And at least that's what we were told.

359
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's like, whatever you do, man, you do not want to have sex

360
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
with any of the hookers over there because they're all affiliated with the KGB.

361
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And what they'll do is they'll blackmail you.

362
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And then before you know it, you're going to be an agent.

363
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You'll have to be spying on your own country because they'll blacken out.

364
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's like, whoa.

365
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And by the way, let me just say,

366
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
not that I would do anything like that anyway.

367
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But there was nothing there for me, my friends.

368
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Nothing.

369
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Or the time Kurt Loader got so loaded that we almost blocked him

370
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
at Red Square.

371
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
In fact, he's sin along a picture,

372
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
which I'm going to post along with opposite on curry dot com

373
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
along with the show notes.

374
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
He has a picture of Kurt Loader completely hammered on a chair

375
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
with some woman hanging over him.

376
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I don't remember who she was.

377
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But yes, I do remember we lot.

378
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
We couldn't find Kurt.

379
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
He was gone.

380
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It was gone for hours.

381
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
This is one of our like three a.m.

382
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Hey, let's, it's a great idea.

383
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Let's go drink some vodka on Red Square.

384
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah, that'll be fun.

385
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Which, of course, it was.

386
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And at that time, oh my God,

387
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
the Moscow Hell's Angel showed up.

388
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Completely outlawed group of guys,

389
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
you know, driving Java motorcycles and popping off,

390
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
popping wheelies and flipping off the back.

391
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And very, very intense scene.

392
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
So yes, I remember that particularly Kurt getting so loaded

393
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and we lost him.

394
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Picture will be on curry dot com.

395
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Check it out in the show notes for today.

396
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The stories, the memories.

397
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You know what's interesting?

398
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You and I have quite a few things in common.

399
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Like you, I spent my childhood in Maryland.

400
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I've been in broadcasting for over 25 years.

401
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I am a former MTV VJ.

402
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
MTV Russia, that is.

403
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And like you,

404
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I advocate and support podcasting.

405
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
In my case, Russian podcasting.

406
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
About a year ago, while listening to your show,

407
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I thought, why not start podcasting in Russia?

408
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So we launched Russia's first and only podcast directory site

409
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
at Russianpodcasting.ru.

410
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Now, the local press are having a field day with this.

411
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
They can't get enough of the fact that there is something

412
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,000
strange about XMTVVJs that makes them engage in such activities as podcasting.

413
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
They mention you and their articles all the time, Adam.

414
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Anyway, we're celebrating our first anniversary with a big conference,

415
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
and a big shout out to all Russians around the world,

416
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
listening to your show to check us out at Russianpodcasting.ru.

417
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And speaking of Russians around the world,

418
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,000
remember the time in 1989 when you were bored in the production office at Lenin Stadium?

419
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You know, there was a lot of boredom during that week we were there.

420
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'll tell you that.

421
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So yeah, I remember some of it.

422
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And you grabbed a polaroid camera and started taking pictures of yourself.

423
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Well, another famous Russian in the international podcast community,

424
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Marc Yoshimoto Nemtsoff has my exclusive on that story.

425
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
But if you play this bit of feedback, I'm willing to renegotiate.

426
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Hold on a second, you think a comma, commie dickhead?

427
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
What do you blackmailing me now?

428
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Like, you're some KGB hooker on a barge?

429
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm not afraid, man.

430
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Actually, when I heard this, you heard this audio comment.

431
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And then it got to this point, I'm like, oh, man, you know, the voice, everything.

432
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's a joke.

433
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's a specific host to Hellway joke.

434
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
But it isn't because this guy is for real.

435
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Vasily is for real.

436
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Russian podcasting.ru is for real.

437
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
The Kurt Loder picture I put up is for real.

438
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
The stories are for real.

439
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And we should really do a Skype conference because I've been feeling that Vasily will remember

440
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
a hell of a lot more than I did, but maybe when he recalls some of the things that

441
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
that happened during that trip, I might be able to chime in.

442
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
But, you know, man, don't go blackmailing me.

443
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Just some of the damn pictures I'll post him.

444
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
There's nothing I can be here for.

445
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm ashamed of absolutely not.

446
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Come on, man.

447
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And I played your thing anyway.

448
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Thanks for all good luck and dolls.

449
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Vidanya.

450
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Don't come red curry.

451
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Rosridania.

452
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Hey, there you go.

453
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Come red curry.

454
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That's a good one.

455
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's come red curry in the curry condo.

456
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Coming to you from Northern California.

457
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And it's actually looking outside.

458
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I think it's going to be, um, looks like it's going to be overcast.

459
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
There's no sun coming up yet.

460
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Man, there's so many people going to work at this time in the morning.

461
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
There's already a traffic jam almost coming off of the Bay Bridge.

462
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And I noticed that the Coca-Cola sign is broken.

463
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It just says enjoy, which is kind of nice.

464
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The Coca-Cola piece never appears.

465
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It just says enjoy.

466
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And it stays there all night.

467
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
All right, Vasily.

468
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Very cool, man.

469
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Good to hear from you.

470
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I really appreciate the Kurt Loder pick.

471
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And I appreciate you reminding me of some of the things that some of the things that

472
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
the took place during that infamous trip for the Moscow Music Peace Festival, which I guess

473
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
the whole concert was, uh, was recorded.

474
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I remember MTV aired.

475
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I don't know if they still have it or if they'll ever aired again, but it was,

476
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
it was definitely good times, my friend.

477
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Good times.

478
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And, uh, well, kind of staying over in that region of the world, way

479
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Yantan, send me an email.

480
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Adam, hope that podcasting will kick off in China.

481
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
My thoughts are that it will.

482
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But as soon as a comment is made about the country values,

483
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
perhaps communist or otherwise, the government or the internet police.

484
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Hmm, I didn't know they had actual internet police, but wouldn't put it past them.

485
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
They will ban it.

486
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We are talking about a country that changed the title of Despert Housewives to Crazy Housewives

487
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and censored all the sex scenes because they thought it was too promiscuous.

488
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Oh, that's interesting.

489
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
If you take out all the sex scenes out of Despert Housewives, what's left of the show?

490
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I wonder how Pacifico's hellway or East Radio will even get to air in China.

491
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I would really love to hear what you have to say about that at a future daily source code way.

492
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Yeah.

493
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Thank you very much, way.

494
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Well, it's going to be interesting, you know.

495
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I think, I guess that you're in China.

496
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So you obviously know about Pacifico's hellway and East Radio.

497
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I think that, you know, that's one thing.

498
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And what's probably much more interesting and exciting is to see what the Chinese are going to do with podcasting.

499
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And what are they going to be sending our way?

500
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I think that's the stuff that is exciting and interesting.

501
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
There's enough ways for the Chinese to understand what's going on in the culture in the West,

502
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
but for us to understand what's going on there is a completely different story.

503
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And with all the millions and millions of portable devices and cell phones,

504
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I think that we're going to be able to learn quite a lot about podcasting from portable devices.

505
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And we certainly hope to reach our 100 million mini screens in China as we're going for 100 million listeners here.

506
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
In the US and in Europe.

507
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And actually today, I have a meeting.

508
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's going to be a good meeting with British telecom.

509
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Out here, all their marketing mucks are here for some conference or something.

510
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And they've asked Ron and I to come over and talk about podcasting.

511
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Could this finally be the kick in the pants that the United Kingdom needs to really get it all cranking?

512
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I think it's very possible.

513
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
These guys definitely have a hold on a lot of the broadband market.

514
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And I think determined a lot of what is taking place in the UK as it pertains to alternate forms of media.

515
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And now the BBC is getting very, very close to releasing a lot of shows as podcasts.

516
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
In fact, people send me a couple of links to shows that haven't been publicized yet,

517
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
but our podcast, there's a daily news podcast that I like a lot,

518
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
that's kind of a collection of all the BBC radio news shows.

519
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And it's about, you know, 15, 20 minutes perfect to catch up on.

520
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
If you just want to know what's happening in the world of, of onty of the BBC.

521
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
But they still don't actually talk a lot about podcasts and they talk about web casting or alternative radio.

522
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And so, you know, there could be something going on there.

523
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Those of you listening to a serious channel 102.

524
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
This is the daily source code part of the pod show line up.

525
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Up next, we will have Pacific Coastel way.

526
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Followed by yeast radio and Dawn and Drew.

527
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
We'll take you up until 10 o'clock eastern time, 7 Pacific.

528
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And I'll see you back here tomorrow.

529
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Bye-bye.

530
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And for those of you still hanging out on the podcast, let's continue, shall we?

531
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I've got a few things that I wanted to catch up on.

532
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I just didn't feel right about, you know, dropping the topics of,

533
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
let's see, internet surcharges.

534
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It's one thing that we've been talking about.

535
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I've got so many different pieces of feedback.

536
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
So many people, you know, weighing in on what this means and how it's going to work.

537
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And it seems to be actually still quite confusing.

538
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Here's a comment about it.

539
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Let's see what this is.

540
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Hello.

541
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Hello.

542
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
How many are you so soft?

543
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
It's a Charlie 340 last night and heard the comments by the listener.

544
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Pretending to tear your internet, the stemmed from your discussion of DSC.

545
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
AT&T's proposed acquisition of Bell South.

546
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
There seems to be a lot of misconceptions running around the internet,

547
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
especially in the podcasting community of what the R box true intentions are.

548
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Unfortunately, they do not articulate those intentions very well.

549
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Their management, they're well, their dinosaurs, frankly.

550
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And they're not very good at communicating with their customers,

551
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
the public.

552
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Unfortunately, that's not their fault so much as a problem that exists in the,

553
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
in the environment they've been brought up in as they've risen through the ranks.

554
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
What they're really talking about here is a differentiated service,

555
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
not shutting off any or blocking any potential services of people that don't pay the ransom

556
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
or giving any crummy services because you don't pay this so called ransom,

557
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
but providing a better quality service for those people that want to provide

558
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
a specific time-sensitive services.

559
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm just going to stop this right here, hold on a second.

560
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm going to reconfigure everything, oh man.

561
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I don't buy it at all.

562
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You know, what's happening is it's happening all over the media landscape

563
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
and telecommunications landscape.

564
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
We've known for years and years that all the things the telephone line does

565
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
can be done through IP through internet protocol traffic.

566
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
This is what we're seeing with all these voiceover IP services.

567
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I literally think that we're at this point now where voiceover IP and people

568
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
using Skype or Vonage or what have you is really hurting the telecos business.

569
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
They're seeing all this money they're pouring into backbones.

570
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
They're seeing basically that they're not a part of the content piece.

571
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
This is what's happening.

572
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Now whether I'm making a phone call to you over the internet,

573
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
or whether I'm making a podcast, or whether whatever it is,

574
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
they understand unlike the Dutch court system.

575
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
They understand that that content has a much higher value than the roads that it

576
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
travels over.

577
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And they want a piece of it.

578
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
That's basically it.

579
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
They're looking at Google saying, oh shit.

580
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You know, these guys are making money.

581
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Thanks to our pipes.

582
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Yeah, we'll not just your pipes.

583
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Thanks to a whole bunch of people's pipes.

584
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And now that I'm investigating this situation more,

585
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
it's going to be very hard for them to do any of this,

586
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
this metering or this prioritizing of packets.

587
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And less everyone is full, I think.

588
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And this is just a layman speaking here.

589
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And less everyone is fully, what is it?

590
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
IPv6 compatible.

591
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So version 6 of the internet protocol.

592
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And so maybe it's just a lot of talk.

593
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Maybe they'll try to do it through legislation.

594
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But whatever happens, it is definitely in my mind,

595
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
not the way to make this, to make this all.

596
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I'd rather pay more money just for my monthly bandwidth bill

597
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
than have, you know, services being taxed.

598
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And maybe services that I'll never get to because, well, low and behold,

599
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
a small company or a bunch of entrepreneurs who just want to get something

600
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
going can't actually afford to do it anymore,

601
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
which is not the spirit of the internet at all.

602
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And not the spirit of all these tools we've been building to make it

603
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
very cheap and easy.

604
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You know, these are people trying to build walled gardens.

605
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Same goes for the email tax.

606
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Let's just call it a tax.

607
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I mean, but it's not a government tax.

608
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
It's like airport tax.

609
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
In fact, airport.

610
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It's very like airport tax.

611
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You know what you go somewhere.

612
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And you know, you, the tickets, let's just say,

613
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
to take it costs 100 bucks and then your hotel costs 100 bucks.

614
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
At the end of the day, you wind up paying 300 bucks for the vacation.

615
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And they say, well, you know, it's all these airport taxes.

616
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Well, airport tax is basically a landing fee.

617
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It's what the airport, the airport charges the carrier to take you there.

618
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It's not, when they say tax, you immediately think,

619
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
well, that means it's a government thing and it was nothing we can do about it.

620
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Bullshit.

621
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It's just money that is the cost of doing business for an airline.

622
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And it's been, it's very much like these ISPs and email.

623
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
If you want your email delivered, then you're going to have to start paying a tax in

624
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
future.

625
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Check this out.

626
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
You know, it's not just, oh, there's a whole bunch of shenanigans going on

627
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
with email between large email service providers.

628
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Let's call on that.

629
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
So if you have a hot mail account, you're pretty much screwed on all

630
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
things because you're, you're not getting a lot of mail.

631
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And of course, interestingly enough, hot mail delivers the most spam to you,

632
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
than any other, any other email service.

633
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Chris says, I don't have an Apple dot Mac account.

634
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And I cannot email people at Yahoo.

635
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
My email never shows up in Yahoo mailbox as when sending it from my dot

636
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Mac account to large companies.

637
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And they can't figure this out.

638
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Come on, not to mention I pay $99 for my email service.

639
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Well, that is, of course, an outrage.

640
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And of course, it's all, I think it's illegal to stuff that's going on.

641
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
This is illegal.

642
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So we have our email stuff set in place.

643
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It'll be up and rolling next week sometime.

644
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
You know, we've got the, the way we got the strong mail service.

645
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So you get like boxes, you know, hardware and software and then the service.

646
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And apparently now we should have, I mean, even castblaster dot com is getting

647
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
crap now in registration emails.

648
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It's just, it's a freaking outrage.

649
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
So even though this is one I'd like to fight, we also have a business to run.

650
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
So I guess all I can do is keep talking about this horrible precedent that's being set

651
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
as companies now charging for delivery of email.

652
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And you should just not stand for it.

653
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,000
You know, if you're paying for email and you're paying for sending email or receiving email,

654
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
you know, you should be receiving email.

655
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And you should be sending email.

656
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
It should be working.

657
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And they should put the owners on your, on your ISP.

658
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
You'll see.

659
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You'll see before too long, you're going to notice that some of your emails aren't showing up.

660
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Excuse me.

661
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I get so excited about this stuff.

662
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So we're just keeping our eye on it.

663
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I think there's a project called Goodmail.

664
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I think it's goodmail.

665
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I'll have to look into it.

666
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
But, you know, the end of the day, all these individual ISPs.

667
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:28,000
So if you leave, you have your email through Yahoo or Hotmail or MSN or Gmail or Apple.

668
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
However, you get your email, Comcast, perhaps.

669
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
They are the ones that are supposed to deliver the email to you.

670
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And they're basically not.

671
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Sure.

672
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
They're saying it's for spam.

673
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
But, you know, to some people, spam is desired.

674
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And maybe that's something you still want to handle on the client end,

675
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
actually when the email comes down to you.

676
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
You have to be in continuous conversation about this stuff.

677
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Because without a doubt, I'd say most of it is wrong.

678
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Ah.

679
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Yes.

680
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Of course.

681
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
The network continues to grow.

682
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I'd love this, too.

683
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Unfortunately, it's not a happy mood, doesn't it?

684
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Hello.

685
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Coming to you from the Pod Show Network.

686
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It's the all-creator show with your hosts.

687
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Everyone's favorite, that Nurian, Dr. Lee, Quarbridge,

688
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
and I'm his wife, Robin.

689
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
When you see an alligator in the wild in Florida, go the other way.

690
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Yeah, this is not a bad thing.

691
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It's time for animal stuff where you have fun and learn something too.

692
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Animal sound of the week.

693
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Can you guess what it is?

694
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
This is the breed of the week section.

695
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
That was it.

696
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Uh-oh, uh-oh, pick me, pick me, pick me.

697
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Yeah.

698
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It would be really cool.

699
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
It's animal trivia time.

700
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
This is the part where you get to see how much you really know.

701
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
All critters were talking Robin.

702
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Everything animals from medical conditions to just chat.

703
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
We covered all.

704
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Have fun and learn something too.

705
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Find us at all critters.pot show.com.

706
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Hi, Adam. This is Doc.

707
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Hi, and this is Robin.

708
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And we just wanted to say thank you for inviting us to join the Pod Show Network.

709
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
We're extremely excited to be a part of the Quit Your Day Job Group.

710
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
We feel honored that you chose us,

711
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
and we just wanted you to know that we appreciate it.

712
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
We're looking forward to our long journey together.

713
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Pod Show Rocks.

714
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It was still in the pinch me stage that we're a part of it.

715
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
We also wanted to say that we love the daily source code,

716
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
and we're totally addicted to it.

717
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Keep up the great work.

718
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Thanks again for having all critters on the Pod Show Network.

719
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And thanks for playing our promo.

720
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Hey, I wonder if Adam is trying to guess what animal sound that was.

721
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Should we tell him?

722
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Nah, let's keep everyone guessing.

723
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Then we'll have to listen to the show.

724
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Animal sounds are so cool.

725
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
To go line that with the animal trivia,

726
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
a medical conditions we cover.

727
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
We just wanted everyone to have fun and learn something too.

728
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
How critters experience it at all critters.podshow.com?

729
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I think it was a go for.

730
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I'm pretty sure of it.

731
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Hey, some interesting stuff going on in France.

732
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
France is considering a law that gives consumers the right

733
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
to break digital rights management.

734
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Better known as DRM.

735
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Just going to pull up the story here.

736
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
A couple people emailed this to me.

737
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I just want to tell you what the deal is.

738
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
This is pop up from silicon.com.

739
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And here we go.

740
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
A law currently making its way through French Parliament

741
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
could see Apple's fair play DRM opened up.

742
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Now, this is the way that Apple protects all the songs

743
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
that you purchase from iTunes and use on your iPod.

744
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Change it to the French Dwatt Delta copyright law.

745
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Currently being debated in Parliament

746
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
are expected to be voted on this week.

747
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Among the changes, the controversial legislation

748
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
will bring in will be measures to effectively dismantle all types

749
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
of digital rights management, including the technology

750
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
that prevent content from Apple's music stores being played

751
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
on Microsoft devices and vice versa.

752
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Check this out.

753
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
The law will enshrine the right to interoperability

754
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
between content and devices.

755
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Which, of course, is really a great idea.

756
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Effectively allowing consumers to break

757
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
or otherwise circumvent DRM and play music

758
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
on the MP3 player of their choice.

759
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
This is really exciting stuff.

760
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
In a recent parliamentary debate, Dominic Rishard

761
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
a diputee from the UNP coalition described the law

762
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
as instituting interoperability

763
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
that will stop content being the hostage of technology

764
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
and authorized creativity using free as in speech software.

765
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
The law will also overhaul the country's legal system

766
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
with regard to music piracy giving those convicted

767
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
of downloading-pired music a fixed 38-year-old fine

768
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
and those convicted of illegally making music available

769
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
for download a 150-year-old fine,

770
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
which I think is probably much more in line

771
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
with the value of what is being stolen

772
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
if someone steals music basically.

773
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
So I think what's happening here is what they're saying

774
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
is you would be allowed to reencode

775
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
something you bought off of iTunes for your iPod

776
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
into another open format if it's for personal use.

777
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And of course this is very exciting.

778
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Who knows, what a thunket man coming from the French.

779
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I think this is great.

780
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So let's keep our eye on that one

781
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
because it's definitely definitely something cool

782
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
going on in France when it comes to licensing

783
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
and digital rights management.

784
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And if you can break it there,

785
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
well, I guess you can break it to anywhere, can't you?

786
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Hey, I'm as Jay Mac from producer and webmaster slash

787
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
whatever of the hoody.com show

788
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
calling you from warm Detroit.

789
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I wanted to call and say thank you very, very much

790
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
for your continued support of the hoody.com show

791
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
and our movement, everything we do

792
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
and I really, really appreciate that.

793
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And it's always good to hear that you're actually

794
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
listening to the show.

795
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I thank you for that.

796
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So I'm also leaving this voice message

797
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
to ask you about pardon me in driving and kind of out there.

798
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I wanted to ask you about licensing with ASK at BMI.

799
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And I said you an email, but I don't expect to reply.

800
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
So I'm hoping this voice message will be even better.

801
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So here's my question.

802
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
We interview obviously some good artists,

803
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
some big artists in the industry of hip-hop.

804
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And it's getting better.

805
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I mean, like coming up we have, you know,

806
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
boss derirons was coming up in April and, you know,

807
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
we're going to be interviewing TI and people like that.

808
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Some pretty big names, so I mean,

809
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
but the problem with it is is that a lot of these artists,

810
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
they don't really want to do the interview unless

811
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
you're going to be playing their music.

812
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
That's the whole reason they're doing the interview

813
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
is for publicity.

814
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
So here's, you know, obviously here's my issue.

815
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
We want to be able to play some of their music

816
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
and we don't want to necessarily play the entire track.

817
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I mean, we're cool with just playing

818
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
their instrumental behind the interview

819
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
and then maybe playing a 10 or 15 or 20 second clip

820
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
of their track after or during the interview as well,

821
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
like of one of their singles or biggest single or something like that.

822
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
So, I mean, my question is, you know,

823
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
do you necessarily need a ASK at BMI license just to do that?

824
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I mean, because it doesn't seem necessary

825
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
if you're not playing the whole song.

826
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
If the whole song can't be taken,

827
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
then why should you get to pay a licensing fee?

828
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
We're helping them promote their music.

829
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
You know, I mean, it's a trade, you know,

830
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
it's a hit-for-tat type of thing.

831
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So, I'm really curious to hear if there's a way around that.

832
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It's really frustrating.

833
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I mean, I actually talked to somebody over at ASKAP

834
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
and the second I said podcast or internet,

835
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
they started getting skittish.

836
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
They started weirding out and they don't want to talk about it

837
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
and you need licensing.

838
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
You got a license.

839
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
You got a white license.

840
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Internet license or whatever the fuck they call it.

841
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You got to have internet license.

842
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
You got to have it.

843
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
You got to have it.

844
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
You know, I read about it.

845
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
It's like $300 a year.

846
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And then there's like a per-download fee,

847
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
which is bullshit to me.

848
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So, there's got to be a way.

849
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I will provide and read and you'll know the way

850
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
is to get the actual person who holds the master's

851
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
like the label or the artist to sign off.

852
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I'm letting us play their track.

853
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You know, which is like, come on.

854
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I mean, in the mainstream industry, there's no record label

855
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
that's going to sign, you know,

856
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
some sort of contract like that.

857
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
There's no way.

858
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
You know, they're going to want to get the ASKAP

859
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
BMI fees.

860
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
You know, if there's any to be had.

861
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So, I'm hoping if there's anybody out there

862
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
or if you know the answer to this,

863
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I'd really appreciate it.

864
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And I'm hoping it works in our favor

865
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
because we really, really, really don't want to get

866
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
a license through ASKAP to do this shit.

867
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
We'd really like to handle this without paying that money.

868
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I mean, it's, we figured it's a fair trade

869
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
if we're promoting the artist.

870
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
We're getting, you know, we get to play a clip of their song

871
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
and play their voice on the show.

872
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I mean, it's to trade off.

873
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I don't know.

874
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Okay. So, he continues on a little bit

875
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
and leaves his cell phone numbers.

876
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So, I won't play that.

877
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
You know, this is a question that I get asked a lot.

878
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And I'm not a lawyer, of course,

879
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
but the official answer is yes.

880
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I mean, you need to have a license

881
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
to be able to use any type of license music

882
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
through the RIA or otherwise

883
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
or if it's licensed through ASKAP BMI.

884
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
You have to have a license for the performance,

885
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
which means you're basically using that

886
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
as a part of your podcast.

887
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
And then just to cover all the bases

888
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
because record companies, I think the lawyers

889
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
are the record companies pretty much

890
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
feel that, you know, this is a mechanical distribution

891
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
because you're actually downloading something

892
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
and it's going on to a disc of some sort

893
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
so that the royalty has to be paid for that as well.

894
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
So, you're right.

895
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
And the fees just don't make sense

896
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
because, you know, I was even looking at the UK,

897
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
MCPS, NPCS, PRS, whatever the combined license

898
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
we talked about the other day.

899
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And even though the licensing is now starting

900
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
to get worked out, you know,

901
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
and of course, that's to pay 12% of my gross profit.

902
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Yeah, do I got a blow job with that?

903
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
You know, you start looking at it

904
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
and then all those strictions

905
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
and the money it's going to cost you to think,

906
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
oh, why won't I do it?

907
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Why won't I even promote that industry?

908
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Now, of course, for hood hype,

909
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
you know, it is great to talk to people

910
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
like Buster Rimes and, you know,

911
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
and they're always working with lots of independent talent.

912
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
And I think in reality,

913
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
if you interview them and you use 10,

914
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
15 seconds of a track, you know, behind him,

915
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I don't think anyone's going to sue you,

916
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
but they could, you know,

917
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
so you're definitely taking a risk

918
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and again, I will say to the record industry again.

919
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
This is the stupidest way

920
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
to try and license your music.

921
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
It's not going to get you any value

922
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
because very few podcasts are kind of for it

923
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
and the ones that can,

924
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I think most of them that can.

925
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I mean, I'd much rather promote

926
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Michael Butler, Matthew Ebel,

927
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
a lower clap or brother love.

928
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
You know, these are, these are people

929
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
who do appreciate it,

930
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
and are trying to charge me

931
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
for the privilege of playing their music.

932
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
You know, it's true that.

933
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
What you should do is have a special button in iTunes

934
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
or wherever you want to make your music available

935
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
for download.

936
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And if someone is going to download it

937
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
for use on a podcast,

938
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
charge them five bucks.

939
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You know, it's a one shot deal.

940
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
There's plenty of songs.

941
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I would just love to play.

942
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
And I bet you I would play a five dollar song

943
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
every single day.

944
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So what would that be?

945
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
150 bucks.

946
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
You're talking almost,

947
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
probably around $2,000 a year,

948
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
you would make for my show.

949
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
You know,

950
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
let's talk about the hit test,

951
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
which I would love to bring back.

952
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I'll pay for three.

953
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
So I'll pay 15 bucks for a hit test

954
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
to be able to put a hit test together.

955
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
You're not, of course, I will.

956
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
That's the way to do it.

957
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I'm not going to give you 12% of the gross revenue

958
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
of my show for that privilege

959
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
for playing your back catalog.

960
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
So, and by the way, musicians,

961
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
you're the ones that should be revolting

962
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
against this stupid behavior

963
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
of your record companies,

964
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
stupid, it's just stupid.

965
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Okay, a couple more pots

966
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
of music network things,

967
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
just as I said,

968
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
to catch up on where we are

969
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
and some of the conversations

970
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
because by probably by this time next week,

971
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
we'll have our email registrations working fully

972
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
with the strong mail.

973
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
So that means we'll be able to open up

974
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
full sales across the network.

975
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Had some great conversations about this last night,

976
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I was sitting with Chris Rockwell,

977
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Sue, Kevin, Matt Oliver, Richard Brueher,

978
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
and we were really just shooting the shit

979
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
about all kinds of stuff and feeling

980
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
just feeling the love.

981
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And the fact that we're going to be integrating

982
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
a lot of the Podsate Music Network

983
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
into the whole, you know, Pod Show Plus

984
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
or Pod Show PDN.

985
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So what all kind of have a very consistent look

986
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
and feel everything all flow into each other

987
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
and, of course, Andrew Grumman is working on

988
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
API so that any other service

989
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
will be able to integrate the Podsate Music Network

990
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
into their service as well.

991
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
But I believe that,

992
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
well, we were talking about

993
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
actually opening up

994
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
both the podcasting and listening side

995
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
of Pod Show, the network,

996
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
sometime next week.

997
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And I think we're ready.

998
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Now, of course, it'll be super beta

999
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
because shit's just going to break

1000
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
and shit does happen.

1001
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
But I also think we'll be able to,

1002
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
show real fast growth every single, you know,

1003
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
day almost after that adding new features

1004
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
because we've just gotten to the point

1005
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
where we're so far ahead with all the features

1006
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
and things we want in there

1007
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
that if you look back to what our goals

1008
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
were for release,

1009
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I think we're there.

1010
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I really do.

1011
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
And it's funny, you know,

1012
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Ron and I were kind of like,

1013
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
looking at the development team looking

1014
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
for a signal from them to say,

1015
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
okay, we're ready to release

1016
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and I think they were waiting

1017
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
from a signal for us.

1018
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And somehow I felt that

1019
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
and that's what, that's what three

1020
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
vodka martinis will do for you.

1021
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Really brings you closer down to reality

1022
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
as what has to be done.

1023
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So maybe Wednesday, maybe Wednesday.

1024
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
And this means that all kinds of shit

1025
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
is going to be funky.

1026
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It's going to be broken all over the map.

1027
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
But this is kind of how it works.

1028
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
You know, this is the way

1029
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
development is done these days.

1030
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
You get something out there

1031
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
and just keep improving it.

1032
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
We'll keep the conversation going.

1033
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
We'll do a lot of it through

1034
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
the daily source code and other pod show

1035
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
podcasts to get feedback.

1036
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Already I've gotten several emails

1037
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
and people saying, hey,

1038
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
what's up with the funky URLs?

1039
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Turn it back to the original way you used to do it.

1040
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
No, I can't do that right now.

1041
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
We're working on all of these aspects.

1042
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Everything is, you know,

1043
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
if we're trying to get it all

1044
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
come together simultaneously.

1045
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
We've got a huge promotion

1046
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
starting up a network wide

1047
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
with the single sponsor

1048
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
that'll also and every single show

1049
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
that wants to is going to be involved in it.

1050
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
There's just a lot of goodness on the way.

1051
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
And as I said, a whole bunch of great improvements

1052
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
for the pod sake music network.

1053
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Adam, it's Russell from the Dark Matters podcast here.

1054
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Also from Brisbane Australia.

1055
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So that's at least two of us here.

1056
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
So I think you're also a trip

1057
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
when you come down under.

1058
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
All right, mate.

1059
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
You know, I see you like my recommendation

1060
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
of Bob Ferry for DSC339

1061
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
and we must have similar tastes in music

1062
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
because I put out episode three

1063
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
of Dark Matters yesterday

1064
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
and I want to be held when I listen to

1065
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
DSC this morning.

1066
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
You had the same song

1067
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Do the heavy mouth in heaven

1068
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
on episode three

1069
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
for eight of the Charlie.

1070
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
You know, and that is really coincidence.

1071
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I mean, I listen to, as you know,

1072
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
tons of podcasts and that's where I got

1073
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
a lot of inspiration,

1074
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
which of course is the whole point of the unlabel.

1075
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
You know, there is no central spot.

1076
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
So in this case,

1077
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I didn't hear your show

1078
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
and I wasn't influenced by it,

1079
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
but I would probably

1080
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
was influenced by some other show.

1081
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And that's how it works.

1082
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
You know, I'm continuously amazed

1083
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
at how many plays

1084
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
some songs are getting on the PMN.

1085
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I mean, it's in the thousands.

1086
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
It's just, it's fantastic.

1087
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
You know, I thought I'd just ring up

1088
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
and let you know,

1089
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I finally got around to trying out

1090
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
the click and buy purchase of

1091
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Putsay for Peace.

1092
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So I've been in Australian

1093
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
credit card holder.

1094
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I went through the click and buy process

1095
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
and because of the first time

1096
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
when I somehow missed putting

1097
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Australia in the country,

1098
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
which really mucked me up,

1099
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I went back and tried again

1100
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
and when I got the details right,

1101
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
everything went through sweet.

1102
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
So I never have

1103
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
my own purchased copy of

1104
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Putsay for Peace

1105
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
and Australian people

1106
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
can use it successfully

1107
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
apparently.

1108
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I don't know if they've improved

1109
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
since the last listeners tried.

1110
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
That seems to be up and going there.

1111
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Just though you might like to know

1112
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
and if any of you listeners

1113
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
would like to visit my podcast,

1114
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
you can find it at

1115
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Astronomy.podcastfilmet.com

1116
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
and until next time,

1117
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
thanks guys.

1118
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
What kind of skies?

1119
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Dark skies.

1120
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
That didn't say dark skies.

1121
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Yep.

1122
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
So just want to let you know

1123
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
that it is working in Australia.

1124
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
But again,

1125
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I think it does depend on

1126
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
the type of credit card or something

1127
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
that have been some

1128
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
funky results for some folks around the world.

1129
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Oh, you know,

1130
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I wasn't that hammer to remember

1131
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
last night.

1132
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Chris Rockwell was doing

1133
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
some of the math with me.

1134
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
And he says,

1135
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
So what if podshow

1136
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
would only make about

1137
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
four or five cents per song

1138
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
that was sold through the podset

1139
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
music network?

1140
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
He says,

1141
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
that doesn't seem like

1142
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
it's really worth it

1143
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
and maybe we shouldn't even take

1144
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
that money at all.

1145
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Of course,

1146
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
which I said is,

1147
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
oh great.

1148
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
So how about if we,

1149
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
if every song sold,

1150
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
we deduct four cents

1151
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
from your salary?

1152
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And you know what?

1153
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
He said,

1154
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
yeah, no problem.

1155
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I'll do it immediately.

1156
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And so that caught my attention

1157
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
because I was just being

1158
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
facetious.

1159
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
But if you do the math

1160
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
and you think about

1161
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
if we were to sell

1162
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
a million songs in a year,

1163
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
which I think would be quite

1164
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
a lot.

1165
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
That would be what?

1166
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
$40,000.

1167
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Because there's also taxes

1168
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
that go into the purchase price

1169
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
and we want podcasters

1170
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
to be able to.

1171
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
They don't have to.

1172
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
They can donate it back to the band

1173
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
or wherever they want

1174
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
to be able to take

1175
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
an affiliate fee.

1176
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
And the more,

1177
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
the more I think about it,

1178
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
the more I think that he may be right.

1179
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
You know,

1180
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
maybe just having people

1181
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
sign up to the network

1182
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
is enough value

1183
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
for podshow.

1184
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
It's definitely something

1185
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I'm going to discuss today

1186
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
at the office.

1187
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And I do want to leave all

1188
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
options open.

1189
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
But you know, as we said,

1190
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
certainly during the whole

1191
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
date of period,

1192
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
which will be months,

1193
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
we're not taking a dime

1194
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
from any of this.

1195
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
We're just going to have

1196
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
the click and buy

1197
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
transaction fee,

1198
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
which is nine cents.

1199
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
And we do want to put the

1200
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
the affiliate,

1201
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
the affiliate stuff

1202
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
into place,

1203
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
which I think is already

1204
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
in there.

1205
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
And I guess the songs

1206
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
that you can now purchase

1207
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
as of today are American

1208
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
heartbreaking, including the new one

1209
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
that I played for you today.

1210
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Podsafe for Peace

1211
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
and some Matthew Eble,

1212
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
so I'm Matthew Eble has been selling

1213
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
quite crazy.

1214
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I'm not at liberty to tell you,

1215
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
but he's sold,

1216
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I really a significant amount

1217
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
of songs.

1218
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
It's definitely beer money,

1219
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
definitely beer money,

1220
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
very beer and some gas money.

1221
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
So extremely pleased to see

1222
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
that happening.

1223
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
A couple more things about

1224
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
PMN here.

1225
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Hi, Adam.

1226
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
This is Tom from the

1227
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000

1228
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I've been doing a few podcasts now

1229
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
and has some feedback

1230
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
for the Podsafe music network.

1231
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
The first couple items here

1232
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
were mentioned by listeners,

1233
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
a few shows back,

1234
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
but I think it bears repeating.

1235
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
The first one is to bring back

1236
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
the music ratings.

1237
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I think that was a very useful

1238
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
feature.

1239
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
And I know it got replaced

1240
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
when you added the pay button,

1241
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
but it would be nice

1242
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
to be able to bring that back.

1243
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
You know, that's interesting

1244
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
that you say that.

1245
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
It didn't really get replaced

1246
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
by the buy button.

1247
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
It did on the page,

1248
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
but there was so much feedback,

1249
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
particularly from artists

1250
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
who said they did not want

1251
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
the ratings feature there.

1252
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
And I have to agree with you

1253
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
that from a podcaster perspective

1254
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
and perhaps from a listener perspective,

1255
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I thought it was kind of handy

1256
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
because, you know,

1257
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
if I'm surfing through the

1258
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
PMN,

1259
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
it's at music.podshow.com,

1260
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
by the way.

1261
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
You know,

1262
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
and I'd find a song

1263
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
that maybe I'd like the sound

1264
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
of the voice or whatever.

1265
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I'll click on the artist link

1266
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
or I'll go to the artist page

1267
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
and there would be,

1268
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
you know,

1269
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
definitely some feedback.

1270
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
And it either has all three stars,

1271
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
which I think,

1272
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
maybe that's part of the problem is

1273
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
you start off

1274
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
and you're always right in the middle of

1275
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
three stars.

1276
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
And some of them would actually

1277
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
have a higher rating

1278
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
and those would be the songs

1279
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
that listen to right up front.

1280
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
So maybe we take that out

1281
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
or maybe it's configurable

1282
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
or I don't know.

1283
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
But it's definitely something

1284
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
to think about.

1285
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I'm not completely an agreement

1286
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
that they're gone in their entirety.

1287
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
So I think that,

1288
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
yeah,

1289
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
maybe the artist hated it

1290
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
because they don't like to be rated,

1291
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
which is another thing

1292
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
to take into consideration.

1293
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
But from a podcaster perspective,

1294
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
finding the song that you want

1295
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
and having some form of feedback

1296
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
is important.

1297
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Now,

1298
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
when we unleash the podshow

1299
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
and the podshow PDN,

1300
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
you're going to see that we do have

1301
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
some a lot of interactive pieces

1302
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
that we've put into place.

1303
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
So people can let their

1304
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
feelings and comments be known

1305
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
about podcasts,

1306
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
but also about other listeners.

1307
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
So you're going to see

1308
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
some integration of that

1309
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
into songs and artists.

1310
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
So it may not be the star's rating system,

1311
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
but we are bringing something back

1312
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
that I think you'll like

1313
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
and we'll satisfy your needs.

1314
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Second is

1315
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
with more and more record companies

1316
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
uploading music.

1317
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
They're putting their name

1318
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
into the artist's field,

1319
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
and then they're forcing the song

1320
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
artist and title into the title field.

1321
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
In some cases,

1322
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
they're only putting the song title

1323
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
into the title field,

1324
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
which makes it very confusing.

1325
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Yeah, yeah,

1326
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
you're right about that.

1327
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Another thing that will be solved.

1328
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So labels,

1329
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
and of course,

1330
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
the concept of what is a label

1331
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
in the unlabel world,

1332
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
will be able to have a collection of

1333
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
favorite artists.

1334
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
So actually,

1335
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I could be a label.

1336
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Now that when we integrate

1337
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
all these pieces together,

1338
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
and I could say here are the

1339
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
ten artists that are on my label.

1340
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Of course,

1341
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
don't really have a label,

1342
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
but they are artists

1343
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
that I'll play on my podcast.

1344
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
They are artists

1345
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
that I want you to as a listener

1346
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
to my show to check out.

1347
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
And I'll also be helping

1348
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
to sell some of that music

1349
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
and as a podcaster,

1350
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
or as a listener

1351
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
who has a collection of artists

1352
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
and songs that you'll kind of

1353
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
call your label,

1354
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
you'll be able to participate

1355
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
in the proceeds of that.

1356
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
So that will also be solved,

1357
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
but not in the way you're seeing it today,

1358
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
but anyone will be able to be a label,

1359
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
which also means, of course,

1360
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
actual labels will have the same functionality.

1361
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
As if it can create another place

1362
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
to put the record companies name done,

1363
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
and then use the artist

1364
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
and title for what it's intended.

1365
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
The third one has to do with some

1366
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
strange song names, song titles.

1367
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I see titles like Delete the song,

1368
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I remove this file.

1369
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
And I think what's happening

1370
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
is that artists are trying to remove

1371
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
something from the network,

1372
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
not able to do it,

1373
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
and then they end up renaming it

1374
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
and hopes that somebody will go through

1375
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
and see that and remove it.

1376
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
So looks like that means it will be cleaned up.

1377
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Yeah, you're right.

1378
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
And that's because it's very easy to upload a song,

1379
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
but not very easy to remove it,

1380
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
which is kind of stupid on our part.

1381
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
So that, of course, will all be fixed.

1382
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
You'll be able to totally manage that.

1383
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
And I'm just going to skip over the last bit,

1384
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
and the next comment actually,

1385
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
because the next logical piece is the ID3 tags,

1386
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
and you know that the entire pod show,

1387
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
HQ, listens to the show,

1388
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
so they're already on it.

1389
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
When you upload a song,

1390
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
you will actually be forced to fill out

1391
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
a number of pieces of information of metadata,

1392
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
and those will be written into the ID3 tags,

1393
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
if they're not already there,

1394
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
of each song uploaded,

1395
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
so we'll have great ID3 tag information.

1396
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
We'll have a much richer database of information.

1397
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Oh, we just hired this new guy,

1398
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
he's a search specialist.

1399
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
God, man, it's nice to have a search specialist

1400
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
in the house.

1401
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
So, sod just hit the ground,

1402
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
running, I think, this week,

1403
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
and we're going to have some great search opportunities,

1404
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
both for pod state music,

1405
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
as well as for podcasts,

1406
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
really integrating the context

1407
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
and relevance of show notes.

1408
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
And obviously, also search on different users.

1409
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
So, that's all in the works.

1410
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Now, let's see a couple more things

1411
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I just wanted to catch up on.

1412
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Thank you to everyone who sent in

1413
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
the information that the cube product

1414
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
that was talking about

1415
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
is part of the email tax solution,

1416
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
was the cobalt cube,

1417
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
and later they came out with the RAC, RAC cube.

1418
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
And of course, that was bought by son,

1419
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
and I think it pretty much died

1420
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
a very short, effective death,

1421
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
because it was just way too cool

1422
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
and cutting into sons,

1423
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
core business for some reason.

1424
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
So, thanks for that.

1425
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Phil Walker, just a funny one here.

1426
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
He says, I'm listening to Chuck 350,

1427
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
and you're throwing the Roger Smalls MP3

1428
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
into the soundtrack.

1429
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I leap up to answer my mobile phone

1430
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
because it's got the Roger Smalls ringtone on it,

1431
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
and then I realize it's the Charlie Pump

1432
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
and through the office speakers.

1433
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
So, I sit down and the bloody mobile

1434
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
fires up with Rogers again.

1435
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Is it the phone or is it Adam?

1436
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Is it Roger?

1437
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
That's what you get in there

1438
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
and for using Roger Smalls is a ringtone.

1439
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
All right, final song for the day,

1440
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
and then I'm going to take a shower,

1441
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
get dressed and get ready to go to the shop.

1442
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I'm actually going to bring this up

1443
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
because this is a new addition, new entry,

1444
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
it was put in,

1445
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
how can I can't find pods,

1446
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
if music network here is so long.

1447
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
You know what? I'll play the song

1448
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
and then I'll find the information.

1449
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
It's a Dutch band from the northern part

1450
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
of the Netherlands from Croningen.

1451
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
They call themselves Tunebone.

1452
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And this is a real,

1453
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:27,000
very popular type of music in the Netherlands.

1454
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
You hear a lot of it more on the eastern side

1455
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
out towards Germany in what we call the back corner

1456
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
or the Achterhook,

1457
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
with dance like normal

1458
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
and you'll think it to food or beetles.

1459
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
And just whenever I hear a tune like this,

1460
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
it's such a combination of almost like Scandinavian influences,

1461
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
really heavy accents that only belong

1462
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
to the north or the eastern parts of the Netherlands,

1463
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
and just plain whole goddamn good rock and roll.

1464
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I'll be the neck.

1465
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
This should wake you up.

1466
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Certainly doing it for me.

1467
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I'll be the neck.

1468
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I'll be the neck.

1469
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I'll be the neck.

1470
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000

1471
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000

I'll be the neck.

1474
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000

1475
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000

00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I'll be the neck.

1480
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I'll be the neck.

1481
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I'll be the neck.

1482
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I'll be the neck.

1483
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000

You know,, Swane, I want to show off your keyprocessing that you come back from a very schoolship, start in there. Pick your�tus forgot yesterday, you know, what are the trains take at all all but they think about you, we are running a함.

1529
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:31,400
Once you don't live there anymore, I really do like the songs that these guys do.

1530
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,900
And as I said, there's a couple of bands in Holland that do it.

1531
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:38,400
They never get mainstream radio or rarely get mainstream radio aeroplane.

1532
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,400
And if it is, maybe it's one song a year or something that'll make it into the charge.

1533
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,400
So happy to share that one with you.

1534
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,400
Okay, it is light outside now.

1535
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,400
I don't think it's going to be a very nice day.

1536
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,400
I see no sun coming up over the bay.

1537
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:55,400
I just see clouds and concrete.

1538
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,400
So nice show, damn, over an hour.

01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,400

You know, Cali Lewis is going to be up here in San Francisco.

1541
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,400
We might be doing some video stuff together.

1542
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,400
There's always people stopping by.

1543
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,400
There's still a chance that we might be going to South by Southwest.

1544
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,400
I mean, I don't know what's happening.

1545
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,400
I'll let you know tomorrow.

1546
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,400
