1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Delta Shara Charley, 3-3-1

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We don't need no sticky drinks

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Fantastic, it's a battle curry

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Baby there's something that I like to say

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I hope that my words don't get in the way

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But there's something that you want to know

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I can't I explain all this love that I feel

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
How do I prove that this heart is for real?

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Now I don't just close, I don't want to let go

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I can no longer hide, there's some dying inside

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And I'm feeling like I'm gonna fall

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This is a dream that I don't want to wake

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This is a feeling I don't want to share

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And I can't make it to my own

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Because I'm afraid this will fade away

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's it

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's it, that's it

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And I'm lost

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sometimes I feel as though I don't deserve

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The love that you give but I'm so reassured

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Whenever you kiss me there in the dark

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
There is fire that's burning within

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
When I feel the passion the room starts to spin

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If you leave, I am left with a smile

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You are all I'll drink alone if I can't have your love

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I would rather have nothing else

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is a dream that I don't want to wake

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is a feeling I don't want to share

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And I can't make it to my own

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Because I'm afraid this will fade away

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's it, that's it, that's it

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And I'm lost

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Sometimes I feel as though I don't deserve

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Stay around

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I would give anything to hold you here

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
My own

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But what I've found

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Someone in a battle will be beautiful

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is a dream that I don't want to wake

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This is a feeling I don't want to share

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And I can't make it to my own

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Because I'm afraid this will fade away

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's it, that's it, that's it

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And I can't make it to my own

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Because I'm afraid this will fade away

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's it, that's it, that's it

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And I can't make it to my own

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I don't want the night turning into the rain

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,140
listening, well, I always enjoy listening to digital

74
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,340
flotsom because it's so nicely produced and there's so much

75
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,700
attention, it's paid to sound and editing.

76
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,740
And it this being the first year anniversary.

77
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,180
There was a lot of podcasts who checked in with

78
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,140
congratulatory messages.

79
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,020
It was really a nice warm fuzzy feeling overall,

80
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,380
but it really inspired me to work on the sound again.

81
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,860
And I learned some very important things about my

82
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,220
wonderful laptop, which of course is running cast

83
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,380
Blaster Software.

84
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,720
You can download a free trial at castblaster.com.

85
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,220
I have a creative labs sound card that I stuck in there.

86
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,060
And apparently, and for those of you who are not in the

87
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,060
note like myself or new to the PC platform,

88
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,100
and Windows can be quite mysterious, I have to say.

89
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,060
Apparently, there's all kinds of drivers and software

90
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,400
that is installed with the install CD and there's all

91
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,940
kinds of settings.

92
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,000
Who knew that the card was set to output optimized for

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,440
headphones?

94
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,780
I don't know what kind of headphones that we're talking about,

95
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,580
but when I switched it to stereo 2, speaker 2.1 or

96
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,140
whatever the option was,

97
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,820
oh boy, big, big change.

98
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,500
And I think you probably will notice that just listening

99
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,900
to Kevin Reeves, how good that sounded.

100
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,380
So really, I didn't figure it out until I did an A.B.

101
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,380
comparison with the internal sound card and said,

102
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,980
wait a minute, this thing can't suck that bad.

103
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,860
And on top of that, I got into it and started to

104
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,860
switch with Ling and tweaking the knobs on the TLA 5052

105
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,980
stereo valve processor.

106
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,740
So I hope you like the sound today.

107
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,660
And you've all been graded, giving me feedback and letting me know

108
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,500
what you think of it.

109
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,580
And so I think we finally struck on some kind of paid

110
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,020
heard here.

111
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,620
Also, thanks to everybody, I'm learning a lot about PCs

112
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,460
and Windows.

113
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,940
Who knew?

114
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,100
Thank you very much for sending back all of your reports.

115
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,700
Castblaster mic had already predicted that me reading along

116
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,060
with the time, so right now, this is what I did yesterday

117
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,220
if you weren't listening.

118
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,660
I said right now, I'm recording it seven minutes and 26 seconds,

119
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,100
27 seconds, 28 seconds.

120
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,140
And everyone, of course, immediately looked at their iPod

121
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,940
or MP3 player, or Jesus, we had people on Windows,

122
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,780
media player, and that was off on every single one of them.

123
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,060
I'll just run down a quick list because I must have received

124
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,140
50 of these reports.

125
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,940
Dave Smith, Windows Media Player 10,

126
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,500
show us about one second out from your to my timings.

127
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:57,700
Andrew Grummit from Podshow, four seconds off.

128
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,020
Sean Bartolls, let me see, you said 36.35.

129
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,020
At that point, on iTunes, it was 36.31.

130
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,300
So that's six seconds off.

131
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,380
On the iPod, Squid says, was it four seconds off?

132
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,340
Wind amp, four seconds off.

133
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,180
What's this next one here?

134
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,780
You were dead on a 2430 on my iPod.

135
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,900
I double-checked this, and it was the same every time.

136
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,900
OK, so I was 2430, I was dead on the money,

137
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,700
but then when I said 36.35, it showed 31.

138
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,820
It just goes on and on and on.

139
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,660
Of course, the amazing Kevin says, he Adam,

140
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,540
I was about three seconds behind when you announced

141
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,940
what your timer was.

142
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,980
I'm using iTunes 6.02 because, of course, I'm

143
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,660
lazy asked, listening to your show consistently,

144
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,420
enjoying the hell out of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

145
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,860
I'd like to plug something, but I have nothing to plug yet.

146
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,660
There will be a podcast from you someday, damn it.

147
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,300
But if you want, plug Coca-Cola for me.

148
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,820
Great product does wonders for cooking

149
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,620
and your battery posts on your car.

150
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,380
Have a good one.

151
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,700
Thanks, Kevin.

152
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,900
So here's what's going on with all this.

153
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,940
Timers in general suck.

154
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,980
And you'd think that they be on the money.

155
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,300
It's just amazing to me, these discrepancies

156
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,180
of three to four seconds.

157
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,980
It's pretty outrageous, actually.

158
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,340
And it's not my fault or your fault or anyone's fault per say.

159
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,620
It's just that most timers, the software that do timers,

160
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,740
are just kind of easy about their timing.

161
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,900
And particularly when it comes to MP3,

162
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,300
it's not doing the sort of checking that this timer

163
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,460
that's built into cast blasters now doing.

164
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,060
It's actually taking the sample rate

165
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,740
and dividing it by the number of samples

166
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,340
and making sure the moon is in Aquarius

167
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,740
and praising Murphy and standing on one foot and all that stuff.

168
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,340
But actually it's very scientific.

169
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:47,340
And if you were to measure out the exact length,

170
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,140
based on real time, real world time,

171
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,260
it's now exactly right.

172
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,740
It's really that timer is all these devices that are off.

173
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,940
The interesting that iTunes seems to come

174
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,380
the closest when it comes to that.

175
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,420
So anyways, just, it really doesn't matter

176
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,940
because podcasting is no longer about time

177
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,060
and frequency and dimension and all that stuff.

178
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,260
So, but it's all solved.

179
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,740
Thank you.

180
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,700
And really all we're doing this for is just to make sure

181
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,700
that PW and I had exactly the same timing.

182
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,460
Although this could come in handy

183
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,540
if you're doing a so-called double-ender,

184
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,860
this is something Don and Drew pioneered.

185
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,740
The double-ender is where you basically have a conversation

186
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,660
on Skype and you each record your own portion.

187
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,780
And then later you mix the two together.

188
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,060
Now, if you were to do it on two separate PCs

189
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:42,540
with two separate timers, you'd probably wind up

190
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,100
with a discrepancy of three to four seconds

191
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,260
depending on how long the show is.

192
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,780
Now, I presume if you do it with cast blaster,

193
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,980
then you will have exactly the same time reference

194
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,340
for both those files.

195
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,820
Good, now we've got that past us.

196
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,180
Something you might have noticed in the news, Paul Nayeric,

197
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,340
actually said, I remember on David Sorsko

198
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,300
a few months back talking how you wish people could share

199
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,660
their hotspots, got a lot of those emails

200
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,780
because this new site called phone,

201
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:18,780
FOXTRAOT-OscarNobemberFone.com is, well, it is essentially

202
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,820
what I was hoping for a while back.

203
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,940
And of course, this was already being done in open sources.

204
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,700
The idea of creating some kind of firmware

205
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,420
that you could easily load into your Wi-Fi hotspot

206
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,620
that would enable people to share your bandwidth

207
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,220
based upon a couple of rule sets.

208
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,740
And I think that I shall look at the article here.

209
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,500
I don't know if it has those.

210
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,260
There was like pirate, wizard, llama, something like that.

211
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:52,260
Let me see if I can find the different levels of openness.

212
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,700
Like it's not have to go back to foam.com to figure it out.

213
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,900
But anyway, it's Google and Skype

214
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,340
who are putting this together.

215
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,860
And this is, I think this is just phenomenally interesting.

216
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,980
Because once you get software,

217
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,580
you get people to actually be able to load software easily

218
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,020
onto these routers, which will enable you to say,

219
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,700
hey, I want no one to share my bandwidth.

220
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,900
I want anyone to share my bandwidth or I want anyone

221
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,460
to be able to share between these and these hours, et cetera.

222
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,140
Once you've got that done, then we can start thinking

223
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,980
about if we have enough of these hotspots

224
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,500
about really layering a whole new network on top of everything

225
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,180
else, which presumably could be something

226
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,180
like a mesh network of Wi-Fi hotspots.

227
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:35,540
I don't know.

228
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,900
There's all kinds of great stuff.

229
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,580
And I've learned that when it's totally technically

230
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:46,100
possible to do this, excuse me, that was nasty.

231
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,100
Download.acview.com.

232
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,020
Yeah, that's my new Vulcan Mind trick.

233
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,300
So I'm trying, I'm going to try and deprogram everybody

234
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,060
from the Senseo link to the burp.

235
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,580
So I'll just mention different sponsors each time I do that.

236
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,580
And I'll do a different one each time,

237
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,220
so that we can deprogram you.

238
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,700
If something sticks, let me know, though,

239
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,540
because I'll have to work on you personally.

240
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,340
Anyway, I've learned that when something is technically

241
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,780
possible, but isn't being done because well,

242
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,140
factors like bandwidth or scale or attention, et cetera.

243
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,460
Just wait five years.

244
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,140
And it'll probably be here.

245
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,540
Something very similar to what we're talking about,

246
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,060
or what we've been talking about in the past,

247
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,820
well, on the past couple of months here,

248
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,300
on the Daily Source Code.

249
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,580
And just when you thought you wouldn't hear from them again,

250
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,580
yeah.

251
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:39,580
What you've got here is another message round that you're strong.

252
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:45,420
That you're strong, that you're strong, that you're strong.

253
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,620
Hi, I'm Roger Hea.

254
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,420
You know, we've got Valentine's Day coming out soon.

255
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,380
And I haven't actually got a girlfriend yet.

256
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,340
I was wondering if she'd have to help me out.

257
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,660
So I think this year's the three next week.

258
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,140
Can you make it go out and make some 50 girls, Frank?

259
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:03,180
I think with your good looks and my assistance

260
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,900
and my 8 million pounds worth of cardiac reasons.

261
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,620
I'm sure we could find some girls to talk to.

262
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,020
I think with many love, we'll begin exactly three p.

263
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,740
for the end of the night if you're interested.

264
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,020
Right now, I just remember you don't actually think,

265
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,060
so maybe if you'd give me a minute in your parties of car,

266
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,780
that would be certainly a lot cheaper than the taxi.

267
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,100
And you've got my address.

268
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,260
So I'll look forward to you back in 30.

269
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,460
I think it's not very romantic, shea, but not a whole shea

270
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,740
into the back of the car.

271
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,500
So I'll swap the parties to live there.

272
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,940
Actually, other stations still got your helicopter

273
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,780
because they're really well in crest girls,

274
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,740
but you will have trouble talking and it out.

275
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,460
Roger, what the hell are you talking about?

276
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,920
If I knew to directly post Roger now

277
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,240
wants to go out on a date

278
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,100
with me to go pick up chicks?

279
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,700
And we're supposed to do that with Bacardi Boresers.

280
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,420
Ooooo.

281
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,040
Roger, I'd love to.

282
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,980
Unfortunately, I've got to travel so I can't

283
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,580
make it for the next couple of weeks, but the idea's good.

284
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,820
Maybe, you know, we could just meet

285
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,600
for lunch or something and kind of ease into a personal relationship

286
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,700
before we can go out cruising for chicks.

287
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,100
And I don't have the helicopter anymore.

288
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,140
It's a, it basically wrong machine for my mission.

289
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,740
If the only place is I'm flying or, you know, to rotter dam

290
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,500
or maybe some other place in the UK and really fixed wing

291
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,380
as much better for that.

292
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,060
So maybe we'll just drive.

293
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,820
But let's, let's meet for lunch first.

294
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,180
Let's take it one step at a time.

295
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,900
And I hear by the way that your jingle is now one of the hottest

296
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,060
exchange ringtones in the UK.

297
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,060
Yeah.

298
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,220
And you can't eat.

299
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,220
You can't eat.

300
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,220
You can't eat.

301
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,220
You can't eat.

302
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,220
You can't eat.

303
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,220
You can't eat.

304
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,220
You can't eat.

305
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,220
You can't eat.

306
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,220
You can't eat.

307
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,220
You can't eat.

308
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,220
You can't eat.

309
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,660
Totally got to get that on my phone as a ringtone.

310
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,260
Simon Powell says Adam, some of your listeners have been mentioning

311
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,980
on the Charlie lately.

312
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,220
I'd like that on the Charlie.

313
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,460
They often get asked how much can I listen to a podcast without an

314
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,020
iPod or how can I listen to a podcast without an iPod?

315
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,500
I have had that a lot too.

316
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,780
And so I've set up a site about this.

317
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,940
This is actually a pretty damn good idea.

318
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,220
Still basically, I want to develop a good resource

319
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,740
where you can direct a friend.

320
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,860
Basically, it's, well, a second.

321
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,500
Let me make sure I get the, isn't this the address?

322
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,620
Oh, shoot.

323
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,340
I think it's no iPod.

324
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,180
This is so stupid.

325
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,220
How could I have not saved the link?

326
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,060
Hold on a second.

327
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,900
Let me just see what's his name, Simon.

328
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,500
Gmail to the rescue, right?

329
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,340
Let me see.

330
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,300
Simon.

331
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,300
I thought I was no iPod required.com,

332
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,220
but let me just check.

333
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,380
I don't want to mess it up.

334
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,500
Here we go.

335
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,340
Incoming.

336
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,260
Yeah, no iPod required.com.

337
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,220
So yeah, if someone has that question,

338
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,420
just go to the site, no iPod required.com.

339
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,900
I think it's a great initiative, dude.

340
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,020
That's totally the type of stuff that we need to be doing.

341
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,300
And check this out, man.

342
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,380
This came in on the BBC in Peru.

343
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:20,380
Podcasts are being used to bring agricultural information

344
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,740
to villagers and farmers.

345
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,620
I'll just read a bit from this from the BBC

346
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,580
in Peru's remote and de-in-mountains.

347
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,940
Villages like Shanta Alta only have electricity

348
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,420
for two hours a day, despite this a new pilot project

349
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,900
is using podcasting to get important agricultural information

350
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,140
to farmers.

351
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,180
The farmers do not yet have the means

352
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,180
to listen on portable MP3 players.

353
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,980
And of course, they'll be surfing on immediately

354
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,340
to noopipodrequired.com.

355
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,620
UK charity, practical action, has married

356
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,900
old and new technology to podcast twice months,

357
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,100
twice monthly updates to eight information centers

358
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,020
in the Kajamaqa region.

359
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,300
This is really cool.

360
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,580
Who are these guys, practical action?

361
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,700
They're doing something good there.

362
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,500
This is very, very cool.

363
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,140
So I'll make sure there's a link to that on the show notes

364
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,820
for today.

365
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,100
And of course, it'll show up in the time-code-based show notes

366
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,100
at the wiki it's show notes, dotting foe.

367
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,380
Also something new that I noticed in my Gmail account today

368
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,740
is next to, you have your inbox, star,

369
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,940
your sent mail, your drafts, and your spam,

370
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,860
and your trash folders.

371
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,820
There's now a new one that popped up called chats.

372
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,980
And there's nothing in there.

373
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,100
And it looks exactly like you'd expect,

374
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,780
or a link.

375
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:44,580
Exactly like you'd expect a mail folder to look like.

376
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,780
Only what they're going to do, it doesn't work yet.

377
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,620
I guess if you have Google Talk,

378
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:55,260
which is their chat client, your history will show up there

379
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,940
just like email.

380
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,700
And they say pretty soon, chat in Gmail is coming.

381
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,660
So that's pretty interesting.

382
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:06,420
Integrating the integrating chats with email in Gmail.

383
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,460
I do have, obviously, you automatically

384
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:14,100
have a Google chat account when you sign up for Gmail

385
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,740
or any other Google service I believe, but still.

386
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,740
That could be interesting to use.

387
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,180
I pretty much use Skype all the time for instant messaging.

388
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,500
It seems to be what we're using around the office,

389
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,340
the most as well.

390
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,780
And now let us talk briefly about the cartoons.

391
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,860
This, of course, is topic of the day.

392
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,220
Everywhere except newspapers, interestingly enough,

393
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,620
the newspapers are very shy here in the UK

394
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,820
about really delving into this very deeply.

395
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,220
But from what I understand is that a top Iranian newspaper

396
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,740
has now written out a contest for, let's see,

397
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,660
what's the name of the newspaper, the Hamshari.

398
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,140
They're looking for, oh, this is really bad.

399
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,300
They're looking for cartoons and characteratures

400
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,740
that they can publish in response.

401
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,380
Now let me say a couple of things about this.

402
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,740
First of all, I love it.

403
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:19,460
I love the idea of using creativity and words and pictures

404
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,660
and art to express ourselves as human being

405
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,220
across any boundaries that we have to cross.

406
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:26,900
I love it.

407
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,500
Let me tell you, the stuff people write can be,

408
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,620
I think, as hurtful as sticking a knife in you.

409
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,540
In fact, I've seen many people have the exact same reaction.

410
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,020
And we're really good at it online, aren't we, guys?

411
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:46,020
We're really good at yelling and flaming and hurting each other

412
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,380
and it gets the emotions going.

413
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,540
It really gets you riled up.

414
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,900
And I think we do that quite a lot.

415
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,860
Maybe not just on forums, maybe it's with office workers,

416
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,020
on email, it could be through SMS.

417
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,740
And there's all kinds of ways that we lose our aggressive

418
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,180
energy that way.

419
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,220
And clearly, there's a lot of people

420
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,380
where they don't have these outlets.

421
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,540
I say, let's get them some terminals.

422
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,300
Let's get them some video cameras.

423
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,740
They can do video podcasts.

424
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,580
Let's set them up.

425
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,340
Let's get them help.

426
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,540
Let's start the dialogue.

427
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,540
Let's start yelling and screaming at each other.

428
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,540
Let's do it online.

429
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,740
A perfect place for it.

430
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:24,580
I'm very, very excited about, of course,

431
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,780
I'm doing it with mainstream media first.

432
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,980
But it can't be that far off for it.

433
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,260
And I think we should help them.

434
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,620
So I'm going to move the blank very away.

435
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,740
I think we should help move them into the debate online.

436
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,740
They're already sending out threatening emails.

437
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,140
So they've gotten that far.

438
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,940
So maybe we have to create an email to weblogs system

439
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,100
just so that they can participate and maybe a weblog

440
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,660
to email system news readers.

441
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,980
Come on, there's got to be some way that we can do this.

442
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,420
I mean, we shouldn't be afraid to give them the technology.

443
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,500
So we can go to a new battlefield, a new place.

444
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,380
I'd love it.

445
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,460
Now, that said, I think it's really unfortunate

446
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:07,460
that what this seems to boil down to is Muslims versus Jews.

447
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,900
It's like, how many hundreds of years

448
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,140
do we have to deal with this shit?

449
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,420
That's so disappointing.

450
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,380
And it's, you know, it's fundamentally

451
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:28,020
to not believe it's about the religious part of the conversation.

452
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,420
It's really about cultures.

453
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:34,180
And it's something that dates back to dates back a long time.

454
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,620
And it just continues.

455
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,740
And it seems a fucking pointless.

456
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,500
But I'd love to have more conversations about it.

457
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,580
At least if we can do that.

458
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,460
And by the way, I think what's happening in Western Europe

459
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,020
is just a repeat of history.

460
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,100
When the Roman Empire existed, which, of course,

461
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,300
was all of Europe with Rome being the capital.

462
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,420
There was actually in Constantinople, which, of course,

463
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,460
that we know as Istanbul, was really the eastern capital

464
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,420
of the Roman Empire.

465
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:10,420
And by the way, the Christians,

466
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:15,980
were very much where they had a very similar attitude

467
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,020
or they projected a very similar attitude to what we see today

468
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,940
from what we call radical extremists.

469
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,820
Now, they didn't have ways to blow themselves up in public,

470
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,660
but they showed a complete lack of fear

471
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,780
when they were thrown to the lions.

472
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,420
And it really puzzled the Romans.

473
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,020
And this is, of course, only from the history,

474
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,420
I've learned it, you know, correct me if I'm wrong.

475
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,180
But it really was a protest.

476
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,060
And there was no religion in Rome.

477
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,020
It's like, everyone, we got a whole bunch of gods.

478
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,900
Well, hey, you know, your god looks like our god.

479
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,420
That's cool.

480
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,740
You can come live with us.

481
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,860
And slowly, that started to decline.

482
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,820
I believe what really happened is the, quote, barbarians,

483
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,220
and Christians who were outside of the empire

484
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,420
and wanting to come in, they eventually were led in.

485
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,340
And they were led in unneeded.

486
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,740
And what happened is it was just, the infrastructure

487
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,620
could not support all the, quote, barbarians

488
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,660
that were brought in.

489
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:18,220
And that's probably a little bit of what we're seeing right now

490
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,620
with immigration in Europe.

491
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,260
Now, that said, we're going to continue on the podcast,

492
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,580
talking about this for a couple minutes.

493
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,100
Folks on serious satellites, they tuned for Pacific Coast

494
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:29,460
Hellway.

495
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,740
It's next.

496
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,740
God, I love doing that exactly on time.

497
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,660
Ha, of course, there are other opinions.

498
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:41,940
Aaron Warmus said, I believe that the cartoons were just

499
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,140
the last straw, stuff bothers me all the time.

500
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,060
I can ignore it because I can say that it's just a cartoon.

501
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,980
However, if it were my perception that I was being persecuted

502
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,940
for religious reasons, then I probably wouldn't stand

503
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,380
for this form of what could be seen as adding insult

504
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:56,900
to injury.

505
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,020
Simply, we are not just publishing cartoons.

506
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,180
We're invading countries, torturing killing innocent people,

507
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,140
stealing oil and publishing the offensive cartoons,

508
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,740
just my two euro cents.

509
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,180
Okay, duly noted.

510
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,260
But, you know, there's a lot, this is this stuff.

511
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,580
If once again, it boils down to these two religions,

512
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,260
battling it out, then this has been going on way before

513
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,460
quote stealing of oil and publishing of cartoons.

514
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,740
It just seems like it's the same damn thing.

515
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,700
And it's disappointing.

516
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,260
But I really do hope we could bring really, really do hope

517
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:39,180
we can bring more voices into this.

518
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,140
Let's help them out.

519
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,260
So maybe they won't have to be shooting AKs

520
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,020
and throwing eggs and torturing stuff

521
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,020
to get attention and lose some of that aggressive energy.

522
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,940
I see, I see, I know myself.

523
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,180
It feels great sometimes to flame someone.

524
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,940
And of course, when you get flamed,

525
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,460
it comes back at in different ways, but it is that energy.

526
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,580
It's the same thing.

527
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,500
And you'll be able to hurt people just as much.

528
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,340
Just as much.

529
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,540
And you can love people just as much.

530
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,980
I just wanted to revisit the censorship

531
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:11,980
of the Rolling Stones Super Bowl halftime performance.

532
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,700
The ridiculousness of them cutting out

533
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,300
just two short phrases from these songs

534
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,620
that have been, that the stones have been playing

535
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,860
for over 30 years, that played on the radio

536
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,100
around the world.

537
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,580
This is really mainstream media's version of jumping the shark

538
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,700
to have to censor that out for whatever reason,

539
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,300
whatever fear they had of a repeat of the Janet Jackson

540
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,260
wardrobe malfunction saga.

541
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,180
And last night I was watching the news.

542
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,540
It was BBC News 24.

543
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,540
And what they do a lot here in the evening

544
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,660
is they review the Morning's Papers.

545
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,820
And this was just, it's a laughing stock.

546
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,500
It is the laughing stock that this is going on.

547
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,740
And it just shows what a disconnect this is taking place.

548
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,380
And I'll just say with mainstream media,

549
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,420
I mean, I don't know where it's coming from.

550
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:13,420
And what parts of governmental backing these types

551
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,420
of or influence government influence these types

552
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:22,420
of censorship moments have just, it's so stupid.

553
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:28,700
From the country with the largest pornographic industry

554
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,700
on earth, and with the best porn movies I might had,

555
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,740
how can it have come this far?

556
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:40,300
I'm so happy we have other ways to get creativity art

557
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:44,620
and words, oh, yes, words out there, really.

558
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:47,020
Do you believe anything is possible?

559
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,940
We do.

560
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,580
Where are flink?

561
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,660
We believe in an internet that's safe from viruses

562
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,820
and scammers.

563
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,460
Where are flink?

And we believe your internet should be a friend, not a foe.

Earthlink, we revolve around you.

571
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,380
I got an email yesterday from KJ, got some great news.

572
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,100
I told you that this is an ongoing dialogue

573
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,700
and is we're reinventing media and reinventing,

574
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,980
probably not just reinventing, but evolutionizing,

575
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:34,380
radio, television, print, through whatever we can do on the internet.

576
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,580
Advertising is going to come along with that.

577
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,980
And I got an email yesterday, the Earthlink folks

578
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,660
have definitely gotten the message and we've come up with an idea

579
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,020
that I think will blow you away.

580
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,300
And obviously, I can't tell you right now,

581
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,540
but it should be happening within the next two weeks.

582
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,540
I think we start, yeah, I think we start March 1 or something

583
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,740
like that.

584
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,180
And I really think you'll like it and you'll be really happy.

585
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,860
And I will just show that we actually had a dialogue

586
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,820
between listeners and between an advertiser

587
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,540
and I'm really, really excited about it.

588
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:12,020
So just wanted to mention that, too.

589
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,300
I had him.

590
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,980
I've heard you talk about netting on your show before.

591
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,140
I've heard about the netting Olympics,

592
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,140
the alternative to the winter Olympics.

593
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:24,260
There are currently two and a half hours netters signed up

594
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,700
to this, it's all done on the internet.

595
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,460
With podcasts and bloggers.

596
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,500
I'm going to find out more about this on yonhawit.com.

597
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,540
Right on yonhawit.com, was that it?

598
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,620
Yon, yarn, yarn, harlot?

599
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,820
Of course, there's an Olympic because I'll Olympics for knitting.

600
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,620
I knew that.

601
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,860
I actually, I think I talked about knitting in this piece

602
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,140
that I was interviewed for German television.

603
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:55,500
It's state-run television, ZDF, which is

604
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,700
so I just do it you fancy and pretty good piece.

605
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,340
I must say, although I think my hair,

606
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,980
Patricia looked at it, she goes like, yeah, yeah,

607
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,660
it's really good because she understands German perfectly well.

608
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,740
And she said, what's with the Donald Trump hair?

609
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,140
I'm like, oh man, I'm so crushed.

610
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,300
You know, I'm out there in San Francisco all by myself.

611
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,540
And I think I've made no secret of it whatsoever

612
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,020
that I just can't do my own hair or the way Patricia can.

613
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,180
I miss it terribly.

614
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,860
My questions have been answered about speed limits in the UK.

615
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:33,140
OK, so clearly doing 90 miles an hour was not a good idea.

616
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,180
P.W. Fetton actually said that was dangerous.

617
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,980
And of course it is.

618
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:43,060
But I got, let me see, Paul from the flashing 12th podcast.

619
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,660
He sent me this lovely page, which has all the different speed

620
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,860
limits, because we have dual carriageway here.

621
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,540
We have a single carriageway, and we have the motorway.

622
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,620
Subsequently, it's 60, 70 and 70.

623
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,940
So the top speed limit is 70 miles an hour, which isn't too bad,

624
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,940
actually.

625
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:09,420
And I got, who was it now that said that basically, they'll give you,

626
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:12,380
who else, Richard Smith, he goes to the same thing here.

627
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,100
OK, if you're caught above 90, you may be looking at massive

628
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,380
speeding fines and possibly charge with dangerous driving.

629
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,060
If you're seen around the 80 mile per hour mark

630
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,380
and are seen to be slowing down by the police,

631
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,780
you probably will get away with it.

632
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:28,060
Yeah, so from what I understand, the kind of general rule of thumb

633
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:32,740
is it's 10% plus three miles per hour.

634
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,340
So if you're doing, if you're supposed to be doing 70,

635
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,740
it would be 77, plus three would be 80,

636
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,620
and then you're kind of OK.

637
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:43,420
But in general, we shall also just keep the speed limits, I guess.

638
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:46,540
And we clear up the thing about the two chefs mark yesterday.

639
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,340
Chef Mark from New York says, Adam sounds great.

640
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,620
Actually, I spell my name with a K at the end

641
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,940
from Mark and Chef Mark is with a C.

642
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,620
But I've been in contact with them about the name,

643
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,660
although I think there's a slight difference in weight class.

644
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,140
We may go ahead and do the whole wrestling match thing.

645
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,460
That would be great.

646
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,620
We need to throw down in the Truffle's chalk.

647
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,860
At Truffle's shavings topped chocolate

648
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,860
between the two chefs, Chef Marks, to see who really is the true

649
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,500
Chef Mark.

650
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,580
And I got to tell you, Mark, with the K,

651
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:18,940
you may be in trouble when it comes to the all drawn battle royale.

652
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,340
It could be tough for you.

653
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,500
OK, let me see, what are we doing now?

654
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,500
Well, 32 minutes.

655
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,500
Good.

656
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,700
I got a couple more things to do with you.

657
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,140
This is, of course, the place where us guys get together

658
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:49,260
and talk about things like, well, about me not being able to do my hair on a pure frustration.

659
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:53,460
Actually, if I, one of these days, I should go through the whole rigour roll that

660
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:58,900
I have to do, just have my hair kind of look like anything that is not the Mona Lisa.

661
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,180
It involves a lot of product, OK?

662
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:06,820
And by the way, nothing we talk about here in the Metro sexual moment is a paid advertisement.

663
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,580
This is just an open conversation.

664
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,180
Still waiting for a sponsor to come in to sponsor it, but it certainly wouldn't be

665
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,180
gelat.

666
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,180
I've got to wait too much money.

667
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,180
I don't think that needs a sponsor anyway at this point.

668
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,260
Besides, we could take it anymore, because the only thing would accept

669
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,860
would be freeraisers for registered listeners of the Daily Source code.

670
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:28,100
Let's get to some comments in the Metro sexual corner of the podcast.

671
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,100
Hello there, Anna.

672
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,100
What are you doing?

673
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,100
It's here's Wichita Rutherford.

674
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,860
Now, let me tell you something.

675
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:41,460
That the day after listening to your Metro sexual moment, I actually had one myself.

676
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,860
And it made me a little uncomfortable because the fellow I was with, it made me uncomfortable

677
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,020
about the situation.

678
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:54,020
I know, but this is it, Miles Nails.

679
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:57,020
Oh, look at you.

680
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,020
So this is where you go at your blade.

681
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,020
That's right.

682
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,020
Come out of the bone in here.

683
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,020
There you go.

684
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,020
What do you do?

685
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,020
That starts with your blue blaster a little hard.

686
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,020
Wichita, I have to tell you I'm not comfortable here.

687
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,020
Oh, we'll actually crack.

688
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,020
Nobody cares if you're getting a manicure.

689
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,020
And who do you know it's going to be here?

690
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,020
I'm serious, it's making very uncomfortable.

691
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,020
It's not cool, it's not cool.

692
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,020
See, this is what I'm talking about.

693
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,020
Girl, I don't care what you're talking about.

694
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,020
This is, I don't want anyone to think on the top of person that would come in here and do this.

695
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:32,020
You need to get in touch with your feminine side, my little friend.

696
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,020
Yeah, but yes, but yes.

697
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,020
You sat down, let me do your fingernails.

698
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,020
You ain't that big a human.

699
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:43,020
Well, if anybody sees me, they're going to think I'm, thank your watch.

700
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,020
Well, they're going to think I'm.

701
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,020
Metrosexual?

702
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,020
Well, there's nothing wrong with it.

703
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,020
Hey, I'm straight.

704
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,020
I'm a guy and you're a guy.

705
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,020
Me and you use buddies.

706
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,020
And in the middle is Metrosexual.

707
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:02,020
And that puts both of our sexual orientations,

708
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,020
hone an even playing ground.

709
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,020
That's why I can do it all your little parties and bars

710
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,020
and not feel weird.

711
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,020
Hang in around people like Gladys.

712
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,020
Who's real name is Phil?

713
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:16,020
So you're saying it's like common ground for all of us.

714
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,020
Bingo!

715
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,020
Now, sit down.

716
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,020
Because after this, we're going to go shopping for hats.

717
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,020
Ooh!

718
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,020
You'll thank you.

719
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,020
Wait till you see us all steps and number I've been looking at.

720
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,020
Nice huh?

721
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,020
Come fake clothes, eh?

722
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,020
Who let's get adventures after this?

723
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,020
Hey, leave me!

724
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,020
Can we get pennies after our manny?

725
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:37,020
Metrosexual?

726
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,020
Metrosexual?

727
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,020
Metrosexual?

728
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,020
Metrosexual?

729
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,020
Metrosexual?

730
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,020
Metrosexual?

731
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:50,020
It's an encourage Metrosexual moment.

732
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:54,020
An encourage Metrosexual moment.

733
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,020
Yeah.

734
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,020
Hi Adam.

735
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,020
This is Chris from the MathCred podcast.

736
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,020
Thanks to your show.

737
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,020
I have switched to a non-alcoholic aftershave.

738
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:06,020
And I now use a moisturizer with SPF-15.

739
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,020
I'm planning to look this good forever.

740
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:13,020
I have a tip and a question for the Metrosexual moment.

741
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,020
First the tip.

742
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,020
I don't recall ever hearing you mention the cuticle tool.

743
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:20,020
You can get one for a couple bucks at the drugstore,

744
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,020
and it keeps your nails looking sharp.

745
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,020
To be honest, I can barely tell the difference,

746
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:28,020
but I guarantee the ladies will notice and they love it.

747
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,020
Now for my question.

748
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,020
No matter what cream or razor I use,

749
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,020
the lowest part that I shave, you know,

750
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,020
the part that's more neck than face,

751
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,020
gets red and irritated and razor burned when I shave.

752
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,020
This is true, even on the first run with a new razor.

753
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,020
Please help me out.

754
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,020
Then head over to my podcast.

755
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:50,020
I discuss the mathematics behind every day situations.

756
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,020
Check it out.

757
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,020
The MathCred podcast and MathCred.com.

758
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,020
Thanks Adam.

759
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,020
Yeah, good question dude.

760
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,020
I actually have exactly the same problem.

761
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,020
No matter what I do,

762
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,020
usually it's all razor burned down in the lower regions.

763
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,020
This morning, actually, on my way out,

764
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:08,020
I nick myself with the mock free turbo razor.

765
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,020
It was like a neat little V shape.

766
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,020
I have no idea why that happened.

767
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,020
That has not happened ever since I've used it,

768
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:18,020
but yeah, if anyone has any thoughts about razor burn

769
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,020
and how to circumvent that,

770
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,020
it would be welcome here in our little Metro sexual moments.

771
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,020
Hi Adam.

772
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:28,020
This is Derek and I live in Alberta, Canada,

773
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,020
and 14 years old,

774
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,020
and I have a Metro sexual moment for you.

775
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,020
I use two products that I got for Christmas

776
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,020
in a skincare package type thing,

777
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,020
and they're both made by say knives,

778
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,020
and because I'm in my teens,

779
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,020
I do have some problems with acne.

780
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,020
I really don't have it that bad,

781
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,020
but I do get stuff for months and a while.

782
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,020
So, I use two products.

783
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,020
I want to use in the shower,

784
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,020
and I want to use after.

785
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,020
One is an apricot,

786
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,020
deep cleaning cream cleanser,

787
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,020
and it is supposed to not dry out of your skin.

788
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,020
It doesn't have any oil in it.

789
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,020
I really like that.

790
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,020
It's good for my acne,

791
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,020
and then during the winter's in Canada,

792
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,020
it gets quite dry.

793
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,020
So, my skin tends to dry out.

794
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:20,020
So, I use a product called 24-hour moisture,

795
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:25,020
and it's advanced moisturizing lotion,

796
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,020
and it seems to work really well for me,

797
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,020
and it makes my skin nice and soft.

798
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,020
So, I have those two products,

799
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,020
and I really love those.

800
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,020
I hope that helps with the image of sexual moment.

801
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:40,020
You can visit my website at your voice.cjb.net.

802
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,020
And I've got some cool stuff there, so thanks.

803
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,020
Bye.

804
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,020
Yo dude, thank you very much.

805
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,020
And make no mistake.

806
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,020
Particularly to the younger listeners,

807
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:51,020
you want to be moisturizing from the minute

808
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,020
you hear my voice talking about it,

809
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,020
because when you get old, like me, old and decrepit,

810
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,020
you're going to be really, really, really, really happy.

811
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,020
Because your skin will just be nice and supple,

812
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,020
and you won't have those wrinkles,

813
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,020
and it may not matter to you right now,

814
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,020
but boy, I'm telling you, it will one day.

815
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:10,020
I'm going to make you a sexual moment.

816
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,020
Yeah.

817
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:15,020
I learned a lot about mixing multiple sound sources

818
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,020
and cast blaster on that one.

819
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,020
I completely forgotten that completely forgotten

820
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:22,020
the fur that I've heard had done his own music.

821
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,020
So, oops, sorry about that.

822
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,020
It's still learning, but it's coming together now.

823
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,020
And I think the sound, I think,

824
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,020
basically got it there.

825
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,020
I've got it in a good place.

826
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,020
Of course, I may be listening to this now

827
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:34,020
and cringing because it's clipping and distorting

828
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,020
all over the place.

829
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,020
Who knows?

830
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,020
Okay, to wrap it up today,

831
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,020
a little update on what's going on,

832
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,020
Pod Show HQ.

833
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,020
Talk to Chris Rockwell.

834
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,020
Looks like Thursday will be able to start

835
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,020
the first beta test of purchasing.

836
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,020
To quote him, he's so close.

837
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,020
He can barely taste it.

838
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,020
I think it's what his exact words were.

839
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,020
And the whole thing is we wanted to have,

840
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,020
the one account, the one store,

841
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,020
of course, to want to have it to be persistent,

842
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,020
log on into the, you know,

843
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,020
the Pod Save Music Network and into the purchasing

844
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,020
and there's all these security issues

845
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,020
which he kind of had,

846
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,020
I got a little bit too excited last time I said

847
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,020
we were going to start betaing it.

848
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,020
But it looks like it's coming together

849
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,020
and the affiliate stuff,

850
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,020
which is all the unlabeled pieces.

851
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,020
Those will be rolling out very shortly as well.

852
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,020
So we're getting somewhere.

853
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,020
The same time I've actually been able

854
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,020
to invite a couple of outsiders

855
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:31,020
into the Pod Cast delivery network

856
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,020
and the Pod Show Plus.

857
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,020
Oh yeah, what's that?

858
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,020
Pod Show Plus.

859
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,020
Oh, secret.

860
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,020
Of course, I was really stupid about inviting people

861
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,020
because the confirmation email

862
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,020
when you sign up,

863
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,020
doesn't go directly to you.

864
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,020
So it has to go through one,

865
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,020
at this point it's going through,

866
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,020
I think Sue or Kevin,

867
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,020
and then they forward it on.

868
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,020
That was like an extra measure we put in there.

869
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,020
I can't for the life of me remember why.

870
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,020
But it's just great to see this stuff coming together,

871
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,020
particularly from afar,

872
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,020
you know, I've logged in now to the bug database

873
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,020
and I can put stuff in there

874
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,020
and you see status of it is actually

875
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,020
it's coming together and it's getting very,

876
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,020
very, very close.

877
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,020
And you should be hearing some,

878
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,020
some podcasters pretty soon

879
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,020
who actually will be up and running on the system

880
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,020
and hopefully with as much ease

881
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:27,020
as we've all, as we've all dreamt about.

882
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,020
For me.

883
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,020
Hold on a second.

884
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,020
What's that?

885
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,020
It's probably P-Dub

886
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,020
complaining about the show.

887
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,020
I see what it is.

888
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,020
Okay.

889
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:41,020
Let me play, let me see what I do.

890
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,020
That's 40 minutes.

891
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,020
You don't play that last thing tomorrow.

892
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,020
I'm going to play one more song for you.

893
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,020
As I was perusing around the pod,

894
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,020
say he's a network.

895
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,020
I thought to myself, man,

896
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:53,020
it's been a while since we've had a little bit of love on the show.

897
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,020
Let's bring it now, brother.

898
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,020
Love and there she goes.

899
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:03,020
I'm so good to you.

900
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:08,020
What ever happened?

901
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:13,020
Don't leave me so soon.

902
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,020
So I'm so good to you.

903
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:21,020
What ever happened?

904
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:24,020
Don't leave me so soon.

905
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:31,020
It's alright when it's okay.

906
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,020
Yeah.

907
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,020
Yeah.

908
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,020
Yeah.

909
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,020
Yeah.

910
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,020
Yeah.

911
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,020
Yeah.

912
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,020
Yeah.

913
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,020
Yeah.

914
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,020
Yeah.

915
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,020
Yeah.

916
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,020
Yeah.

917
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,020
Yeah.

918
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,020
Yeah.

919
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,020
Yeah.

920
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,020
Yeah.

921
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,020
Yeah.

922
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,020
Yeah.

923
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,020
Yeah.

924
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,020
Yeah.

925
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,020
Yeah.

926
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,020
Yeah.

927
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,020
Yeah.

928
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,020
Yeah.

929
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,020
It's just.

930
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,020
I can't win.

931
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,020
So, very minutes.

932
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,020
First and second kamera.

933
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,020
Then, you say you can't.

934
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:09,020
Take pictures.

935
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,020
My name is Fernando Carret and I'm the lead Bro.

936
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:15,020
I'm most beat off it here so I gotta decide instead.

937
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,020
Whoo!

938
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:19,020
Leave me, man.

939
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,020
ampness.

940
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,260
Guns are gay, yeah

941
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:26,460
When she goes, no one knows

942
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,100
A lot of men she's better

943
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:35,580
Can I sing now that she'll be back again?

944
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,380
This goes, this goes

945
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:42,940
When she goes, I get it

946
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,020
It's a stage

947
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,740
She died to tell the story

948
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:01,900
Oh, she died to tell the story is the story is the story

949
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,940
It's just a kid in my head, and I'm gonna love your dad

950
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,940
We're out of birth, right?

951
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:14,140
No, I don't wanna be a loom, I don't wanna be a loom, I don't wanna be your brother, I'm gonna tell you

952
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:17,100
Just that guy, we'll go outside

953
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,260
I know where we're gonna be

954
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,060
Yeah, I know, yeah, I'm in to

955
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,860
I can't breathe to everything

956
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,980
It's a treasure, I wanna be the guy

957
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,700
The girl's walking through the mirror

958
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,860
Oh, I'm so bad

959
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:34,460
Oh, he's crazy to read

960
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,900
Like I thought I'd get it getting

961
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,900
Just spread all your time

962
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:40,940
For those not up for this

963
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,380
But no real lies

964
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:46,460
Oh, this goes, this goes, this

965
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,720
Busico's a doubly

966
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,380
Ghost crazy on a know

967
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,180
Oh, let's see it's though

968
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,900
And as I see it though

969
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,500
Don't know, stupid back up next

970
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,160
There's a ghost, this ghost

971
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,500
With possiamo's a kill

972
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:14,340
And I get the light live

973
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:44,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

974
00:45:44,340 --> 00:46:14,340
Nooooo, wooivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviviv

975
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:31,380
There she goes from the album of the year, find it at the Podsat Music Network.

976
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:37,300
If you're a podcaster and you want to play Podsat Music Register at music.podshow.com.

977
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:41,940
And there was something in that song that created yet another community test here for source

978
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:48,260
code listeners. When Brother Love said, I'm left, I'm right, and now I'm center stage.

979
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:54,740
In my headphones, it was reversed. So I don't know if I have something messed up here,

980
00:46:54,740 --> 00:47:00,180
or I'm sure the Brother Love didn't mess it up. Let me know and check your ear buds.

981
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,940
Make sure you have, let me see, is this left and right? Hold on, let me see. It doesn't actually

982
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:10,180
say, hmm. I'm pretty sure that he's headphone that I have him on the right way, but I don't know.

983
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:14,340
I'll have to listen to my own ear buds. Hey everybody, that's it for today. I'll be back tomorrow.

984
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:18,420
We're going to do the hump day edition of the show. I think we got some Trinity coming up

985
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:25,700
and more good music. Good times. Good fun. There we go. Thanks, everybody.
