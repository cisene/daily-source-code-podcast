1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 346

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
$16 million worth of airplane strapped my ass

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You've seen the video!

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Somebody told me you're a San Francisco

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
They said you're working in a box and you become

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Somebody told me that you're not on top of the world

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You probably walkin down the street with your earbuds

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Jam so deep in your ear, yeah you're going down

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You probably found this little MP3 for free

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We've been playing this, but not on the radio made this

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Just so I could let it go, there's anyone around here

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Still have a radio, and he won't hear at all

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Anyone here at all

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You should go and see him out in a cool bird scene

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's way cooler out there, yeah I think so

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But maybe you just like it in your cozy little world

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You can play this, but not on the radio made this

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Just so I could let it go, there's anyone around here

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Still have a radio, and he won't hear at all

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Anyone here at all

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Maybe I'm just good to what you say

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Maybe I'm from my hell, maybe I just like it if you

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Turn it off now, turn it off now

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Don't forget about us, I'm real in West Virginia

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We can make it on our own, and we'll do it just fine

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I can't afford here at good, but it's outside

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We can play this, but not on the radio made this

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But not on the radio, hey now, switch off your radio

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But on the radio, we can play this, but not on the radio made this

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Just so I could let it go, there's anyone around here

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Still have a radio, anyone here at all

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Anyone here at all

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Anyone here at all

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Jeff Smith, changing the music business before your very eyes

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Not on the radio, perfect Friday song, you saw the

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Stupid mixer, you saw the video, yesterday on the very first

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Victor Mike Charlie, the video music cast, which I did

40
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Had a lot of fun doing that, it's been a while since I've

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Messed around with video editing programs, last time was during our

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Reality show, so I'm used to looking at different things, mainly high

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Quality, and of course when we're looking at smaller screens

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's a little less critical, learn an incredible amount

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
First of all, man, just to put together a seven minute video

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Two hours, everything all combined, that's a lot of work

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's more work than a podcast

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I used I'm movie, of course I love the Mac for video editing

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It does very well, audio editing as well

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Still using cast blaster as my playout system for recording the show

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Lots of feedback, first of all, it seems like it struck a chord with just about everybody

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I think that Jeff and his family did such an incredible job on that video

53
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And the song, it's just, it's a hit, you know, here's a guy who doesn't have a record

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He has a record coming out, you know, which will be a collection of just, he has tons of songs in the

55
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Podsave music network, he's the guy behind the Metro sexual moment

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Which we'll hear later today, Trinity, Roger Smalls, and even sent me a little surprise

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Which I'll share with you in just a bit

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This is great, you know, I was listening to that whole music conference that I pointed out on

59
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Curry.com yesterday and I'm going to just have to do a whole separate show about it

60
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I want to have a couple of artists, so I maybe just do our own little round table and have a conversation about this stuff

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Because I heard so many things that I agreed with and so many things

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I strongly disagree with and there were some things that were just completely overlooked

63
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The number one interesting point I thought of that entire discussion is the podcast hotel

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Which I'm sorry, I couldn't be at it. It sounds like it was going to be great

65
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I think they're coming to San Francisco soon, so I hope to make that one

66
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You know, everyone kind of glossed over the PROs, you know, the performing rights organizations like ASCAP BMI

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And that's really where the the problem for podcasters start and there was so little conversation about that

68
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
There was a lot of intertwined conversation about

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Royalties about mechanical rights about distribution about sales and somewhere interwoven with that is also the performing rights

70
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Organizations who want to charge money, so it was just it was a good conversation, but man, I wish I'd been there

71
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
My bad, I just couldn't make it. Okay, so back to the video for a second

72
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Besides all these great comments from everybody

73
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
There were some some negative comments and which was to be expected. I'm a glad I got them

74
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And it was really surrounding the choice of format. I basically just, you know, took eye movie and you know, there's an expert export option and there was iPod

75
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So I just selected iPod of course

76
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Who is it Chris Taylor was one of the many people to point out that you know, this is H264

77
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Codec and it's only slightly more useless than windows media video

78
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And he makes several suggestions

79
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Let's see the suggestions he says that will work on as many devices as possible is either divix

80
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I have to beg to differ on the divix because that won't play out of the box on a quick time player

81
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Exivid MP1 MP2

82
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Or if you want direct iPod support MP4, so not the M4 V I guess. Okay, so on the next

83
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Victor Mike Charlie L. I'll make sure I do a better job of choosing the format

84
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I totally agree with that by the way and there's lots to discuss about

85
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
About digital rights management, but really about formats and and lock-in

86
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Gosh, I never thought we'd have to have this conversation, but it is definitely coming

87
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We have to be very very careful and support MP3 to the max as much as we can and continue to support it

88
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And be very well we'll get to that later on. This got there so much. This is going to be a long show

89
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Probably already seen in your in your podcast catcher or iTunes whatever you're using or maybe just in a quick time player or real real player

90
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I mean this this thing will play and everything right you probably seem to long show, but it's jam pack of excellent feedback

91
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Two pieces about the flicker trial

92
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Again for people who are following this March 9th which is next what Wednesday Thursday

93
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Is when we get the judgment and we find out how we did again two pieces to this case one is

94
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The theft of my pictures from flicker which we're listed as non commercial use only in the creative comments on the flicker site

95
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
They said that they they said that the line you know this picture is public meant to them that they could use it and publish it for profit

96
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And the other one is endangerment of my child

97
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So two pieces of feedback on that now

98
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And then can you tell us your one time listening to the first time listening to your feedback

99
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I've been listening with a lot of interest to the upcoming trial or loss of their

100
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You've filed with this tabloid that's misused or ripped off your flicker images

101
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And it occurred to me when you're talking the other day about how they had used the word public as their excuse for it

102
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But you didn't mention anything regarding the virus terms service

103
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So we're not there had a look at their site and or super purchased by Yahoo this is no Yahoo services service

104
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There's actually some notes up there if you have a look regarding copywriting or contacting the copyright agent if any misuse of materials is occurring on their site

105
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Or I think from their site as well

106
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So perhaps a nice kind of season the sister from them or something at least backing up that word public

107
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Can't be interpreted in that way from you know a big mega corporation

108
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Anyway, hope that helps. Good luck with their lawsuit love your show

109
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You can check out my blog at www.gamebasekey.com

110
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Dude don't record those in the while you're washing doing your laundry. Okay. It doesn't help the sound quality

111
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Okay, so I'm pretty sure that will win the you know, but that will will be ruled in our favor about the the theft of the pictures the question of courses

112
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You know, so what are the damages and we went through this on previous Charlie's we talked about what those damages could be

113
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What we actually submitted is what we have to find out how much money they made first to determine how much of that extra profit that they made off of our pictures we want to take

114
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And we want to be on 110,000 euros as an advance on those damages

115
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But of course, you have to quantify and that well we went through that whole discussion of what is a picture worth according to the magazine a picture published on the internet is worth nothing

116
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So if let's say the judge rules against me against us

117
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:59,000
In that particular instance, well, then of course, I'm going to take it as far as I can go because that is very important for the internet in general and for the millions of flicker users

118
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And we know the guys at Yahoo, so I'm sure that won't be a problem to to get into the right places there and have them make a statement about it

119
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So we'll just have to see

120
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It never ceases to amaze me what kind of people listen to this show. I love it. I really do all kinds of ages, all kinds of vocations

121
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And when you get into legal matters, you know it, even I have lawyers listening

122
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Hello, do you have a lawyer here?

123
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Hey Adam, this is Todd from the Jersey Todd show.

124
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
As you know, I've been a fan of the trolley for a long time and I've been extremely interested in listening to you talk about your court case

125
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
As a practicing trial lawyer, I actually think it's kind of fun to hear what your perception of what happened at your recent hearing

126
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You see, there are a lot of times when I listen to other podcasts and I feel like I'm completely on the outside

127
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm not a radio or entertainment guy, my show doesn't have crazy production

128
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I know nothing about computers to be as real

129
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And you know, I really don't know anybody in the entertainment industry to name drop

130
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
However, when you start talking about trial law, well now you're in my dog pound

131
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Uh-huh, first let me say I know nothing about the Dutch legal system or its legal community

132
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I did spend a fun night at the Bulldog and Amsterdam before law school

133
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But more on point, I'm pretty amazed on how fast your claim had gotten to a hearing

134
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
In the US something like this would have really taken years before there's any kind of substantive decision

135
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So if everyone had already agreed to the facts, I actually think that it's pretty cool that it moved along like it did

136
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Well, let me just address that for a second first of all, dude

137
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Next time you go to the Bulldog call me, I'll make sure you get something from the special menu

138
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Um, second

139
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Uh, so the main differences with the Dutch court and please really think about this

140
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
We have no jury system, there's no jury to address

141
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Only professional judges and when they run out of judges because the courts are busy which happens all the time

142
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Then they revert to back up judges who are lawyers who work at commercial law firms

143
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So I think that's a difficult system to comprehend coming from

144
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Coming from the US and of course the UK has a similar system to the US

145
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Um, we requested a special procedure called the Court Hadding which means a short procedure

146
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Brilliant and you can do that in certain instances and the reason we saw this procedure and the reason it was granted to us was because

147
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
There was endangerment to our child the magazine doesn't just stay on the rack

148
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You know, just it isn't available only for that week, you know, it winds up in something

149
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
In Holland, they have something very interesting. It's called the lace mappa

150
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And essentially for a reduced fee you can buy a bundle you can rent a bundle of magazines

151
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Which are second hand and so a week after all magazines are published they get they get bought up by these

152
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Uh, by these distributors who distribute these collections of magazines

153
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And so you'll pay maybe, you know, let's just say 10 bucks a month or whatever and every week

154
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You'll get your package of magazines and then at the end of the month or the end of the week

155
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You put them back in their folder and the guy picks it up gives you the new one

156
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And that one gets passed on to the next family who's going to read that for a price of maybe six euros

157
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And it goes on so down the line until the magazine is pretty much been spent after eight to ten weeks

158
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And then it winds up in the

159
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
In the barber shop in the hair salon

160
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Which was funny because the judge actually said that she believed that these magazines didn't show up in her hair salon

161
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And my lawyer is one of my lawyers bald

162
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So I said well, you know, I think we should stop about here because we're way unbalanced on this side of the table

163
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Anyway

164
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So

165
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Because there was endangerment of the child

166
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And we requested a recall of these magazines to get them out of these collections

167
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
They gave us, you know, this court time in a short time frame

168
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Which still was more than, you know, almost three weeks from when we started to file all this stuff now

169
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Just going back to the previous comment, of course we sent a cease and desist and demand letter before we took him to court

170
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But that's when those guys came back and said, oh well, yeah, maybe we did take your pictures

171
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Well, here's 1500 bucks, you know, you should just take that and be happy and shut up

172
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Okay, let's move on

173
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
In the US, I guess we call a motion for summary judgment where there are no material facts and dispute

174
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And it's just a question of law

175
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
In that situation a judge can decide the matter on a motion from either party

176
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And that motion would be dispositive of the whole case

177
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
However, I think that there are some things that are universal to trial law

178
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Regardless of if it happens in Dutch court or in the US court

179
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And there are some universal things to having a client and being a lawyer

180
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So Adam, as a former law clerk to a superior court judge, a former deputy attorney general

181
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And a current ambulance, Chaser carrying all of the 300 active litigation files

182
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Would you care to join me on a tour behind the scenes?

183
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Take me there, buddy

184
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
First, the judge could care less whether or not you had your green contacts in, your blue contacts in

185
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Or whether or not your hair was nice

186
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The judge has seen a lot worse and a lot better than you

187
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Oh, I totally disagree, first of all, I revert back to the fact that these are professional judges

188
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So you always want to be at your best

189
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I think by the way, the fact that the defendant, the editor in chief Mark von The Linde

190
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Who said he couldn't come because he fell down in less skiing and hurt his knee

191
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And of course, the same night he was on television, via phone

192
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It was not in person but via phone

193
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Even saying that, oh, my knee is much better

194
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And the curries are horrible parents and all kinds of nasty things

195
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That does not bode well

196
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I know I've been through these procedures before where

197
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The defendant did not show up and the judge's a little, he said, well, he doesn't seem to think it's important

198
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It does matter, it really, really, really does matter in the Dutch court certainly with celebrity

199
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It matters because people are influenced, you know, this judge knows who I am

200
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
She knows who my wife is, she has preconceived notions

201
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And I have to, you know, she may think, I'm an ambulance chair

202
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So dude, then I'm just trying, you know, I had to say things like, hey, in the 20 years we've been married

203
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And we've been together and in the public eye we've never sued a gossip magazine for anything

204
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That she does not know

205
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So I disagree and I think that it does make a difference and being respectful and

206
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Both to the court, to the judge and to the process I think is really important

207
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And with that comes dress code

208
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
There's a reason why lawyers have to wear this, you know, in Holland, the lawyers have, they don't have to wear the wigs like they do in the UK

209
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But they wear a black dress with a, you know, white little thingy mobabi

210
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So there's dress code, you know, so with that comes blue contact lenses

211
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
In fact, I always remind clients about their non-verbal communication with the court

212
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The judge saw everything that went on from the moment you and your adversary walked in the door

213
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So unless your name is Anna Nicole Smith, it really didn't matter how you look

214
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Well, dude, the judge was female, okay, so I think Anna Nicole Smith would not have been advantages

215
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But she was female, somewhere between my age and Patricia's age

216
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And I think it does make a matter, it matters difference, make it whatever

217
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Dude, I think the judge asked you a fair question when she asked what exactly is the remedy here

218
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Remember, criminal courts are set up to punish, where civil courts are set up to make an injured party whole

219
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
As I've said on my podcast and and basically to anybody that will listen

220
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The R I double A has been pulling a fast one on everyone

221
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yeah, the damages that they are seeking in cases where they're seeking like 150 large

222
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's ridiculous because they've already set the market price of 99 cents per song

223
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
This is exactly what I told the judge and and this it came at exactly the right moment

224
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Where she was taking a fence while taking a fence, she was questioning my use of words like theft and and you know

225
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
A huge disservice to intellectual property at large

226
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You know I said hey man, it's the same words that the R I A a uses and what is their song worth 99 cents

227
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So what's my picture worth?

228
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Okay, let's see what else you have to say about that so in those cases if somebody were to swipe a song or even a hundred songs

229
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The basis for damages should only be 99 cents

230
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Now I'm not saying if that somebody was a distributor of of you know unlicensed music and they're you know putting up their own network and distributing it to a lot of people

231
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Yeah, I think those people should be punished and I think that punitive damages would be appropriate

232
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But to the average person who swipes a song the value of a song is 99 cents

233
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But that's that's a discussion for another day

234
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Okay, I mean other one of these things these five minute comments another day

235
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Sure, what amount of money will make you feel better about what happened in the situation?

236
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
All the court ultimately has jurisdiction over

237
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Is maybe the judge can have them write a retraction maybe an apology and the judge will ultimately award you money

238
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But as far as the judge ordering someone to be fired or amagging to be put at it

239
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Hold on a second. I never asked that the court to fire him when these guys offered me 1500 euros

240
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I said you know what he is my counter offer my counter offer is I didn't say fire him I said

241
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You know dismiss him from his function as chief editor and that'll send a strong message to the other chief editors

242
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:32,000
That they just have to watch their peas and cubes. I didn't say fire him. That was my counter offer. They should have taken it because now I'm going to crush them like a little bug

243
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Or even for them to provide you free cases of sensial for the rest of your life and ain't gonna happen

244
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So you may have put so much pressure on the magazine internally that they may have to choose to fire someone that was involved with this situation

245
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
But certainly what this is accomplished is that they're gonna get a lump of coal in their stocking the next time their Christmas bonus comes around

246
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yeah, that is actually true. I know that for a fact and that is one of the main motivators is I know that the publisher outducks owned by a reformed family in the Netherlands who clearly support non-family values have no morals

247
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I know that they sent when they hired this guy they said and whatever you do no lawsuits

248
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So that's why this guy is all freaked out is because I'm attacking him personally

249
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm putting their magazine in the shady light that it belongs currently they can change

250
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
So they probably will get a lump of coal, but again, and I extend this offer

251
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And I know they listen because they have transcripts of this show transcripts of the show calling me a drug user

252
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Okay, so they said some things that were true

253
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Transcripts of the show they listen to it again

254
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
We can drop the whole thing if you say that you were wrong and you are removing this guy from his position as editor and chief

255
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That's it then we're all done then and and I will start out to drop everything. It's that simple it is that simple and believe me

256
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Just like you guys, I have enough money to continue the fight

257
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Particularly because it's personal as well

258
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Third, here's the one that's going to blow you away

259
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Generally, I think the judge knew exactly what direction she was going to go in before you or any of the lawyers walked into the court

260
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I spent an entire year researching and writing decisions for a brilliant judge here in New Jersey

261
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And most of the time he would push me to find research to back up what he was thinking

262
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And we would just go out and on the bench to confirm everything

263
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Sometimes I knew exactly the way he would rule and write it up the right way before he even told me to

264
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Look my boss is a former newer cop that became a judge

265
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
If I goofed it up he'd have me doing pushups in the hallway

266
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But my point is at him that the judge knew exactly what way she wanted to go and really was just looking for justification

267
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
When I go up to the belt of vision or I have to do with a panel of judges

268
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I generally can tell whether or not I'm screwed

269
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So this really brings me to my last point. Wait before you get there. Okay

270
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I agree with you

271
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I think this judge did have a preconceived notion as to what the suit about and how it was going to work and how it was going to fit together

272
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And I think that I was prepared for that and then I almost automatically gravitated towards explaining what this was really about

273
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And why I was here and why I was taking my time away from my family, from my job, from my colleagues, from my art, from my fun

274
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
From my country

275
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And I think that that was you know, that's when I got to the tipping point and hopefully I was able to convince her that this was about something else

276
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Then she came in with so I do agree with you there

277
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But I'm very happy that she appeared open-minded and really opened up to what I was trying to communicate

278
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And there comes a point in every lawyer's career where they've reached that old crap moment

279
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Over the years I've represented many, many clients that have chosen to use my voice in my time in a way that makes me absolutely no sense to me

280
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And absolutely has no basis in reality

281
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I still got a couple of files like that

282
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I mean, I've had files so bad that they bark when I walk into court

283
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And I think the position that the lawyers are in for the magazine are really in that old crap moment

284
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yeah, no, I agree with you there on the old crap moment

285
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
This guy was totally befuddled and flustered, didn't know how the internet worked

286
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
The magazine doesn't know how the internet works

287
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And if you're listening to this podcast on serious stars 103, I invite you to come back to Monday for more source code or go to dailysourceco.com to download the rest of this great conversation

288
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Okay, they're gone, let's continue

289
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
There are attorneys certainly sound like they are and I kind of feel bad for them

290
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
They've been putting that position like a train seal and now we're just trying to bark like a lawyer

291
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I mean, I'm not into making predictions or anything, but it sounds like the hearing itself went well

292
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I guess it really depends on what remedies are available to the judge if she were to find your way, which it sounds like she's going to

293
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Now, it certainly sounds like she has all the ammunition she needs and it'll be fun to see what she does

294
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Now, I can't send you a bill for this point two of billable time

295
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
However, considering how cheap my rates are, let's just say we can settle up in one special DSC way

296
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
A promo

297
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Hold on a second, my brother

298
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Your promo as I see here is going to last 26 seconds

299
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I'm sorry, you clearly have my rates confused with your rates

300
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Uh-uh, Jersey Todd

301
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Um, you owe me another three comments at least

302
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
That's right, come on, you Charlie heads

303
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
When you're done listening to the chat chat, come on over to the Jersey Todd Show at www.jutotshow.com

304
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And check out my show where I play some of the best unheard podsafe music and go off on some pretty good rants myself

305
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I don't add them since I'm not a pilot, I can't say tailwinds, but I have never get into boat once or twice around Jersey

306
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So all I can say is keep you right on the right returning

307
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And well, now back to your regularly scheduled Charlie

308
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Thanks buddy, the chat chat, okay, so I'll I'll take off one audio comment

309
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You'll only only two more fantastic really appreciate the feedback dude

310
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's good to it's funny how that works isn't it how you send in this audio comment

311
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And I can actually have the conversation with you, I don't know

312
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Somehow it just works

313
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yesterday I had quite a rant about the EFF

314
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Talking about John Perry Barlow and Cory Doctro

315
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And I guess the Charlie's reaching far and wide now

316
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Because on previous things like the podsafe music network terms he didn't hear

317
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
But now people are passing stuff on to him and that's cool

318
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
So the reach is spreading out like an ugly ass oil stain

319
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And Cory fired me back in email

320
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And I asked him if he would put it into an audio comment which he did and I really appreciate it

321
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Let's listen to his feedback which is very interesting

322
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
On the inside workings of the electronic frontier foundation

323
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Hi Adam, it's Cory Doctro

324
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Someone just forwarded me a piece from one of your recent podcasts

325
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And you were talking about what EFF doesn't do

326
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I don't work for EFF anymore, I haven't since the New Year

327
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
But I thought I would clarify a little what it is EFF doesn't do

328
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Just from an inside perspective

329
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I understand I'm not really speaking for EFF here

330
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I don't work for them anymore

331
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
But I do think I have a pretty good sense of some of the process that goes into choosing cases

332
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
EFF's got a bunch of different briefs

333
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It's got a lobbying side, it's got an activist in campaigning side

334
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And it's got a legal side

335
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
The legal side gets a lot of requests for legal help

336
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
But it only takes on a small number of those

337
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It's because EFF's legal strategy is impact litigation

338
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
That means taking on court cases that set or break precedence in the US legal system

339
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So that means EFF doesn't defend individuals

340
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
whose cases aren't going to set a binding precedent by and large

341
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I think they're probably been exceptions

342
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
But EFF isn't a legal defense clinic

343
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It has a list of cooperating attorneys

344
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
These are attorneys who sue or defend people on a low-cost or pro-bono basis

345
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And the legal intake staff at EFF circulates cases that EFF can't take to those people

346
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Sometimes EFF helps out with those people as well

347
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Giving them expert advice and amicus briefs and so on

348
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
EFF is an impact litigation organization

349
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Which means that it chooses the cases that turn its members donations

350
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Into the largest impact on the laws that will govern the internet as possible

351
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
There really aren't enough donations in the world to defend every individual who gets bone by the system

352
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
But if you pick the right case, you can win precedence that affect millions of individuals

353
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
For example, when EFF won the Bernstein case and legalized crypto

354
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It was nice to have defended Dan Bernstein

355
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
He was a mathematician who was getting a shot from the feds

356
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
But the important outcome wasn't that Dan got to publish

357
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It was everyone's right to use crypto that came as a result of this

358
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
That's enabled every commerce transactions taking place on the web since

359
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Not to mention all the Chinese dissidents and others who benefited from access to privacy technology

360
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Okay, hold on one second. I just got a jump in here

361
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So, understood

362
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And I know a little bit more about the EFF

363
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So here's what appears to me

364
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
First of all, the curry versus MTV networks lawsuit is pointed to

365
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
In the legal community as jurisprudence

366
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It was the first

367
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
That I'm aware of the first large-scale domain name dispute

368
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And I think even reference by EFF as a case that provides jurisprudence

369
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
So I think and this is really my feeling about the EFF

370
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It's not about anyone personally but just the EFF and it's an organization

371
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And often any type of organization that defends you or helps you

372
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
There's always going to be people who fall on the edges

373
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I feel that I do fall on the edge

374
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So the review process of what can be jurisprudence

375
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I don't see how a lawsuit between MTV networks and an individual

376
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Over domain name

377
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Which involves a brand and a trademark and you know possible

378
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Random act complications or references

379
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Maybe I'm not a lawyer

380
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
You know I can't see how that is not a

381
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
A case that would be interesting to the EFF

382
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
What I think instead happened was they said oh it's the MTV guy

383
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
It's MTV and it's some dispute something else

384
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And I didn't look into it and wouldn't listen to the story

385
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Now granted when I met John Perry Barlow and discussed this

386
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You're both pretty stunned so maybe I didn't communicate very well

387
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I certainly didn't send off any letter to anyone

388
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I just thought he would be able to communicate

389
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
He seemed to understand at the time but of course we were understanding lots of stuff at the time

390
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So I think there is kind of a double standard

391
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It seems like EFF always wants to come up for the little guy

392
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
As long as he's a scientist, a mathematician, a student

393
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Someone who has no apparent financial means to bring a suit themselves

394
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And I think that's an overestimation of what celebrities might be able to afford

395
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Or people who, yeah the celebrities in general

396
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
When you see someone who's certainly in the 90's still

397
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
If you had to take celebrities and we know that celebrities can be total losers from some reality show

398
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Maybe I am just a total loser for some reality show

399
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I think there is a double standard there and that people are judged

400
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Not by what the importance of their case

401
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
But often just by appearances

402
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
It's a very human thing but I think the review process of which cases are taken on

403
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Should be looked at. Let's just continue because Corey has some more

404
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
And by the way this is I love this

405
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And Corey wanted everyone to know up front that he has some kind of weird thing with his microphone

406
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
He's aware of it and we couldn't get it fixed

407
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It doesn't bother me so let's listen to some more of Corey Doctoro

408
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I don't really know the specifics of either the MTV case

409
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Or the current case you've got involving your flicker photo

410
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And I'm not a lawyer so I can't really comment on the moment

411
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
In any depth.

412
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Hold on. I don't think that you're looking Corey

413
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I think you should know this

414
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Isn't this the kind of stuff you write about?

415
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Isn't that what you do on boy and boy?

416
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Yeah we get all the funny stories

417
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Isn't this an important one as well?

418
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Yeah a magazine taking pictures off of flicker

419
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Even though they have the creative comments license which you advocate so much

420
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
This is important you should know about this stuff

421
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You know this I think is exactly the stuff that you should be involved

422
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And whether you have anything to do with the EFF or not

423
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Or some insight into the calculus that goes into EFF choosing the case

424
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And the right thing to do there isn't to look at whether or not EFF is on your side

425
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But whether winning for your side creates lasting overarching changes in the league

426
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Okay so there you go. I think that winning and beating out

427
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Violators of the creative commons license

428
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Who are probably going to get away with just a slap on the wrist

429
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I think could be something that would have jurisprudence

430
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
No system which is EFF's brief

431
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Some considerations to figure out whether that's the case

432
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Well if cases are fact intensive and likely to require a jury

433
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
EFF isn't likely to take them because juries don't make binding precedent

434
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Well that's great because we have no juries in this case

435
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
We can check that box. There we go

436
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Decision that a jury hands down

437
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Doesn't necessarily get honored by the next jury or the next court

438
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
If a case hinges on areas of law that are settled

439
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Where it's been proven out that the law's constitutional as bad as it is

440
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It's unlikely EFF's going to take it

441
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Because in that case the only way you can change that law is to actually get a new law passed

442
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And EFF will likely be working with other organizations on the hill

443
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
That work to introduce new laws and overturn old ones using non litigation strategies

444
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Okay, so in this case then obviously EFF couldn't help me because it's only for the United States

445
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And not for any other countries. Okay got it

446
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And finally if a case is likely to be settled out of court

447
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Chances are EFF won't be interested in taking it because of course

448
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
If you settled not a court you don't make a precedent

449
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Okay, and of course I have said that I would set a lot of court

450
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
But I would lovingly take that back if I had you know all the help in the world of big intelligence smart

451
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You know organizations like EFF so I you know doesn't this is not about money

452
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,000
It really isn't it's about where are the boundaries for the little guy when it comes to intellectual property theft

453
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And where are the boundaries of endangerment of a child which is not really EFF's mantra I understand that

454
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
None of this is hidden or obscure by EFF

455
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
But it is a pretty subtle point and I think a lot of people who aren't experts in this kind of activism miss it

456
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I certainly wasn't really clear on it until I started working for the organization

457
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
None of this is because EFF doesn't want justice for individuals

458
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
EFF is an impact litigation organization and it tries to turn small donations into big wins

459
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And that means hard by hard done by individual sometimes don't get help by the organization

460
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But EFF's cooperating attorneys list is very large and often does find counsel for those who need it

461
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
EFF does have a commitment to justice for as many people as it can manage

462
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:51,000
But as I say the only way that it can choose how to prioritize is on which bang will be the biggest one for its litigation bucks are more importantly

463
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
The litigation bucks that people like you and me have donated to them

464
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,000
So I hope that clarifies things I'll just mention in closing that is Barlow is still involved with the organization has been

465
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Since the founding as far as I know he was a founder and he's still on the board of work and a board of directors

466
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I think he's been on a continuous lay. I'm maybe he's taken a year off here or there

467
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Does he still have that awesome bud? He's been around for 16 years

468
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And I'm pretty proud and pleased to call him a friend

469
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
So I hope that was helpful. Thanks a lot. Have a great day.

470
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
No, Cory, thank you very much. I really appreciate it and

471
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Dude, official friend of the Charlie come on back anytime you want, send it an audio comment about anything

472
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And shoot, I'll even ask Jeff Smith to make up a little jingle for you

473
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Oh man, this is going to be a long one, but there's so much good stuff still to come

474
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I hope you don't you know that take your finger off of that fast forward button don't do that

475
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Podcast 4 on one this week featuring Michael Butler the rock and roll geek show a lot of ass kissing my way

476
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
But a pretty good show. Make sure you catch it.

477
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Hey Adam, this is Mark from zero gravity radio in Kansas City, Missouri

478
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And I proclaim this weekend to be a pod save music weekend

479
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Matthew evil and Laura clap

480
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,000
We'll be performing at club in the talk on the third and the fourth of March

481
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
That's Friday and Saturday at eight o'clock

482
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And the address to Barbara Natasha is 1911 Main Street in Kansas City, Missouri

483
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Phone number down there if you need directions is 816-472-533

484
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And I hope to get everybody from Kansas City to come down in support

485
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Matthew and Laura and pod save music down at Barbara Natasha

486
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Fill the place up and it'll be a blast and Adam

487
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
You wish you were here with us

488
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Oh man, let me tell you if I was in San Francisco this weekend

489
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I would have gotten on a plane to come to see this show

490
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Just to hang out with that group of people that sounds so awesome

491
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Laura clap might the new love of my life are you kidding me?

492
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
And then lighter flicking

493
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Oh man, it's not that being here at the cottage is bad by the way

494
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Patricia and I have some nasty stuff planned for this weekend

495
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Speaking of nasty

496
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Adam, it's Angie, long time to see

497
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
So love spirals are starting to book some shows and support of our new CD

498
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And I was thinking how cool it would be to have a pod safe music network

499
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Presents Love Spiral Show with say a few other payment-related bands in our style

500
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
We'd love to play in San Fran, man

501
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And it'd be fun to do intimate performance at pod your headquarters as well

502
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
So let's chat about the possibilities

503
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I got some intimate performance ideas at the headquarters, baby

504
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You know what, this is a good idea, I'll get the pod pump on it

505
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And Michael Butler

506
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And I don't know if we can do it this month

507
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I don't know when you're planning your dates

508
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
But let's see if we can work some out

509
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I mean if we can find a venue and by the way, Rosie

510
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
At pod show HQ she's so tied into the San Francisco scene

511
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
She'll be able to help with ideas

512
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And yeah, be great if we could do it, be great

513
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And I'm sure that if we need to come up with a little budget to help support it

514
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I'm sure we can work something out

515
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I was gonna say something and I saved this

516
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Patrick Bouse says, hi Adam, first of all great show

517
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I'm listening to it now for a year, 11 every minute of it

518
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
As a San Seo customer, yeah, this is a Blumenal Adverts work

519
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm registered to the San Seo newsletter

520
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And today I got one which is pretty interesting

521
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Pickwick comes out now with a tea pad for the San Seo machine

522
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Because you like the San Seo

523
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And you like to drink tea, I thought this was worth a mention

524
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
PickwickT.com, the tea pads

525
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Sounds kind of nasty, doesn't sounds like a sanitary nap

526
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Can talk about marketing

527
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Okay, thanks buddy, really appreciate it

528
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Let me just put that up there

529
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So we know that I talked about that there in the show notes

530
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I wonder though, you know, if you have the coffee comes out

531
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I mean, wouldn't the tea water, the actual tea mixture

532
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Come out of the same spigot as the coffee

533
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And won't you taste that?

534
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I mean, there's nothing worse in the world when you're in a hotel

535
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And you order tea and they bring it up in a pot

536
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
At one point contained coffee because you can just taste it

537
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It is horrible, I mean, I've had this at the best hotels in the world

538
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And man, I've caused a shit about that

539
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Usually not to hotels in former empires of the British empire

540
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And former colonies of the British empire

541
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
A couple more pieces of Gmail feedback

542
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Stewart Davenport Adam, just like the comment on the pot's

543
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
If music network re-download function, great idea

544
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Keeping my download history, giving me the ability to get that file again

545
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Without repaying is brilliant and truly a community safe feature

546
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Whereas ample has done a half-hearted attempt

547
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
They certainly record what you've purchased

548
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
But not giving the function to re-download those tracks

549
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Feed of charge, free of charge is appalling

550
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I have sadly lost all my music on my Mac

551
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And they expect me to repay 100 pounds plus in music to get my music back

552
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Now I understand if I buy a book from a store and lose the pages in it

553
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I can take it back to the store and ask for replacement pages

554
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
But hell man, that is data

555
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I've paid for it surely, I should be able to download again

556
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
This is a joke

557
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Viva la revolution Adam says Stewart Davenport, Manchester UK

558
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Dude, thank you very much

559
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Yeah, no, and this is very concerning

560
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And I'm learning more people are sending me articles

561
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
About how this vives

562
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I mean, you know what, we have to be really careful

563
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Of these systems that have some form of sanctioned built in

564
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Like the iPod

565
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
You know, we just have to be very aware of what's going on

566
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Steve Jobs said, it is recent fun products announcement

567
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
That he feels that all your music belongs on your iPod

568
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And you take your iPod from place to place

569
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
It's on your head, you stick it in your boom box

570
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
You put it in your home, high-fi

571
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
But your music belongs there, which means

572
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
You can only get it through the combination of iPod

573
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And iTunes and there's DRM on it

574
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Which only plays on the iTunes

575
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
So you kind of get locked in

576
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
At a certain point

577
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You know, what happens if a law is passed

578
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
It says all musical content that has played on devices

579
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It has to be

580
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
You know, it has to contain DRM

581
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
It could happen

582
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
We're living in really strange times right now

583
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
What if Apple says, we really don't see any value in the MP3 format

584
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Do you really think people will defect on mouse

585
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
That's in great numbers

586
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
To other portable devices

587
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I don't think so

588
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Not yet

589
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
If we start to kick some ass

590
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And get more and more people

591
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Hooked on podcasts

592
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And boy

593
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
In hindsight, the name really isn't all that great is it

594
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
It is confusing

595
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
That does kind of suck

596
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I mean, of course, the iPod is also 78% of the mobile music market

597
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Lots of things to think about here

598
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
But be very, very careful

599
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Gabe Kangus

600
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Adam Man, it was rough

601
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
This past show with your wife

602
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I was on the train

603
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I was so frustrated

604
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I was about to get up and scream

605
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Let Adam tell his story

606
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
She would not let you talk and it drove me up the wall

607
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
She would say

608
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
The sky is red

609
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
And you would correct her by saying no baby

610
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
The sky is blue

611
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And she come back with yes

612
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
That's what I'm saying

613
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Okay, it's off my chest

614
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Gabe Ganges

615
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I'll do it

616
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Welcome to the nightmare that is my life

617
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
You know?

618
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
This is the way it's been for 20 years

619
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And I wouldn't want it any other way

620
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I really wouldn't

621
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
We're a pair, man

622
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
We are a pair

623
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Okay

624
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Those of you who have been reading along

625
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
With the message boards

626
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
With the comments on curry.com

627
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
There's been quite a lot of controversy lately

628
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Concerning a commenter

629
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Comic strip blogger

630
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
And now Comic strip blogger

631
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Is pretty abusive in his writing

632
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
And he seems pretty emotional

633
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And he does really kind of say it

634
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
As he feels it and calls it like he wants to call them

635
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
He's been really offended by me

636
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Calling him stalker

637
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And of course, you know, I consider

638
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Roger Smalls to be stalker as well

639
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But

640
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I kind of turned it around on myself

641
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And I thought, you know, how do I feel

642
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
When people call me the big-haired fag

643
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Well, that actually I love

644
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
That's probably about example

645
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
How do I feel when

646
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yeah, MTV guy

647
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Or not even a derogatory term

648
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
You know, I'd rather just be known by my name

649
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
So let me just say this

650
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I apologize for calling you a stalker

651
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Comic strip blogger

652
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Roger, I don't apologize for calling

653
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
He was stalker

654
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And I think that people really do like

655
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
To hear a contrary point of view

656
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
That it does work in comments

657
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
It really, really does

658
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
But you got to work a little bit on your social skills

659
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I think and with this, Comic strip blogger

660
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I would like to invite you to become a contributor

661
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
To the daily source code

662
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
By sending me your occasional comment

663
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Don't make them too long

664
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I have to be able to understand them

665
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And you can't get pissed off if I don't use it

666
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Because, you know, I don't believe me

667
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Believe me

668
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I do not play everything the Roger sends it

669
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Okay

670
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And

671
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
And I'm not the only one who clearly is thinking this way

672
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Comic strip blogger

673
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Because here's what the Jeff Smith did for you

674
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Comic strip

675
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Comic strip

676
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Comic strip

677
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Comic strip

678
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Comic strip

679
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Comic strip

680
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Comic strip

681
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
What is the sound of 200 episodes of the financial aid podcast?

682
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Is the sound of nine months of education financial aid

683
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Student loans, scholarships, personal finance

684
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
And how to find a job

685
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,000
The sound of 11 financial aid experts and PhDs

686
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Interviewed for their expertise

687
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It's the sound of $497 million in scholarships, grants, and free money for college

688
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Is the sound of over 500 pieces of positive music played on the air

689
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
And now it's the sound of a free iPodnet

690
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It turns music stored gift cards, or Matthew will's new album, beer, and coffee

691
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
We're giving away prizes to see you now on our 200th episode

Hello Adam and listeners to the Charlie

696
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
This is Doug K from the Conversations Network and IT Conversations

697
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And today I'm exploding with exuberance to announce the next in-person podcast academy

698
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
We've put it together with Boston University

699
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
For Friday and Saturday, April 28th and 29th 2006

700
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
We've got four half-day sessions dealing with topics that include podcasting basics

701
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
The business of podcasting and podcasting in public radio, education, the corporate world

702
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And advanced topics such as video casting, music licensing, and interview recording techniques

703
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:26,000
We've also got a great lineup of instructors this time including Dan Brickland, Paul Figiani, Tony Khan, Michael Gohagan

704
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Jake Shapiro, John Furrier, Steve Garfield, CC Chapman

705
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And myself, you can get to the complete schedule and the details at podcastacademy.org

706
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And if you register before March 15th, you'll also receive $50 off the registration fee

707
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:46,000
That means you'll get two full days of all the podcasting you can take for only $250

708
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Those dates again are Friday and Saturday, April 28th and 29th at Boston University

709
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And that's podcastacademy.org for more info

710
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Thanks Adam and of course, Tailwinds

711
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Hello Adam, this is Tokyo Dan from What's Happening and Tokyo Podcast

712
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I'd like to thank you for playing my promos on the Charlie

713
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
But to get to the point after two things I want to ask you about

714
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
First is about the Podsafe Music Network

715
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I noticed that it's easy for someone in Japan to buy tunes

716
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
But how about the other way around?

717
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Will it be easy for artists in Japan to sell their tunes?

718
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
After digging around in the clicking by website

719
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I noticed that it's mostly for North American and European countries

720
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
There's nothing about Japan

721
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,000
And I'm a bit concerned about this because I've convinced a few independent Japanese artists

722
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
To put their songs on the Podsafe Music Network

723
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Well, they're happy with the international exposure they're getting

724
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,000
But when they are finally able to sell their songs on the Podsafe Music Network

725
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Will they be able to get paid?

726
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
And since they're in Japan and have Japanese bank accounts and credit cards

727
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Will they be able to receive the money that people pay for their songs

728
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Without suffering the fees imposed on international bank transfers

729
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I was wondering if you could shed a little light on how this is all going to work

730
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:11,000
The second thing I want to ask is, do you have any plans about expanding to Japan?

731
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Well, I love what you and Pods you are doing

732
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And I'd sure love to be a part of it

733
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Perhaps something like an evangelist?

734
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Heck, I'm already doing it

735
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I'd be happy to go around to the local gindies artists

736
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
That's what I call the Japanese independent artists

737
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
And put the word out about the Podsafe Music Network

738
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
In the live music clubs and private recording studios over here

739
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
If you ever need someone over here, I'd appreciate it if you kept me in mind

740
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Well, keep up the revolution, man

741
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
It's really great

742
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Alright, my brother

743
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
To answer your first question, very good one

744
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Now, you will not be receiving money from clicking by

745
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
God, now I don't even know that for sure

746
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I don't believe so

747
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
No, I think you will be receiving checks

748
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
That at least the administration will be done by Pod Show

749
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
This is one of the big things that we're working on before we actually do this

750
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Because there are other questions like, you know, when do we cut a check

751
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
For every 99 cents or is it for every 10 bucks?

752
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
You know, those kinds of questions

753
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Unfortunately, international banking does blow massive chunks

754
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Massive

755
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I mean, I've transferred millions of dollars and it just it's been gone for days

756
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Of course, I've also had it going 20 seconds

757
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
The way it should go, but you know, this all kinds of bullshit

758
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I mean, major ass bullshit going on an international banking

759
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
So we're going to do as best as possible

760
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
But look, you know, we're not bankers

761
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And we're not in the banking business

762
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
You know, as a part of the whole unlabeled concept

763
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
If there's a company

764
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
That can help us with

765
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Making payments better outside of the United States

766
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Because I agree, man, I get Amazon checks

767
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I should put my fricking senseo back on the homepage

768
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
You know, so it gets a couple hundred bucks

769
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
And to cash them, there's an exorbitant fee

770
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Exorbitant fee to cash that

771
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
You know, of course, means it should be an international bank that should honor this

772
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
But, you know, this is how these fuckers make money

773
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
What can I tell you?

774
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Second one, Japan

775
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Not actively doing anything in Japan

776
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I'll tell you the markets that we're actively looking at

777
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And by the way, that's not to say that if you have a great business plan

778
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
We don't want to work with you and form a partnership

779
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Of course we do

780
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Currently, we are actively working in the UK

781
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
In the German markets

782
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
So I'm not just saying Germany, but that includes Austria

783
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
That includes Switzerland, that includes a piece of Italy

784
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
But the German language market

785
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
There's a lot going on there

786
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Very excited about podcasting in Germany

787
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
And we actually have a team on the ground in China

788
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Yes, you heard me, China

789
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
And we've had this team on the ground for a couple months now

790
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And we're making great progress

791
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
It's very interesting

792
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Tremendous opportunity to open up

793
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Verbal and visual communication

794
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Which is very difficult to block and to fire wall

795
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And to filter out

796
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,000
You know, to start to really encourage a China breaking out

797
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
And joining in the freaking party

798
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
And of course we're building the audience here

799
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
In the west

800
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
We're going for our 100 million listeners

801
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
In the east, we're looking at 100 million tiny screens

802
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
And believe me, it's really going to happen

803
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I'm very excited about that market

804
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And what's going on

805
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
In fact, I'm planning a road trip

806
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Won't that make for a sound seeing tour

807
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Hey everybody, it's Friday

808
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I need some freaking cowbell, you know?

809
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Yes, some bass will do too

810
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Dynamite lady

811
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
On the chart

812
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
There's a way to die

813
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Can I blow me to your side

814
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I hold your name so clear loud

815
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I'm the huge show of a mine

816
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
That's right

817
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Dynamite lady

818
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Lil Taylor

819
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Dynamite lady

820
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
She'll get the whole party

821
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Dynamite lady

822
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Oh god

823
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
You

824
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I got the tip

825
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
What did you do

826
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
We had a side

827
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
What

828
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It's my ever

829
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
It's my world

830
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
It's my world

831
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
It's my world

832
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Everybody

833
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Everybody

834
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
It's the world

835
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Everybody

836
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
The moment I was never fighting for

837
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
The moment I was never fighting for

838
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
The moment I was never fighting for

839
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
The moment I was never fighting for

840
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
The moment I was never fighting for

841
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
The moment I was never fighting for

842
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
The moment I was never fighting for

843
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,000
The moment I was never fighting for

844
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,000
The moment I was never fighting for

845
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
The moment I was never fighting for

846
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:06,000
The moment I was never fighting for

847
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
The moment I was never fighting for

848
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
The moment I was never fighting for

849
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:19,000
The moment I was never fighting for

850
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
The moment I was never fighting for

851
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:54,000
And now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying, I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I

852
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm try to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm thinking I'm trying to catch this, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I'm trying to catch it, and now I

853
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,240
Uh, you know what, I'm feeling so good.

854
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,240
But here.

855
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,240
Ben, see you, Kappa.

856
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,480
She's a baby, thank you.

857
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,480
Yes, you're right.

858
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,320
You know what, you're on perfect, the timing is impeccable.

859
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,680
Because you're the dry mouth.

860
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,080
They have a very dry mouth.

861
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:37,680
Yeah.

862
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,680
You're getting front of the mic, baby.

863
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,680
So we can hear what you're saying.

864
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,680
Yeah.

865
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:45,280
So you have a very dry mouth, but that I was just about, I was just about to tell everyone

866
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,040
this is a double split show because I'm going over time and how it was just I was in a good

867
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,040
groove.

868
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,040
Oh, okay.

869
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,040
I'm going.

870
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,040
I'll leave you alone.

871
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,160
So I need, and of course, I didn't have was a cup of tea.

872
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,480
Yes, I drank my show, my show drink.

873
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,200
All righty.

874
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:00,800
Thank you, baby.

875
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,800
Love you, too.

876
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,800
Love you, too.

877
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,800
Ah.

878
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,800
That's it.

879
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,800
So that's right.

880
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:10,280
It's funny this morning, just on the split, it's just thing.

881
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:16,280
Kristy, I was trying to Christina to school and a police car was coming up behind

882
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:20,160
behind us and a couple other cars.

883
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,320
With the sirens on, I said, oh man, they're coming to get me.

884
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,040
That's the split police and she kind of got freaked out.

885
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,040
I said, no, you kidding me, right?

886
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,040
No, no, tell me it's not true.

887
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,040
No, of course it's not true.

888
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,760
I said, man, you could be like on cops and I said, and I thought about it and I said,

889
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,760
you know what?

890
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:36,080
I don't think I've ever seen anyone on cops on the show who's been arrested because

891
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:40,440
they were stoned from marijuana at least.

892
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:47,920
I've seen that either addicted to alcohol, to crack, to cocaine, poverty is usually a

893
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:53,600
big reason, just despair, but someone who's on, who's that smoked marijuana, no, you

894
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,600
don't see them.

895
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,600
I don't think.

896
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,600
I could be wrong.

897
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,600
Let me know.

898
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:02,040
Matt's from Bristol says, Adam, I went into hospital last week for a small operation.

899
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,440
Nothing too serious.

900
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,440
Thank goodness.

901
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:09,200
And we afterwards, I had to stay in overnight and got very bored with no TV, et cetera.

902
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,880
So my darling girlfriend, left me here, iPod to listen to my iPod.

903
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,400
I had loaded it up with podcasts to listen to, including the Charlie.

904
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:22,880
So once she had gone home and the doctors were leaving me alone, I plugged myself in and

905
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,400
listened to one podcast after another.

906
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,840
After a few hours, I realized that I hadn't really thought about the pain and been having

907
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,280
and was really relaxed.

908
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,280
It was great.

909
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,640
I could drift off into my own little world while listening to various podcasts just

910
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,640
rambling on.

911
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:41,640
So when short podcasting is a great pain killer, and that makes me feel very good, Matt,

912
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,640
from Bristol.

913
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,640
That's awesome.

914
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:47,000
And you know, that's what it is, man, it's the hit of the mind.

915
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,280
And you know, people can tune pain out.

916
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,240
That's what you did without even knowing it.

917
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,840
That's really, really happy to hear that.

918
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,840
That's fantastic.

919
00:57:54,840 --> 00:58:03,400
Boy, I hope you don't mind, maybe you should stop the show now and then listen to the rest

920
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,160
over the weekend or something, because we've got so much more to do.

921
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,160
I've got two more or three more comments.

922
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,760
I've got another podcast I've song I want to play for you and of course.

923
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:32,960
Okay, for the Metro section moment, this is the place where us guys come out hang out

924
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,960
together.

925
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:34,960
You can be a real man.

926
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,480
If you want, you're more than welcome, because we are real men.

927
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:41,720
We talk about the stuff that, okay, so we just don't feel comfortable talking about it.

928
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:42,720
Usually, right?

929
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,720
Not around the office, not around the locker room.

930
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:49,760
So kind of this asynchronous mode of communication, let's everyone kind of get stuff off

931
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,880
of their chest and share ideas and thoughts.

932
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,280
And it's not just us guys, the women are checking in with great regularity.

933
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,640
And I think we should listen up because they're telling us things that, I mean, at the end

934
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,720
of the day, I'll be honest, it's about getting laid, okay.

935
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:08,280
So here's Charlotte Hinton says, hey, Adam, all the way from the home of Lord of the Rings,

936
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,480
I listen to your cast on a regular basis and just thought it's share something with you.

937
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,920
The body shop to a fabulous product, it's the sesame shaving cream.

938
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:19,360
Now, I'll tell you what, this stuff is the best and it leaves your face or at least my partner's

939
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,360
face.

940
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,560
Silky soft.

941
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:26,440
You have a partner and I'll be like a boyfriend or a husband, partner, sound so official,

942
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,120
like you have more than one.

943
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,080
Maybe it's just a wishful thing.

944
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:35,040
There's also a face protector that you put on after this, which adds the redness that

945
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,040
you make it, which adds the redness that you make it afterwards.

946
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,960
Oh, but once you've used this cream, there's no going back.

947
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,800
No rash smells delicious as well.

948
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:48,800
Actually, combine with a mock three and there's no going back, great for your legs as well

949
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,320
if your female or otherwise inclined.

950
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:56,480
Oh, the way, that's all I wanted to say, Charlotte, thank you very much, dear.

951
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,440
Rob Stokes next up on the Gmail and by the way, I love it when you guys do these an audio

952
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:06,760
comments because, you know, it's like an audio type medium, it says Cory Greenberg, who's

953
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:11,520
in the old college buddy of mine that presenter on NBC's today show has a blog devoted

954
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:17,000
to old fashioned gentleman's shaving, escaping void.com.

955
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Says Cory, so I did a segment on NBC's today show about the lost art of wet shaving,

956
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,720
how old school razors, badger hair shaving brushes, and high end English shaving creams,

957
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:29,240
not only deliver the greatest shave that you can possibly imagine, but bring back the

958
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:34,120
pleasant, gentlemanly ritual that has been missing since the blood bath of 1971 when

959
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:38,760
EDM in led a coupe to become a coup to become the ruler of Uganda and you let introduce

960
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,560
the first twin-blade razor.

961
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,640
Nunes of people all over the world watch the segment and I guess lots of guys were unhappy

962
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,920
where their shave's too because the viewer reaction was unlike anything I've experienced

963
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,480
in the years I've been appearing on the today show.

964
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:55,920
As ridiculous as it sounds, the ensuing rush on razors, brushes, creams, created a worldwide

965
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,280
short as of shaving goods.

966
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:02,440
Vendors reported doing a year's worth of business just a few days, overnight, funky vintage

967
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:07,160
razors, caked with hobo whiskers and soap scumb that used to go for a few bucks on eBay suddenly

968
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:10,600
began climbing to well over $100.

969
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,600
How cool is that?

970
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:18,920
You know, of course, I'd say that, you know, maybe the metro sexual moment had something to

971
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:23,640
do with, I don't think NBC's today show could take all the credit, but now look, you know what,

972
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:27,400
I think it's just excitement about trying something different, that seems to be what's working

973
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,520
for everybody and that's why we're having these conversations.

974
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,800
Let me see if this audio comment is loud enough, I may have to stop the music on that.

975
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:38,360
Hi Adam, this is Robin from all critters.podshow.com, I was listening to the daily source code

976
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:43,000
today and I noticed you were looking for metro sexual moment comments on which underwear

977
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,280
women like on men.

978
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,800
Well, I'll give you my vote.

979
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,280
I like the ones that are called boxer briefs.

980
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:53,000
They're kind of like a hybrid between the boxer underwear, but they're not as like bulky and

981
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,640
baggy and they're like a brief because they're hugging and fitting, but they're not as short

982
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:02,120
around the leg, they go longer down the thigh to give me that wonderful, clean look and lie

983
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,600
and that goes well anyway, it's really sexy.

984
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,960
So that's the one I find sexiest is the boxer brief.

985
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:11,480
If you don't know what they are, go look for them, they might be fairly new because I don't remember

986
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:15,960
them being around a long time ago, but who knows, maybe it's just the guys over there, I don't know.

987
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:21,640
All I can say is that I like the boxer briefs, they're long, lean and they're good looking.

988
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:25,560
Hope you get a lot of other audio comments and feedback, few metro sexual moment, keep up

989
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:29,160
the great work on the daily source code, we're totally addicted, thanks, bye.

990
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,440
Thank you. I always love to hear from the ladies. They know what's going on.

991
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,200
This seems to be a general trend, guys.

992
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:41,400
It seems to be these boxer brief things and that's what I've worn for a hundred years.

993
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,080
I love them, you know, I like to have something going down my leg a little bit, of course,

994
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:49,480
I've got very long legs. I just don't like when I sit down and shit rides up on me, you know,

995
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:53,480
and I'm not talking about my ass because, well, I might enjoy that part, but you know,

996
01:02:54,440 --> 01:03:01,000
in my legs there, and scrunchy, no, no, no. I would rather go commando than have to wear

997
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,920
briefs or anything as scrunches up. Okay, let me see, I had one, I'm going to skip this one.

998
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:12,760
Okay, let's do this last audio comment. It may be too soft, so I may have to turn down the music and

999
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:20,120
see, yeah. This is Maureen. Michelle Suster from Whisper Pearls.

1000
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:30,200
Well, Adam, I love your voice for one thing. Okay, really hope. You were the following.

1001
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:39,320
Not boxer's and not exactly briefs. I know, the Metro sexual man wears these sort of in-between

1002
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:48,120
like Rostrichy, half-boxer, I have brief things and just very sexy and soft, and

1003
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:55,240
you know, they come in exciting colors, not just the white, not just the black, and not just the

1004
01:03:55,240 --> 01:04:06,920
black, and if a man gets an erection, they sort of move with him, not lob out of a boxer's

1005
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:16,440
short, and not get sort of tight and squishy on the briefs. So that's my option. Those are like best,

1006
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:26,600
and I'd be really curious to know what you wear. This is Whisper Pearls.com. Listen, baby,

1007
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:35,000
I wear exactly what you like and you people, you better turn the volume down because I'm going to

1008
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:47,400
apply the ending. Yeah. Oh, man. Okay, Metro sexual moment. Okay, just one more topic that I

1009
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:52,200
want to get into. Hey, Adam, I wanted to send you my comments about the white listing issue.

1010
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:56,840
This fucking white listing issue is piss me off. Hold on a second, let me just say what that is.

1011
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:03,000
This is about sending emails. If you send emails from a company for registration purposes,

1012
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:09,320
you will, if you get any great number of these, and as you'll hear in a second, even if you just

1013
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:17,640
have a whole bunch of people on a CC line for a company email, you can get blacklisted.

1014
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:22,600
And that means that you're trapped as spam and you aren't put through to the large providers.

1015
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:28,680
Namely, the big ones would be hotmail and MSN both Microsoft properties. There's actually a company

1016
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:35,160
that you have to deal with specifically to be removed or put onto the white list for those companies.

1017
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:40,520
And now we know that America online is coming with their email tax. And so that's what this

1018
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:45,800
white listing is about. As my day job, I teach at a local college and some of my classes are online.

1019
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:50,120
And when the class starts, I email all my students to tell them about the class, how to get started,

1020
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:55,480
et cetera. To start of this semester, when emailing my students from my college domain,

1021
01:05:55,480 --> 01:06:01,960
which is an EDU, I received six underlippable messages from a very large webmail provider.

1022
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:06,520
After a little research, I discovered that I had been automatically blacklisted because I was

1023
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:12,520
sending bulk messages to this webmail provider. It didn't matter that they were emails that were

1024
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:18,520
expected by the webmail provider customers, i.e. my students. So I contacted this webmail provider

1025
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:26,840
and it was suggested to me by them that I send individual emails to my students. They webmail

1026
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:34,840
provider stated it was their policy to block all incoming bulk messages to protect their customers.

1027
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:41,160
I have over 150 students each semester to make emailing students easier. I use the email program.

1028
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:46,360
It's integrated into our online learning system. So all I have to do is compose the message

1029
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:52,280
select the class and email it to the students. I'm not going to sort through over 100 email addresses.

1030
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:57,880
Eat semester just to find the addresses for this particular webmail provider to send those

1031
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:04,120
students separate messages. The good news is, I complained and complained and it looks like they

1032
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:09,160
have whitelisted me. Now, I never received the confirmation email about it, but my messages

1033
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:14,760
are not blocking more. And when I'm not teaching, yes, I do produce a podcast, mostly news,

1034
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:18,600
and you can check it out at mostly news.net. Good flying at them. Talk to you later.

1035
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:22,440
All right. Thank you very much. And I'm very happy you sent that audio comment in because

1036
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:26,680
a lot of this sounds like really geeky talk. And I know that a lot of listeners to the Charlie

1037
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:31,080
say, you know, I kind of tune out of skip past all the tech talk. But this affects you. Here it is.

1038
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:36,520
It's affecting a college professor, you know, and he has a dot edu address. And by the way,

1039
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:40,680
I'm happy that you're getting trapped in this as well because the minute they say, well,

1040
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:45,320
we'll let dot edu go through, you know, then it's going to get really fucking messed up. It is.

1041
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:50,200
And then, you know, that justifies a charging dot com addresses. And, you know, what's a business?

1042
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:54,200
What's an individual? This is horrible. This is not the way email was intended to be. And it's

1043
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:59,480
going to be the next big frontier. You know, the fees are outrageous to, you know, to be insured

1044
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:05,800
that you're continuously on a white list. You know, maybe we need some kind of, uh, open source

1045
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:10,280
white list is what I was thinking. You know, something that that that consumers could pressure

1046
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:16,920
their ISPs into joining that should be some way that, uh, that we can verify email. And low and

1047
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:21,960
behold, Sean Murphy says, you've been talking about having to pay to get your email through to the new

1048
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:28,360
podshow signups. You should check out open SPF dot org. That's open SPF's share a pop of Fox

1049
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:34,280
slot. Make sure your podshow domains have SPF records in the DNS. I know Gmail checks. I'm not sure

1050
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:38,040
about any of the others. SPF and a nutshell is a way to designate which servers are authorized

1051
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:45,000
to send mail for your domain. Um, so that's a good one. And we'll definitely, uh, look into that.

1052
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,040
And, uh, that may be something that we want to have implemented. But I mean, this really has to be kind

1053
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:55,640
of on a, oh, shit. I don't know. There's some smart people, you know, you know, a day wine is going

1054
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:59,480
to come up with this idea. And then, you know, we'll all use it and then we'll all get blamed for not

1055
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:05,560
giving him credit. But someone, someone has got to come up with a fantastic idea to make this work.

1056
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:09,880
So that, you know, you can receive registration emails and the corporations don't have to pay,

1057
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:13,800
you know, you may want to be a corporation tomorrow. You know, you may want to start a company.

1058
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:17,640
And you'll, you'll see what you're going to run into with this shit. You know, this is, this is

1059
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:27,560
squashing entrepreneurialism. Um, Philip Masin, Masin, I think, from, uh, where's he from? Where's he from?

1060
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:32,520
Sydney. Hi, Adam email is probably the most used crappiest implemented application on the net to date.

1061
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:37,560
When SMTP, that's the simple mail transfer protocol was first created. I'm sure it's for a

1062
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:43,240
father's never imagined that it would be abused to the point it is now. I have an easy solution for it.

1063
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:47,560
When you register your DNS name through internet, why can't internet and cooperation with someone

1064
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:53,080
like very side issue a issue you a digital certificate for your server? If you receive an email

1065
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:57,880
from a server without a valid digital certificate, it gets rejected. With a valid digital certificate,

1066
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:02,200
you can ensure that the mail becomes the server. It says it came from. I don't believe you need

1067
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:06,760
individual digital certificates for individual mailboxes, but certainly a $2 per year certificate

1068
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:11,880
for a server would be the ideal solution. Okay. So here's the difference. I believe that these

1069
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:18,840
companies who perform white listing and are working together with ISPs and they're doing it

1070
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:26,840
under the guise of spam. This is not about spam only. Detecting spam. I think this SPF

1071
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:32,840
record all that stuff that makes sense. I think that is a good anti spam message or anti spam measure

1072
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:38,360
so that we know, hey, this is the server it's coming from. So if it is spam, we know exactly who

1073
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:44,840
to go to because it's an authenticated email message. So that would be an easy way to at least

1074
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:50,360
remove one big step in the process. So I like that and I think we should definitely go that way

1075
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:55,480
and to have a very sign or to have that a part of the DNS system, I think is a very good idea.

1076
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:05,320
However, what is happening, this I'm telling you this, this is the same as this is like a DRM

1077
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:10,920
thing. You know, there's these big mail companies. Microsoft has a singular company

1078
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:15,880
a deal with you. You can't tell me that there's not kind of some setup there. What is the

1079
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:21,080
name of that place? I have to find out the name of that company. So if you want to be whitelisted

1080
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:25,640
on either hot mail or MSN, there's only one company you can deal with. I mean, this is a fair trade

1081
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:29,720
practice this thing as far as I'm concerned. It's really pissing me off the more I look at it.

1082
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:34,200
Again, you know, Pod Show can afford to pay these fees and you know, we're in negotiations right

1083
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:39,400
now to try and get the 80,000 down to some other, you know, number that we feel a little bit more

1084
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:44,440
but it shouldn't have to be this way. This is not, this is a hijacking of emails, total

1085
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:50,920
fucking hijacking and anybody who wants to start a company, you know, you can create a website,

1086
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:55,960
you can get all kinds of, you know, you can open up an e-commerce store, you can do transactions

1087
01:11:55,960 --> 01:12:00,280
via PayPal, but the minute you want to communicate through the most common denominator of the

1088
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:06,760
internet, namely email, they are fucking hijackers sitting there just waiting to grab your money

1089
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:15,960
and it disgusts me. Hey, what happened to the wiki show notes? No one's updating it anymore.

1090
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:22,120
It's, we're behind this seems to be like, no, you know, no, I think what's going on is it's

1091
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:27,800
very, it's very hard to have the comments separate from the show notes. Somehow, I got to think

1092
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:31,800
about that. I mean, it's very easy to hit the comments. That's where all the passion comes out,

1093
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:36,600
but there's no more passion in the show notes. It's unfortunate. There's always a link to the

1094
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:42,360
what I can now call the user show notes on each, on the show site, on daily source code and

1095
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:48,600
query.com, but it's just not used. Okay, two more things about advertising. Oh, by the way,

1096
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:54,600
before I get into that, it just seems like a real obvious thing to me, you know, there's two ways

1097
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:59,640
to do it. We can fight, you know, the unjust, or we can try and route around it like we've done

1098
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:06,280
with a music business, with a pod safe music movement, which goes hand in hand with pod casting.

1099
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:10,760
So, you know, we could always, I could talk to the Earthling guys about this. This seems like a

1100
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:15,720
perfect place for Earthling to step in and set a precedent, whether for an emailed registration

1101
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:22,040
system, or, you know, at least coming up with a way to make a whitelist thing very easy between

1102
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:27,560
users and who, you know, customers of Earthling and users who want to communicate with them.

1103
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:33,480
They could be transcending, and I bet you that, you know, in large numbers,

1104
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:38,040
consumers can show what they really, you know, they can move with their feet, right?

1105
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,280
So I think that we'll probably have to do that one way or the other.

1106
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:47,240
Yes, so there was a meeting in New York, by the way, with Earthling, because we're moving closer to

1107
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:52,840
upgrading advertising. Stay tuned. Now to the comments. Oh, I'm Adam. I just finished listening

1108
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:58,440
to Daily Source Code episode number three, four, one, and I had a thought about all this Earthling

1109
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:03,080
advertising you've been working on. I think the problem is that traditional,

1110
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:07,480
by the way, that comment about Earthling was not meant as an advertisement. I meant it as a real

1111
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:12,680
comment. This is kind of coincidental. Lots are just too long with a podcast. You tend to hear

1112
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:19,320
the same spot over and over. So a much shorter spot will do. There are also are not so many issues with

1113
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:24,600
static changing the dial, catching in the middle. That sort of thing. If you hear the

1114
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:29,640
advertisement, you tend to hear the whole thing you tend to hear clearly. So instead of a 30

1115
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:35,880
second spot or a 22nd spot, why not look for something in the 5th to 10 second range? For example,

1116
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:42,680
I've trimmed one Earthling ad down to about 7 and 300ths of a second, and I think it communicates

1117
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:47,080
the message pretty good effectively, but it's a lot less annoying and it takes less time,

1118
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:51,640
which leaves more room for either more content or more ads in the same amount of space.

1119
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:57,080
Where are you, Link? Make this smart choice. Visit earthling.net and discover what our

1120
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:04,440
internet experts can do for you. Right. So I agree with you when I disagree with you. First of all,

1121
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,200
you're not going to hear me play the Earthling commercial on this Charlie because

1122
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:13,240
what's the point is to talk about what that company is about and what they're doing

1123
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:18,200
and to involve them in the conversation. I'm not getting paid for Earthling by seconds that I

1124
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:24,600
play anything. I think that's even the three quarters of a second or whatever you cut it down

1125
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:30,440
to even that's boring. These are the things that we've got to work on. Every single, was it

1126
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:37,880
Paul, was it Paul Pinfield from podcast user magazine? He wrote this whole article and there's been

1127
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:47,960
some back and forth in the weblogs about it about business models and he lists three models

1128
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:56,760
and what no, what everyone seems to be overlooking is that advertising is currently geared

1129
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:03,880
and there's a trillion dollar industry or 800 billion dollar industry. My phone is ringing. Hold on,

1130
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:11,560
who's that? Oh shit, it's KJ, hold on. Let me just, ah, let me see if I can still get him. KJ.

1131
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:20,840
I'm taping the show, you're on right now. Hey, yeah, I'm taping the show, you're on.

1132
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:29,000
All right, no, it's like phone is frozen like the West Virginia York. So since we're on the Charlie,

1133
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:36,440
how's it going in New York, man? I was just talking about Earthlink and I just mentioned

1134
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:44,600
you had a meeting with him yesterday how to go. Hello? Sorry, I think you're a connection

1135
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:49,720
might be a bad one. So I was just, I was just saying that you had a meeting with Earthlink

1136
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:57,160
yesterday in New York. Oh, it sucks, hold on. I said that you had a meeting with Earthlink yesterday

1137
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:03,000
in New York. We did it. We had an excellent meeting with the folks at Earthlink and I think things

1138
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:10,440
are progressing nicely. It's a, you know, I think it's a effort that is going to be a very,

1139
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:15,880
very interesting one. It's just going to be a process of planning everything out and making sure

1140
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:22,440
it's executed well. They're very excited about it. We're very excited about it and I think we'll have

1141
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:26,840
some interesting things to talk about fairly shortly. Dude, I got to step back for all the

1142
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:33,960
enthusiasm that's just spouting out of my phone. All right, listen Chris, let me finish

1143
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:38,600
a show and I'll call you later, okay? Well, thanks. All right, buddy, take care. Bye.

1144
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:46,920
There you go. Straight from the horse's mouth. Oh my gosh. Chris is great. He sounds a little dry

1145
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:52,760
and I kind of hijacked in there. There you go. I tell no lies. It's actually happening. It's

1146
01:17:52,760 --> 01:18:00,040
actually true. So with all this media changing we're doing, I know of, I'm repeating myself.

1147
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:06,120
I just have to say it. Advertising will change as well. Right now, it's a, it's a clash, you know?

1148
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:14,120
It's like, it hurts. Everyone understands it. Everyone gets it, including some switched on advertisers.

1149
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:19,240
We're having the conversations right now. We're being very careful. We're planning because we're

1150
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:24,280
putting something on the map here. We're going to change advertising. We're going to change the

1151
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:30,680
value. How it's measured? It's going to be, it's, that's what that's the kind of enthusiasm that

1152
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:38,600
to, that I'm talking about. One more then. Hi Adam. This is Michael Kickingbear,

1153
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:45,480
what the indigenous people's music podcast. And I just checked out an interview on CNBC with

1154
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:53,320
someone from EarthLink. I guess they've put a bit in to be the primary provider of a citywide

1155
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:59,080
Wi-Fi network. I was wondering if you had heard any insight about that. Apparently they're also

1156
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:07,560
looking at Chicago as, as a second city to be involved with this. I would think any broad rollout

1157
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:13,800
of Wi-Fi and broadband internet is going to be great for podcasting. As more people can be

1158
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:20,120
connected and pull down content. So I didn't know in your discussions with EarthLink recently

1159
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:25,160
if they alluded to, to how that was going. But I was just kind of interested in sort of thought

1160
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:31,400
about the DSC and everything that you've talked about recently. I guess the upcoming involvement

1161
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:37,240
with end users, EarthLink's ad campaign process. So anyway, it's just curious about that.

1162
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:42,120
Thanks again for listening. Thanks for the DSC. And again, this is Michael Kickingbear,

1163
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:51,000
indigenous people's music podcast at www.native-music-podcast.com. Thanks. Dude, bye bye.

1164
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,040
Dude, that is such an awesome name. Michael Kickingbear.

1165
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:59,640
It's like to introduce you. Here's the taxi Eric Michael Kickingbear. You know,

1166
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:05,480
check the leaning muel. Everybody's here. And I passed on your request at the Native American

1167
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:11,960
as a genre to the podcast. Music now work absolutely. Well, you know, this is, I think we're

1168
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:17,960
going to get to this. What you're hearing now is a conversation which is relevant to the listeners

1169
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:24,040
and contributors, I might add, 70% of the show is made up by you, whether you're making music,

1170
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:28,920
whether you're making jingles, whether you're sending an audio comments or emails. It's made up by you.

1171
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:33,480
I'm just kind of mashing it up and assembling it and we're calling it a podcast. But, you know,

1172
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:37,720
we're a community here. We're doing something. We're talking about Wi-Fi. We're talking about

1173
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:43,800
email, blockages and guess what? Wouldn't it be awesome if we could bring Earthling into the

1174
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:50,280
conversation? It'd be good for them. It'd be good for us. It'd be good for all of us as collective users.

1175
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:59,720
Okay. Oh, man. I don't think I've done a podcast this long and ages. In ages, I tell you.

1176
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:07,320
Okay. We're almost done. I just want to get it all out. You know, there's so much, so much.

1177
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:12,840
Just get off my chest so I can have a clean empty weekend. Please indulge me. I just wanted to say

1178
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:19,240
I'm really digging in the new G-talk features or G-Chat in Gmail. If you can figure out my Gmail

1179
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:29,160
name, then you can add me. If you keep sending me messages, I'll block you. But, you know how it works.

1180
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:33,240
I don't know. I'm willing to try it out because that's not a different application. You know,

1181
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:38,920
and when I'm on email, then I'm also kind of in instantaneous chat mode that kind of makes sense to me

1182
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:44,600
to have email and I am integrated that way. Also thanks to all the writers who have been sending

1183
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:50,200
in emails. Yeah. We need writers in podcasting. Did you hear that rant? I just went through. It was

1184
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:54,760
so, I mean, you can hear the emotion, but I don't have the right words at the right moment. Like

1185
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:59,800
Mark Yoshimaru and M-Coff can do awesome rants on the Pacific Coast hell of ways. Really,

1186
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:05,800
really good. And, you know, I think I could, I just have to time, you know, just don't have the time.

1187
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:11,160
But if you write it, I could say it. And we work together. It would be, you know, we could make

1188
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:14,920
it a combination of our words and we could communicate even better what we're trying to say.

1189
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:21,080
Hey Adam, it's Seth from Radio Goon. I just wanted to point out that on the Podsafe

1190
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:29,400
Music Network, a lot of record companies are putting their artists songs on the network,

1191
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:36,120
but they're putting their own production company in the artist field. I find this as a podcast

1192
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:44,680
or extremely irritating when I'm searching for artists and I find, you know, X records or something.

1193
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:53,240
And then in the song name, they put the artist and the song. I don't know if there's

1194
01:22:53,240 --> 01:23:01,640
some way to enforce it, but it's pretty frustrating, just in general. Just thought I'd draw your

1195
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:07,000
attention to that. Love the Daily Service Code. Thanks. Thanks, dude. You know, I think that we have

1196
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:12,840
this has come up previously. There's a couple things going on. First of all, at its core,

1197
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:18,280
it's probably a design fault on R&D. You know, thinking Podsafe, we just never thought that

1198
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:24,360
record labels would join in. And there's tons of record labels. Even some big ones. Even some

1199
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:28,440
big ones who are uploading music to the Podsafe music network. I haven't made a big deal about this

1200
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:34,280
because I actually have mixed feelings about it because, you know, is it really happening,

1201
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:37,400
you know, on the up and up or are they just kind of, you know, are they sliding underneath the

1202
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:42,920
law and just, you know, are they doing all these things? And but on the public side, you know,

1203
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:51,400
suing soccer moms. Once you try and sue a soccer girl, you boys, I'd like to see that. She could sue

1204
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:59,160
you so hard and I'd back her up. She's on the network, you know. But I too have noticed that.

1205
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:04,200
And Michael Butler has been instrumental at getting all these independent record labels in.

1206
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:08,760
And since we don't really have a facility for it in the, uh, I guess in the database,

1207
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:15,560
and also because the owners of, um, of the material that's uploaded are the record companies in,

1208
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:21,480
I'd say 99% of all cases. You know, you join a record company, um, the record company pays you

1209
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:26,360
and you basically give up the masters. And so, you know, upon uploading to the Podsafe music,

1210
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:31,240
that work, you have to be the rightful owner and in many cases, the record companies are the owners.

1211
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:37,000
So there's also kind of an ownership thing on, on, on their side. Um, so indeed, this next song,

1212
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:41,800
which is from East West Records, which I think is a, that's a big one. That's a pretty big, uh,

1213
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:48,600
it's, it's an indie label that is sub-label of something big. Um, this is song called Los Angeles by

1214
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:56,280
patent pending, which I'm going to play for you. Um, and indeed, it's, uh, it shows up as East West

1215
01:24:56,360 --> 01:25:01,480
Records. You know what, I'm going to, I'm going to dive into it. Uh, it's something that will definitely

1216
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:07,560
have to be put on a little bit longer term, uh, but I do agree. It's a pain, uh, but of course at the end

1217
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:12,840
of the day, it's the music, the counts, right? And boy, does this kick ass? Perfect Friday song.

1218
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:32,280
Getting better, gather, ladder, know that there is no time and have no one ever said forever.

1219
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:40,520
Me do at the time, I'm lost. Please get me out of, got to be kidding me. There's

1220
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:46,120
coming, we'll let you throw away this chance of a lifetime, you'll be so fine. Say nothing

1221
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:51,560
because nothing nice to say. There's no, there's no way, people lose this meaning.

1222
01:25:51,560 --> 01:26:02,760
Lord, it's all in our screamer screamin' screamin' out loud. I said the said to miss a seeding out her soul.

1223
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:11,960
She said, I'm tellin' like your father. She said the way, they tellin' we'll be sure we don't find.

1224
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:19,800
Getting better, gather, ladder, know that there is no time and have no one ever said forever. Me do at the time,

1225
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:30,200
I'm lost. Please get me out of, got to be kidding me. There's coming, we'll let you throw away this chance of a lifetime,

1226
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:34,200
you'll be so fine. Say nothing because nothing nice to say. There's no way, there's

1227
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:44,360
people lose this meaning. Lord, it's all in our screamer screamin' screamin' out loud.

1228
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:12,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. She said, boxed, Angela, this has never been so good.

1229
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:24,840
She's died, we'll shine in it and fall on her. She said, the way, they tellin' we'll be sure we don't find.

1230
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:36,360
Getting better, gather, ladder, know that there is no time and have no one ever said forever. Me do at, got to be kidding me.

1231
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:41,960
Darling from coming, I know that you're falling deep down in your body's vibrations,

1232
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:56,760
my fallen apart, get me out of here, get me out of here, get me out of here, get me out of here,

1233
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:04,360
yeah, yeah, I know that you're falling deep down in your body, get me out of here,

1234
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:10,300
I just can't stand.

1235
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:13,720
I'm having fun.

1236
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:15,780
Los Angeles.

1237
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:24,600
Get me out of here.

1238
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,320
Oh.

1239
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:28,260
Major error camps are going on here at the college.

1240
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:31,260
I heard my nerves going.

1241
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:33,360
I'd shoot crashing and flying pacitudes.

1242
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,800
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1243
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:36,800
Okay, that's it.

1244
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:37,800
I'm ending it.

1245
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:39,800
We've got to stop somewhere, hour and a half.

1246
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,120
I hope you guys don't mind.

1247
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:43,120
I just had so much pent up energy.

1248
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:47,320
I'm feeling really creative, that whole music video thing.

1249
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:49,680
Yesterday, just got me in a good vibe.

1250
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:52,000
I love all the energy.

1251
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,720
The wave is on an upswing.

1252
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:54,720
I can feel.

1253
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:55,720
I can feel it.

1254
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:56,720
All right, everybody.

1255
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:57,720
Have a great weekend.
