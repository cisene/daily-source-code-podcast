Delta Sierra Charlie 458.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay, Grandpa, just talking to the microphone.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, right there.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Right, yeah, that thing right there, the big circle.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Well, yeah, that's the pop filter.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
No, we're not getting a pop, okay, just read the paper.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Alright, alright.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah, there you go, right there.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Right.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You can't, you're always counting things.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Back in my day, we didn't count everything.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What?

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It wasn't all these numbers.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What do you mean?

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Just when you did something and you were done with it.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The DSC.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah, that's Adam Curry, he's...

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What?

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
He's a pilot, so say tailwinds.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So I'm off facing tailwinds, like you were a pilot.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Tailwinds, what did I float?

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Ah, geez.

I'm playing the game, I'm playing the new year

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm just laughing, I'm just running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm just falling for you

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's hard to make new

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Guess it's hard to leave

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's hard for money

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's within me

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm just playing the old one

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:44,920
I'm really got to thank Jeff Hins for making that suggestion. I no idea they showed up on the

87
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,680
pod save music network Jeff of course from the Friday night dance party podcast.

88
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,560
The Carmen Apicy Project which of course I have a member that coming out.

89
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,160
Now in the pod save music network there's three songs gunna rain days or nights

90
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,160
and what you just heard was nobody knew and the way the Carmen Apicy Project works.

91
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:14,520
Carmen man he's he's been around. Of course on drums he's a very well-known drummer.

92
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,960
Tony Franklin is on this you know him from blue murder probably from white snake,

93
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,040
Kelly Keeling on bass. He was in baton Rouge and I and I have a feeling that Ron

94
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,000
Ron actually produced a baton Rouge record. I have to ask him about that.

95
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:38,280
So the the guest solo guitar on nobody knew was Brian May of Queen fame. As if you couldn't

96
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,120
hear that very distinct sound. On the other songs that are also on the P and then you want to check

97
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,000
him out gunna rain guitar solo is by Richie Sambora and days or nights. Michael Butler's going to

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
love that. That's probably why it's on the pod save music network the new Ted Newgeon doing guitar

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,960
solo. Excellent. I mean what a way to kick off a football Friday because we really are all

100
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,440
footballer by the end of the week. Football fucked up beyond all recognition. This is the daily

101
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,160
source code episode 458 everybody how you doing coming to you from Curry Cottage in the

102
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,200
affluent suburb of Surrey known as Gilford. Let me get the Joseph Jaffee stuff out of the way right

103
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:17,960
away. No in no way have we gotten enough punishment in or any really good ideas. There's some good

104
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:27,160
comments over at daily source code.com on pod show plus. Let me see comic strip blogger things I

105
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,760
shouldn't let him air the second part of the interview regardless. What was another one that came

106
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:38,040
in somewhere? What is this? LePierre says you may have held your interview hostage but I think it's

107
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:44,040
pretty safe to say you held his balls hostage. So so far nothing really earthshattering this

108
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:50,280
coming. This is kind of normal for a pod cast because it does take a couple days for people to catch

109
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,800
up. So I think we'll have to wait until Monday as we have some suggestions streaming over the weekend.

110
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:03,240
Hey Adam it's Carlos again. Just a scene show for five six and I've started upon a punishment. I think

111
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:13,160
that Joseph should get a set and amount of listeners to your show so I'm increasing your traffic

112
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:19,960
from his pod cast and anyone who's done that he can play the interview. So thanks bye.

113
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:28,040
Yo he's already done that really just by I mean that was the whole point I think and that's kind

114
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:39,080
of where I'm a little torn over this. I see I disagree fundamentally with what Joseph did by saying

115
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,080
I'm not going to air the second half of your interview because you haven't sent me any link love. I just

116
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:49,560
thought that was really wrong and I think that he still thinks it's a joke and that I'm actually

117
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:59,080
making a this is some kind of traffic driving thing that I'm into or that we're both doing together.

118
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:05,560
Not at all. I certainly don't need his traffic. I don't care if he gets I want everyone to be

119
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,960
very successful. It's not about that. It's just about he was rude. It's fucking rude. That's all.

120
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,920
And he keeps sending me email messages. Are we okay? Are we on the right track yet? And it's like

121
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,960
it's not a game. This is real. And it won't be done until I think the listeners have spoken.

122
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,920
At least the listeners to the Charlie because it's bestowed all that crap on you, apologies.

123
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:37,160
Hey great news today. Let me just bring this up in the outline. One of our very own board members

124
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:45,400
at Potio Ray Lane became a granddaddy. So we welcome Walker Hugh Torrance Rollinson born at

125
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:52,920
945 PM last night, Stanford Hospital, 7 pounds, 14 ounces, 20 and 1 quarter inches.

126
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,960
Welcome him to the extended Potio family. Mom and baby are doing just fine.

127
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:04,440
Looking at the pictures that came in over email today. Granddaddy's doing very fine as well.

128
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,280
Oh man fantastic. The big question is of course. And this is a fantastic opportunity. We know

129
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Ray Lane is a scruncher. Will it carry through two generations of lanes? That is the question.

130
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,160
Hello Adam. Happy birthday. Happy belated birth. That should say from Colorado. Just catching up on

131
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:34,680
some DSCs from the past week, listening to 454. And after hearing about you to loud of gas incident,

132
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,800
I'm glad to hear that it was nothing more than a butt-puckering experience. Now we pilots,

133
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:51,960
we get those on occasion to remind us how fallible we really are. And I could tell that it was

134
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:58,440
that it was one of those experiences for you. My only take on the whole thing is, hey, use your checklist.

135
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:07,000
Checklists, of course, are designed to keep us out of trouble and to make sure that we

136
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:14,360
do all the things that we think we can do via routine. But as you know, as soon as we get distracted or change the routine,

137
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:21,080
that's when things get screwed up. Just like, you know, for getting to put down your landing gear because you dropped your pencil,

138
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:31,080
you know, it's that sort of thing. So use the checklist, please. I've enjoyed your work since the days of MTV

139
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:40,200
and hope to hear you for a long time on the DSC. So take care and folder. Thanks, Michael,

140
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,880
I appreciate your comments. That's a good question. I don't know, Robin from Inside Work, he's a pilot.

141
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,600
I think he may be a scruncher. I don't recall. I should write all that down. You know, this wasn't

142
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,040
really a case of following the checklist. This was actually a case of following the aircraft manual,

143
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,760
which is the most interesting thing about it because it really what happened was an accordance with

144
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,400
the manual, but not in accordance with reality. Now, a butt buckering moment, you better believe it.

145
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:11,240
When you're engine quits anywhere, even if for a second, it's a butt bucker. No kidding.

146
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,440
Dan and Captain Dan and I spent a couple minutes kind of glancing at each other after that. I'm going like,

147
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,000
fuck man. Dude, that could have been really bad. We were really, really lucky.

148
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,440
So the aircraft manual really, you carry that with you, at least I do. We have it within, within

149
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,320
reach, actually, all to always within reach. For instance, let's say that the landing gear

150
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,120
didn't come down, that we didn't get three greens. There is a way to manually pump them down.

151
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,480
I've never, of course, had to do that, and there is a procedure you have to follow,

152
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,000
and you wouldn't need the checklist for that, but really, I guess it's a checklist within the

153
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,880
manual. So we followed the manual, actually. You know, if the, if the right tank is depleted,

154
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:56,040
switched to the left tank, turns out that the indicators that Sessna makes are pieces of crap.

155
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,920
So it's always flying on both, but I appreciate it, and you're absolutely right. And

156
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:08,840
regarding landing with your gear up, you know, that really are only two types of pilots.

157
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,760
Those that have made a gear up landing, and those that will.

158
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:34,840
For Adam in Great Britain, dial plus four, four, two, seven, six, eight, one, three,

159
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:42,360
seven, five, three, plus four, four, two, seven, six, eight, one, three, seven, six, eight, one, three,

160
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,560
seven, five, three. Thanks for going on the daily source code. Good bye. Oh,

161
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:54,600
fold it as concha. Jeff Smith, everybody. He heard this shout out. He heard the call. He couldn't

162
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,000
stand those horrible jingles. I was actually they weren't horrible, but these are definitely nice.

163
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,520
Jeff, thank you so much. I love it. So you got the numbers now. They're embedded into your brain.

164
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,720
There should be in your cell phone. Whenever you're hearing something, whenever you think about something,

165
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,720
just pick up the phone and call. You know, they're not to be about the show. Can be about anything.

166
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,000
Of course, sometimes it's about the show. Hi, Adam. This is Mark Furnish from Albany, New York.

167
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,280
I don't fold or scrunched because quite frankly, I don't go to the bathroom. I think. Okay. So

168
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,520
he's pretty much set himself up. He's a full of it, I guess, on toldry.

169
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,960
Anyway, I'm really interested about what you were talking about editing your podcast and taking

170
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:36,840
up the ears and the arms and things like that. You know, that's a good point podcasting should be raw.

171
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,600
No, hold on a second. I really want you guys to listen to this because he's going to

172
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,800
misunderstand what I'm saying and I think he doesn't really have a grasp of where my head is at,

173
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:53,240
which granted could take some effort to get in the same headspace.

174
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:01,480
So exactly that. I just heard me go, you know, I wouldn't edit that. This show is live to MP3.

175
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,280
You know, I record everything in real time, right off a cast blaster, right onto the MP3 file.

176
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,080
I don't take anything out. I don't think I've, I can't recall ever editing a daily source code

177
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:17,080
post post creation because I like it when it's, you know, there's an energy that you have to have.

178
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,560
And I don't, I don't want to safety net. It makes me, it's, yeah, that's really it. It's like not having a

179
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,200
safety net. So if I want to reduce the arms and arms and if it really bothers the audience,

180
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,080
I'll do it. I'll work on it. My audience will help me in fact. Charlie listeners have done just that.

181
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,760
But I think you take, you're failing to put into consideration the fact that

182
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,560
good people like yourself have the best top-notch podcasting equipment available to you.

183
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:50,200
Uh-huh. The best top-notch podcasting. Do you hear the hums in the background? Do you hear the

184
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:55,160
crunching and the crackling? You sound like you're recording from a professional studio, which you are.

185
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,800
Got to stop you, everybody. I'm not. I'm not podcasting from a professional studio.

186
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,560
I have a cast blaster, which will run on any Windows machine.

187
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:15,720
I have a, uh, a high-l, PR 40 microphone, which pretty much is is like the, I think it's become

188
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:22,120
some form of standard. It's a very inexpensive microphone. I believe it's under $200. The mixer

189
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:28,840
that I have is a sound craft, $150. He listened to this potential meter here. Actually, it's not

190
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,440
crackling now, but it's, it's really, really a sub-standard piece of kit.

191
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:43,000
And that's the loop. The only thing I have is a stereo valve processor, which, again, you can

192
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:51,080
buy a compressor for $100. So you could be done for about $500. That is not the type of

193
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,920
studio I think you're describing. Which is fantastic. And I wish I could do that as well.

194
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:00,920
But when you're just working from a common computer microphone and like a free audio program,

195
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:06,200
like Audacity, your program sounds like shit. And you want to do, uh,

196
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,360
Audacity has nothing to do with your program sounding like shit. It's just a recorder.

197
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,920
And your cast blaster is free for, for anything, uh, 10 minutes are under. I think there's

198
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:23,320
enough value there to buy it if you want to make longer shows. But Audacity is fantastic.

199
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,760
Now, that's not a real-time live thing, but it will record. It will let you edit. It will let you

200
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,160
process the sound. It will let you do everything that professionals actually do. In fact, if I used

201
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,360
Audacity, my show would probably sound more, quote, professional. Not the sound I'm looking for, though.

202
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,040
Anything you can't have a try to make it feel better. And if that, I think that means kind of like

203
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:47,640
taking out the other the eyes or quite frankly, it becomes unlicable. I'd really like to see an

204
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,040
experiment from you sometime. And I don't know if it's even possible. But I'd like to see your

205
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:57,240
record your podcast from a, just a normal computer microphone that you could get at a radio

206
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,560
shack, or I don't know if they have radio checks in Europe, but any kind of computer store,

207
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:07,640
and using a free audio software program and do your podcast like that to see how it sounds.

208
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,880
Now, you have years of broadcasting experience. So you sound polished as it is, and that's a good thing.

209
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,640
But I'd be really curious to see how a polished podcast you sound using just every day, cheap,

210
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:26,280
normal equipment on a podcast, and see how it sounds, and not using the expensive equipment that

211
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,160
the top notch podcast is used. I think that'd be interesting. And if you ever do that sometime,

212
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:36,760
I think it'd be really fun to hear. Take care Adam. All right. So let me just respond to a couple

213
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:43,800
things there. First of all, the editing and the quality of the studio. I mean, look, there's a lot of

214
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:49,400
people on the radio who are in million dollar studios that just sound like shit. Don't belong

215
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:56,760
there whatsoever. Lots of them. So, you know, it's, it's all about just the quality of the content,

216
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:02,040
and not about the, the quality of the sound, or, but I will do the experiment with you. Hold on a second.

217
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:09,000
Let me, let me just grab, I do have a cheap microphone. Here we go. In fact, I, I'll,

218
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:16,120
we'll say that I don't even have a stand, okay? So I'm holding it in my hand now. Now the trick

219
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:23,640
would be to turn off the processing. Let me see if I can do this. Hello, hello, hello, okay. So this

220
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:30,120
is me on a cheap microphone with, so I've turned off that stereo valve processor. Nothing is running

221
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,600
through it. I got to tell you, I don't think it sounds all that bad. I really don't. And I still

222
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:41,480
hear all kind of all the, you know, the, the crackling and the, and I hear a very distinct hum in the

223
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:48,040
background. So, you know, will this stop people from listening? I just don't see it, dude. And I just don't

224
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:53,880
see it. Now, the, what I'm talking about is clearly something else. It's about the, about being

225
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,160
people, about being human. This is not about having, you know, in fact, I think that if, if I,

226
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,240
if you don't use professional sounding processing, it's even better because it's so much more

227
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,960
distinctive. Yeah, this, this is what it sounds like. This is what top 40 radio sounds like.

228
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:15,240
Oh, man. Hey, everybody. It's a hot dragon flavor for us. You 100. Yeah. Yeah. And then we've got to,

229
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,320
oh, sorry. I got to go to this one. And then, of course, you always have the,

230
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:27,240
WLT, W light FM. You know, then you've got like the news guys. And in the, and in New York,

231
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,680
news today, Bob, Cassinola is standing by for Bob, what you got down the on the street. You know,

232
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,480
so I think it's more interesting to hear just a regular raw sound with all the

233
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:45,640
warts and the bumps on it. All right. Let me go back. Now, I will say one thing. I have found in,

234
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,600
in the past, that having a great sound in your headphones, which, of course, is just as much

235
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:57,320
a function of the headphones, as it is a function of a function of, of your setup and your microphone,

236
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:05,240
it really does motivate. For me, it does. I really feel in tune. And yeah, I just feel like I'm,

237
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,120
I'm in the show a lot more, like it's really, um, enveloping my entire head.

238
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,080
Smoked some of the only herbs seems to help, too, by the way. Those Republicans in the

239
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,680
audience have already purchased CDs that they are non-refundable.

240
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:33,640
George Bush lied about weft the mass destruction. Cleating got a blow job.

241
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,320
So there was deception added to the suction, but

242
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:51,160
Cleating got a blow job. Now what's worse, starting a war, are keeping your coheibas in a human human door.

243
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,640
Oh!

244
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:10,360
And who got impeached? And what for? All right. Cling got a blow job.

245
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,320
George Bush vacationed Juan New Orleans drowned.

246
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:22,320
He sat in a classroom with a tower's falling down.

247
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:29,320
He fucked up FEMA, which fucked up Katrina.

248
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,320
Not to mention the conventions of Geneva,

249
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,320
with 23 civilians murdered in Haditha.

250
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:46,320
Now how can a man without a brain,

251
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,320
cause a nation so much pain,

252
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:58,320
cause a world to feel such hate for the so-called United States and how?

253
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:06,320
Cause a Congress held but act in the face of every fact I have presented here.

254
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,320
The comparison couldn't be more clear.

255
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,320
George Bush authorized leaks of classified information.

256
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:24,320
To make the case for attacking a sub-renation.

257
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:30,320
Well, they couldn't shoot him, so they had to shame him.

258
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,320
But if you know a single honest politician, name him,

259
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,320
and you've seen Hillary, can you blame her?

260
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:45,320
I mean, I'm sorry, Hillary.

261
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,320
We all got a take one for the two.

262
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:57,320
George Bush, fun, sex head that says that condoms don't work.

263
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:04,320
If they did it, both your daughters would be framing you, jerk.

264
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,320
Bush lied about his bus for driving drunk.

265
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,320
Clinton's biggest crime was having spunk.

266
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,320
And for choosing a statue, less than statue-esque,

267
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:25,320
and hiding her under the oval office days.

268
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,320
What else, George? What else have you done?

269
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,320
So research, abstinence, what else have you learned about?

270
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,320
Global warming, missile defense, going a wall from the National Garden.

271
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,320
Fun somewhere, everybody. It's not that hard.

272
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:46,320
Jack Abramoff, Valerie Plame, Al Qaeda's links to Saddam Hussein.

273
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,320
I will grieve, can you lay our record deficit today?

274
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,320
We're tapping in for leaking water, boarding power, hoarding,

275
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:03,320
great destroying, crazy, plowing, load of skinless steps.

276
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:09,320
And to my part, I'll play the pond.

277
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,320
If that's what it takes to get you gun,

278
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,320
I'm on my knees, George.

279
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:26,320
You can't find that on the pod save music network yet.

280
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:33,320
Perfect for a Friday. Eric Schwartz, Clinton got a blowjob.

281
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:40,320
You can't find that on the pod save music network yet.

282
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,320
But David E. Palito, my buddy in New York,

283
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,320
that guitar man from New York who plays in Central Park, who has his own podcast.

284
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
I love the company. He's working on it.

285
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,320
I heard this song on his episode of Think104.

286
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,320
I'm telling you, David E. Palito, Eric Schwartz,

287
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
these kinds are the dealings of our generation.

288
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,320
This is awesome stuff. These are cool songs.

289
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
You can sing along. They have a great message.

290
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,320
Very funny lyrics are just right on target.

291
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,320
I was offended though. I have to be honest about the Hillary Clinton comment.

292
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
I don't think that was necessary.

293
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,320
You know, Hillary's not ugly. She's a very intelligent woman.

294
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,320
No, I think she was cute back in the day.

295
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,320
Oh, I can't wait for the voice mail on this one.

296
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,320
We can't transmit because something else is already transmitted somewhere close to the secret storm.

297
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
What kind of transformation is it?

298
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
Could be a soft phone? Maybe a radio.

299
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,320
Can we listen to it?

300
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,320
Let me get the frequency first.

301
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,320
This is a generally speaking podcast network update.

302
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,320
Hi, everybody. My name's Cliff Ravenscraft.

303
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,320
And I'm Stephanie Ravenscraft.

304
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,320
Together, we record and produce the generally speaking weekly loss podcast,

305
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,320
a fan-based podcast devoted to the hit ABC show loss.

306
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,320
From the beginning, our purpose has been to take the casual loss viewer

307
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,320
and turn them into lost a hollocks.

308
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:08,320
It's work, too. We have thousands of listeners from all over the world, including some of the cast from the show.

309
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,320
Each week, we review the current episode of Lost, where we break the show down into two main segments.

310
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,320
Character analysis and exploring the mystery.

311
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,320
We also keep everybody up to date with Lost and the news.

312
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,320
You can learn who's going to be interviewed on what TV talk show,

313
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:30,320
and where you can find access to special deleted scenes on the net and things of that nature.

314
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,320
And of course, we're always happy to take a call from our listener line,

315
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,320
where you can be part of our show with your own thoughts and theories.

316
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,320
Here's a clip from a call we received from someone who any lost a hollock would recognize.

317
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,320
Hey, Cliff, Stephanie, it's for it.

318
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,320
Um, heard you guys calling, honey.

319
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,320
We want to invite you to come and get Lost with us.

320
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:57,320
You can find us on the web at generally speakingpodcast.com.

321
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,320
And if you listen to the generally speaking, weekly Lost podcast,

322
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,320
you'll understand why thousands of our listeners are saying to themselves.

323
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
We're going to need to watch that again.

324
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
I got to tell you, I'm a big lost head.

325
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
Is that starting again? Has the new season started?

326
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,320
Of course, I only watch it on, I buy it on iTunes.

327
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,320
And I usually have a marathon with myself.

328
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,320
I have two types of marathons.

329
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
One is iTunes.

330
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,320
When I see a Lost on iTunes, so I load it up.

331
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,320
And I load it up on the computer.

332
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,320
I've really tried the video I pod on the airplane.

333
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,320
And I start to hurt my neck after a while.

334
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,320
And my wrist gets limp.

335
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,320
And then, of course, there's the problems when I'm watching Lost.

336
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,320
So I watch it on the computer in iTunes.

337
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,320
And then I have Comcast cable at the condo in San Francisco.

338
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
And I always have a marathon of ontourage,

339
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,320
because you can get those on demand.

340
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,320
Everything's blurring together, my friends.

341
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,320
It really is.

342
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,320
But still, you know, the really nice cinematic stuff,

343
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
like Lost, I can't watch that on a small screen.

344
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
That's insulting to myself.

345
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,320
I'm not even getting half the, I wind up watching episodes of Lost.

346
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
Again, on television.

347
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
Of course, I like it.

348
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,320
But I've just amazed by the information that I actually missed

349
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,320
by watching it on a small screen.

350
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,320
Something to be said for that, I think.

351
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
Hello, I don't reach again here from UK.

352
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
I'm just driving back from work.

353
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
It's just gone midnight.

354
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,320
I just listened to the entire stuff.

355
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,320
It was a great person that was on Radio 4 today.

356
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
So it's all due away.

357
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,320
It's Thursday now.

358
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,320
No.

359
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,320
Sorry.

360
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,320
It's well.

361
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,320
No.

362
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,320
Oh, shit.

363
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,320
This is why I don't like stuff edited out.

364
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,320
How beautiful is this?

365
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,320
It's all like, anyway.

366
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,320
It's now Friday, but it was Thursday Thursday night.

367
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,320
Probably one of about half past eleven.

368
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,320
And it was called at three cool trees.

369
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,320
It's just quite a good radio program.

370
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,320
It was about how Nashville, a lot of control of the reckoning.

371
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
It's literally a channel as mentioned.

372
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,320
And sort of just basically how no one had a complete stop of it.

373
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,320
So you might want to listen to it.

374
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
It was quite musical.

375
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,320
A lot of things that I know you've been saying in this sort of some sort of perspective

376
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:14,320
of how the whole thing is managed by business.

377
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:21,320
Well, when you think we have quite as much an experience of it,

378
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,320
you just don't notice.

379
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:30,320
But hearing that from the CRS, then, you know, that was very clear message anyway.

380
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
Well, I would like to check it out.

381
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
I'm treating it on BBC.

382
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
Listen again on the website.

383
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,320
And I say it was called three calls from the trees.

384
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:45,320
And it was not half past eleven on BBC right there for one Thursday.

385
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,320
Anyway, thanks so much.

386
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,320
Right.

387
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,320
Hey.

388
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,320
Yeah, you know what?

389
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,320
I have.

390
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,320
It's good to have.

391
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,320
I have a set of amount of time.

392
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,320
I set aside every single morning for, for my daily round of podcast.

393
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,320
And I always have a couple of what I would call mainstream slots.

394
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,320
I have a channel.

395
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,320
I actually built up.

396
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
And then that channel just feels stuff in.

397
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,320
I think I call it the news channel.

398
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
You can get it off of my podshowplus site,

399
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,320
Adam.podshow.com.

400
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,320
And you can subscribe to my entire channel if you like.

401
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
And use that.

402
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,320
And listen to the same things I've listened to in the morning.

403
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:24,320
So I, I, I, I, I, I dropped one MPR show and the New York Times front page to listen to that program.

404
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
Of course, I'll have show notes.

405
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,320
I'll have a link in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com to the BBC.

406
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:34,320
Listen again service, which is kind of, it's pretty cool because you can find what you want.

407
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,320
But you don't have a lot of control.

408
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,320
It's all streaming and you can get a jump ahead a minute.

409
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,320
Or, you know, or 15 minutes.

410
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,320
It's, I don't really dig how they're doing that.

411
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,320
But yes, this is a show you must listen to.

412
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,320
I really recommend it.

413
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,320
And I can understand how you wanted to call in the minute the minute you heard that.

414
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,320
It really talks about how this stuff works, you know, how clear channel functions,

415
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,320
how the, and the country, country music business.

416
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
Wow, man, you want to talk about cut throat?

417
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,320
Oh, yeah.

418
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,320
So give that a listen.

419
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,320
If you want to know why, what we're doing is such an incredible revolution.

420
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,320
Hey there.

421
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,320
It's Angie B.

422
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,320
I love spirals and the chill cast.

423
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,320
And I just started a brand new video blog over on Podshow called,

424
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,320
Chillin' of Angie B.

425
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,320
What do you know?

426
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,320
If you've ever been curious to put a face to the voice, well, this is your chance.

427
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:34,320
I'm just going to be talking about my life and career and whatever else comes to mind.

428
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,320
It should be lots of fun and I'm just getting started.

429
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:43,320
So, once you head on over and check it out at AngieBchat.podshow.com.

430
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,320
Hope to see you there.

431
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
Oh, Angie.

432
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,320
So, Angie's already cut her side of hidden desires.

433
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,320
Which is a drama we're doing together.

434
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,320
So, I have to cut my lines and it'll have to interspersed.

435
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,320
I'm going to do that this weekend along with a new perversion for profits.

436
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
So, that should be out either Sunday night or Monday.

437
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,320
It's going to be really busy.

438
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:06,320
A Ron's coming to town, he's flying today, so he'll arrive tomorrow, mid afternoon.

439
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,320
Of course, he'll be completely wrecked.

440
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,320
So, I'm pretty sure Saturday evening and Sunday and Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday,

441
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,320
I'll be in the city in this, if London town.

442
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:21,320
We've got some pretty cool stuff working on with something special for us on Wednesday.

443
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,320
I'll tell you about that later on next week.

444
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,320
So, it's busy, but I'm going to be able to get some of this stuff out.

445
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
Time for another perversion for profit.

446
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,320
And, Angie, I loved it.

447
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,320
I loved it.

448
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,320
I loved just sitting there watching you.

449
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,320
That was incredibly cool.

450
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,320
Angie just sitting there with a microphone.

451
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,320
Nice.

452
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,320
Porsons of the show brought to you by the Accurate Target cast about the Accurate.

453
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,320

The finalists, though, and we'll be doing more ad challenges.

461
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,320

464
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,320
No, I don't mean that.

465
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,320
I have his support.

466
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,320
Every single end of the week.

467
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,320
When Friday comes around, I know that I won't have to worry about the music,

468
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,320
because the music college is on the scene.

469
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,320
His name.

470
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,320
I'd like to make a motion too.

471
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,320
I was like really stupidly dramatic.

472
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
I fucked it up.

473
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,320
You're on her.

474
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,320
Please don't bang that gavel.

475
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,320
You can try this cowbell out.

476
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,320
Let's don't give a nod.

477
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,320
To the hardest work in lawyers,

478
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
Jersey,

479
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,320
I'm a man.

480
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,320
Yeah.

481
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,320
He's Jersey.

482
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,320
I'm a man.

483
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,320
Yeah.

484
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,320
You're on her.

485
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,320
What do you say?

486
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,320
He might even live with this case.

487
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,320
Jersey,

488
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,320
I'm a man.

489
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,320
Yeah.

490
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,320
He's Jersey.

491
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,320
I'm a man.

492
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,320
Jersey,

493
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
I'm a gentleman now.

494
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
He's Jersey.

495
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,320
I'm a man.

496
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
Yeah.

497
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,320
I'm a man.

498
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,320
I'm a man.

499
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,320
No.

500
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,320
What's up?

501
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,320
I'm happy for our Friday.

502
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,320
He's Jersey Todd, the official musical, just of The Cha Cha.

503
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,320
Hey.

504
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
You got your cowbell out.

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,320
Yep.

506
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,320
I'm here.

507
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,320
All right.

508
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,320
Hey listen.

There's a human voice in your heart there is a choice

533
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:26,320
Don't fight the man who you know that you're in hell

Get on the porch and light your torch on over town

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

536

Take down the doors and light your torch up the ground
