Dang

53
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
I love you

54
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,360
Now, even though these headphones cause such a grin on

55
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,160
Daily source code 395. I love the trishes new headphones

56
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,080
Everybody how you doing welcome to the Daily Source code coming to you from the affluent suburb of Surrey

57
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,160
known as Gilford. This is the Daily Source code from curry cottage and

58
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,280
Very very busy today

59
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
Yeah, first of all

60
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:05,720
We're still a bit messed up when it comes to timing just because of the eight-hour time difference between San Francisco and here and the flight back, et cetera

61
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,960
yesterday

62
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,640
You know, I did the show and it really it did wipe me out

63
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,880
I have to say because you know, it's not like you just I make it sound

64
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,120
Pretty simple. I hope at least that's how I want it to come across

65
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,600
But preparing any show takes at least an hour of going through whatever there is and of course

66
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,760
You know, I had a big backlog of email and voice mail and feedback and audio attachments, et cetera

67
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,880
So living kind of within Gmail for an hour and a half then doing the show then making sure it's uploaded and then I'm like

68
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,440
Okay, I'll sit down and I'll all up fire up the dashboard

69
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,420
Which is how man when you guys see this you're gonna love it. It's our

70
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,960
Well, what you would call a player, but it doesn't really suffice to say it's a player as a part of pod show plus it really all of your

71
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,800
Your channels you can create your own channels that will roll out one after another

72
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,640
So you know, I listened to my news channel and which includes video from rocket boom and includes geek brief TV and it includes

73
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,280
the latest it's a half-hour show from the BBC

74
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,760
The New York Times front page Zifrank of course, and so you know

75
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,740
I'm sitting in the big green thing which is this reclining chair would I've had for ages ever since so oh

76
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,920
Man, we've had this thing since think new ideas in New York. I just realized we've had it for 10 years and it's pretty beat up

77
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,120
But oh man, I know many many a server admin who was slept in this chair

78
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
During a late night in New York

79
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:38,000
So I'm lying there and with a laptop on my lap and listening to the podcast and kind of browsing through you know some other

80
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,040
Backtated emails and and then I wake up like two hours later

81
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,200
You know with my my lap completely on fire because these power books get so incredibly hot

82
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,080
But I was so still I late so still

83
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,560
It didn't slide off or anything. It just stayed there stuck right on my lap and

84
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,400
Then there was another hour so that I dosed off during watching TV with the folks downstairs

85
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,240
So I was pretty messed up and decided to stay up a little bit actually

86
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
reawoke

87
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
Around I don't know 1231

88
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,880
Stayed up for another hour and then finally went to bed got up this morning around nine

89
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,440
So we're trying to you know, or I'm trying to manage myself back into the right time schedule

90
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,040
now the in laws have been here for

91
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,840
Almost two weeks now and of course they took care of the house and the animals are most importantly Christina

92
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,200
While Patricia and I were on our world tour

93
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,400
So as and you know Patricia's dad is a very accomplished

94
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
musician arranger

95
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:40,640
band leader and he and he Patricia both have a tremendous love for a big band sound combos

96
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,640
You know the the old jazz

97
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,520
Old school music which I love of myself as well of course

98
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,720
So I surprised them and we have tickets tonight to see Sinatra

99
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,440
Which is the show that we've the the musical that we've discussed on the on the Charlie several times

100
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,200
And so everyone's really excited

101
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,560
But of course it starts at 730. It's a London's West End so we got to leave the house at five

102
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,840
You know, which is right around the time San Francisco wakes up and we've got all these initiatives underway and then the team is coming in next week for

103
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,400
You know to get Pod Show UK rolling in the so it's just so much happening

104
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,920
So I'm gonna let the comments lead a little bit today and and I played brother love

105
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
Which you heard at the start of the show

106
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,440
Not without reason, of course, bro low being still one of the most played artists on the Podsaic music network of all times

107
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,440
But he also just had a concert in New York City and

108
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,760
Unfortunately we had just left the city couldn't be there to witness the show

109
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,960
But leave it up to the Charlie listeners to send in a report

110
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:47,760
Hey Adam this is Jeff Hines with a Friday night dance party podcast just got back from the

111
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:56,600
Brother love New York City show here and it was fantastic the place was rock and it was packed

112
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,720
It was out of sight. Yeah, it was above a strip club, but you know what?

113
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,880
Just because there was stripers downstairs doesn't mean that wasn't loving going on upstairs

114
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,040
With brother love and the people were crazy

115
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,020
It was great to see all the podcasters and all the

116
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:19,500
Podcas listeners and really really rocked the house. It was a great show and

117
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,420
Brother love put on a great show

118
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:27,980
So I give a shout out to brother love and all the podcasters and all the listeners because you know what it's working

119
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,060
What you're doing is working out there and people are loving it. They're digging it. They're coming together. It's a great community

120
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,500
And it was fabulous when brother love played summertime

121
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:43,340
Everyone was singing the whole song man. It was great the place was rocking

122
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:50,300
So you know, it's really working and the power of podcasting the power of the pod sitting

123
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,540
Isn't that work and the power of brother love so keep it coming and this is Jeff Hines

124
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:02,180
I'm the Friday night dance party with a report on brother love show here in New York City

125
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,180
Keep on podcast and peace out. Bye

126
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,580
All right, yeah, thanks, but he also called back later and said that

127
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,300
Believe it or not ladies

128
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:18,140
We're actually throwing their panties on the stage towards brother love. I believe it hands down

129
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,740
I believe it. Yeah, it really is working. It really is and

130
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,840
If if you haven't been over there yet go to music.podshow.com

131
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,140
Which is the pod safe music network and you can buy many of the tracks that are up there

132
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,900
We have like 30,000 or something that are already within the I think it's 30,000 within the network and

133
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:42,060
Everything that gets played on the daily source code as we ramp up towards our public data release is is made available for purchase

134
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,220
Through the PMN and

135
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:51,940
It's 99 cents per track nine cents goes for the actual transaction and the rest of the money goes to the artist

136
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,380
So you're supporting them big time when you purchase through there and of course

137
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,380
You can always re-log into your account

138
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:03,180
Download the song again. There's no DRM. It's an MP3. You can give it away. You can put it on all your devices

139
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,100
And if you do give it away as the person if they like it to go ahead and purchase their own copy

140
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:13,740
That's kind of the system that we're trying to cobble together here, but it seems to be working sales are actually happening. Love it

141
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,060
every single day I log into

142
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,700
our

143
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,160
Podshow plus beta site, which is still closed beta although I think we have

144
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,660
I'm just gonna guess. I'll say we have close to between four and five hundred people probably on it now

145
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:35,140
So this thing is really alive and it's it's populated even though the page is don't surface publicly yet, which you know

146
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,060
We only know what's gonna happen when when everything goes public

147
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:44,700
But we're getting very very close to the release and I'm kind of happy that there were letting people in

148
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,420
Lots of people into participating in the beta

149
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,620
Particularly you know, do we chose to get a lot of developers in so there's a lot of

150
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,420
excellent feedback but also a number of the or I think all of the

151
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:04,260
Podshow podcast network podcasters are in they're using the system if not just to upload through the podcast delivery network

152
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,260
but also and to really enjoy

153
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:12,340
The well, there's so many different facets to it. So every day I log in it seems like there's a new feature

154
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:17,380
There's something new happening and it's it's getting really really cool

155
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,260
Hey Adam, this is Joe from a guy girl in a bottle just wanted to give you a quick call

156
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:29,740
Say welcome back to Sonic California. Hope you have a good time down there. Oh, dude. This is how this is how behind

157
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:38,220
Hey my email and feedback. Sorry about that. Bonneray. Hey. I just finished using task blaster for the first time to post up a show to the

158
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,220
PDN get the whole integration and

159
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:48,700
Wow that stuff totally rocks save me a ton of time. I really like the way it does the show notes and everything and pretty jazz about that

160
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,580
So pass along to the developers not sure if you want to put that out on the deathcast

161
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:59,740
But that is really great. And I can't wait to see the response from the other podcasters

162
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:06,540
We'll take it their hands on some of these tools on another note if you in percussion would like to go do some wine tasting or

163
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,540
Partition while you're hard at work

164
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,540
Let us know would be more happy to

165
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,740
Send you a couple of recommendations in the area a couple of quick drives not too far from San Francisco

166
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,700
Talk to you soon have a great time

167
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,180
Cursus curses

168
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,380
See now I'm only hearing this now. We could have got

169
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,340
curses I say curses I tell you

170
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:34,540
Man I hate it when I'm behind I've had to go you know I've been deleting Gmail's again because my mailbox is full

171
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,140
I just you know

172
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:41,020
I got a lot of listeners and I really love all the feedback. I just don't know how to handle it all

173
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,580
I mean, well creating more time like like Joe just

174
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:53,580
Like he just mentioned you know I literally save 45 minutes in my normal production process now

175
00:12:54,060 --> 00:13:02,540
uploading to the podcast delivery network all the show notes go up automatically everything flows through and it does make a tremendous amount of difference

176
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,540
You know longer you know doing your ID three tags and all that stuff separately

177
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,260
So yeah, I can't wait until everybody gets their hands on that

178
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:15,180
That's for sure also I'm trying to kind of build a bridge over to the dev cast. I want the dev cast to be much a geeky here

179
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:21,260
I want to stuff to be talked about in there this way beyond my comprehension which I think will make a good mix where you know I can just

180
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:30,940
You know kind of go along for the ride for the flow and and interject some of my questions which coming as a user of technology will probably be helpful

181
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,940
um

182
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,940
But so I'm still gonna you know

183
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:42,060
You know put specific feedback about a lot of this beta stuff on the on the Charlie because it will pertain to all of us in the future

184
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,740
I am this is a Joel Bench from the thinking and driving podcast the thinking and driving calm

185
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,300
I've got a comments for the dead cat

186
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,420
Recently had my golden ticket and I've had a moment to

187
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,420
To poke around on the pdn data

188
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,020
It's great. I love the community seal. It's very cool

189
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,020
I do not have a question though

190
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,980
It seems that I had my podcast and I can then only

191
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:15,900
Add new episodes through the pdn now. I do understand that the the owner that have a unified platform for producing and and consuming

192
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,380
But I still want my podcast home to be my my personal blog which is on a

193
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,860
Wordpress blog and I'm using podcast

194
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,020
My

195
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:32,700
Right, and this is I remember this now so the whole thing starts to crap out because of a cell phone connection

196
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,500
Which is real bummer, but I did want to just respond to this briefly

197
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,260
This is a very good question

198
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,300
And it and it's really

199
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,300
Hmm

200
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,940
I don't know what category to put this under, but I think that there is a disconnect between

201
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,980
Podcasts and web logs and and there's also a connect between the two because

202
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,180
Really the way to create the easiest way to create an RSS feed or a podcast feed

203
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:05,820
Is by making a weblog and so that was kind of the default and has been the default for quite a while

204
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:11,500
Listen, you know, so here's how you set up a podcast you get a weblog that I put an RSS feed and then you know

205
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,740
You put your show notes into the blog post and then out the back end poop say

206
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,060
Show notes

207
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:23,900
Version of show notes with the attachment in the enclosure for the file so it can automatically get download and put on your iPod

208
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,060
Where else you designated to go?

209
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:35,660
But there I really feel that you know the weblog part of it is such a small part of what I really want on my my podcast home as as you describe it

210
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,020
And that's why we've brought in so many developers

211
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,700
To start working on different modules that are appropriate to what we're doing with media

212
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,940
I'm not just audio of course, but also video

213
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,540
And how that all fits into a social media network

214
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,100
So, you know my space is a social network

215
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,460
Facebook is a social network, but those are really for pictures and text and

216
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
How do you really connect

217
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,940
When it comes to sharing media and not just links to different blog posts or different pages

218
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,620
Excuse me since sale this since sale moment brought to you by geese radio

219
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,660
Since I'm not getting paid for them, I know as well do something with that moment, right?

220
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:23,580
Now, I also use a WordPress weblog for

221
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:32,940
For curry dot com and I often cross post the show notes of each individual show to curry dot com so

222
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:39,740
I've put out a challenge which is not a very big one. I don't think but you know we intend to be completely open

223
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:47,420
With with with with with with the PDN we've got all kinds of API so uploading your show doesn't have to work through cast blaster

224
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:53,420
It can work through a web interface. We have a flash interface and you'll be able to if you're if you have an audio program

225
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,020
It will be very simple for the developer of that audio program to

226
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,660
You know just add a little button that says upload to the PDN and it'll do that from there as well

227
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,540
So there's all different ways that you'll be able to get stuff in

228
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,660
But I like the idea of having a little widget or what we call a module

229
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:17,100
That will actually take the show notes of an individual episode and post them onto a weblog because I wouldn't mind just like

230
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,340
Flickard does you know you have a flicker picture and you want it on your weblog and you can say

231
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:26,300
Post this to my weblog so I think that'll be a cool feature to have so that's something that we are working on

232
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:32,060
But I have a feeling that when you really see the full power of the PDN and the fact that you can map your own

233
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,300
Domain name to it

234
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:39,180
So yeah, you can so I have a daily source code is now on the podcast delivery network

235
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,820
You can't see it because it's still a close data

236
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:48,140
But I fully intend to map daily source code.com to that individual page which is of course

237
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,620
The real way to control all of your content

238
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:58,220
By the way, does anyone know how if you want to be a registrar if you want to be you know like like network solutions or like go daddy

239
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,420
Is that a tough process?

240
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
I've been thinking about doing that for a while

241
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,940
I'm just not sure if they have all those positions been dulled out

242
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,340
I mean, I just really don't have the energy to dive back into I can or whatever the

243
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,900
Organization is called

244
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:17,340
the figure out who can become a registrar how that works if anyone can send me a pointer it would be

245
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:24,380
Well, it would be highly appreciated. Hi Adam. I have to disagree with the caller yesterday who suggested that you

246
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:31,260
Shouldn't have even mentioned the closest problem you are having with the audio on Monday for two reasons first

247
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,260
I laughed quite a bit

248
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,260
While I really felt your pain

249
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,700
I couldn't help laughing at how mad Patricia was getting you by laughing just as much as me

250
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,180
Once again, podcasting's best reality show

251
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:54,220
Second if you didn't mention it. I along with a few hundred otherwise asses would have been yelling at you via email

252
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,460
Hey dude, what the hell you're doing ever here of a windscreen?

253
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:05,340
The sad part is that you probably didn't hear the incredible job I did

254
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,180
of fixing your missing of the closing of the satellite window

255
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:15,260
I skillfully edited in an old announcement of what was coming up next on serious

256
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:21,020
serious listeners never knew that you ranted right on through the end of the serious window

257
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,260
I am forever your not so humble servant p-dub the satellite repair

258
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,940
Well, that deserves a shout out P-dub

259
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:37,260
Everybody sing along with P-dub's favorite song the satellite repair man coming after you

260
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,140
What's he going to do he'll picture missed in sessions and answer questions too

261
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:49,500
There's nothing in the universe and you can't do for you a satellite repair man

262
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,580
Woo

263
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,580
That's right

264
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:04,060
I wish a satellite repair man of your own for everybody listening to the show. There's nothing like having a great satellite repair man

265
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,260
Who can fix everything in the mix?

266
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:13,260
By the way, yeah, I got so I know the people listen on the delayed basis. I know people are weeks behind on the show

267
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,140
And by the way, I I really appreciate it when people want to catch up

268
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,420
Man, you can also just decide to drop a whole bunch of stuff. You know, just catch up

269
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,500
That's very interesting. I mean, is that because you don't want to don't want to miss

270
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:34,940
the continuing threads and continuing themes? I mean, do you do the same with traditional radio? Do you know what?

271
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,940
Of course, you I guess you can't really

272
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:46,460
I thought that was a non-sensical question, but in my mind, you know, I miss episodes of all my favorite podcasts all the time and I really go back

273
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:52,940
To catch up. What I do is just listen to the most recent one and see where we're at and that of course is an issue with my time

274
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,700
But anyway

275
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:00,860
Pdub said something really interesting there. He said, you know, this is a what a very nice compliment podcasting's best reality show

276
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,380
What happened on episode 395? I just want you to know that I'm not

277
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:15,980
Cognizant of what's going on. I do know what's happening and I think that show was really me pushing myself to the limits

278
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,620
And this was not because of just the sound it was because it was hampering the way I could communicate

279
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,220
I couldn't actually talk into the microphone the way I want to I had to think about other things

280
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,940
while talking and and I just won't do that anymore. I refuse

281
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,740
I've done this for years with mainstream media

282
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:39,500
You know the sound is shit on the station today because you know there's some other jock decided to to tweak the processing, you know

283
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:45,740
Yeah, so what you do is you you bear down you grin it bear down bear grin bear down on it

284
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,980
Whatever it is, you know you just shut up and move right

285
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,780
I hate it that I've always hated that and the same with television is oh my god

286
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,780
Patricia I had this long conversation about doing a video version of

287
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:03,660
Adam and Patricia, you know no longer the daily source code it's being completely captured from underneath me

288
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,340
And and you know and I say you know you have to understand that there's so much you were so

289
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:15,660
dependent upon other people and and their creativity and a lot of technical things can go wrong with television

290
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:22,220
And you know television only really works and you've got the right crew and it does take a crew it does take other people

291
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:28,380
You can't just throw a camera in front of someone and say okay now it's a video podcast

292
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:33,660
You know, now it's entertaining serialized video. I just don't believe that it takes so much more

293
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:41,020
You know the reaction shots when a director and the video switcher in the right vibe and the camera man is offering the right shot at the right time

294
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,540
That's a very creative process you can't just solve that with technology

295
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:53,900
So it so it really bothers me when I have to adapt to technological problems or other things that just hand for me

296
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,900
That are beyond my control

297
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,300
But at the same time while this was going on and while Patricia was laughing and she's no dummy

298
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:06,300
She she she understands that we're doing something new here and something creative and something fresh and by the way

299
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,780
We do have some experience having done our reality show

300
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,260
The Adam's family which we also did all the production of

301
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,580
You know that we're we're trying to find new ground and one thing is for sure

302
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,500
This show elicited a lot of response and

303
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:32,780
While I was getting pissed off I was cognizant of the fact that people have responded very positively in the past when I get pissed off

304
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,460
It's like yeah, we like it when you're pissed off an emotional so I think that

305
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,820
No matter what the emotion is it's a good thing

306
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,860
It's a good thing if you hear someone getting angry

307
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,620
Just as good as someone who's getting very sad or someone who's

308
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,860
Madly in love you any kind of emotion. I think if you can actually portray that

309
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,020
Which is what media does this is what songs do this is what

310
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,220
Television and radio try to do all the time except

311
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,580
Mainstream media has resorted to the lowest common denominator of

312
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,940
Giving you raw emotion and that is fear

313
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:15,820
That is fear that's why every single commercial not everyone but let's say just about every single commercial or news report or any

314
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,380
program other than some of really well written series and films

315
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:27,900
Are trying to reach out to hate your fear buttons because everyone kind of has the same thing with fear and it's pretty easy to predict what's going to work

316
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:35,100
One of the things I fear is the closing of the satellite window which is about to happen for you serious satellite listeners on serious 102

317
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:41,020
We got PCH Pacifico Selwai coming up next followed by yeast radio Don Andrew Gilmour gang and a new digital flaunts him tonight

318
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:46,700
And right after that Michael Butler and I'll talk to you guys tomorrow for the Friday festivities on the cha cha cha

319
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:55,580
Adam this is Doug and Boulder Colorado and I just got done listening to DSC 395

320
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,620
And I got to say I've been listening to hundreds of your shows

321
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:05,180
But I never laughed so hard is when you are screaming your equipment and your microphone and here your microphone

322
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,780
I got a time man

323
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,780
I was laughing at you

324
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,420
I was laughing with Patricia that was hysterical good job

325
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,820
420 from Boulder killings and

326
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,580
73s talk to you

327
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,780
That's awesome wait a minute. We had 420 tailwinds and 73s

328
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,900
So we had listen to this language man. We got a code all our own

329
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,540
Yeah, great. Thank you. Thank you very much

330
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,140
I was laughing too believe me. I really well as

331
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:37,900
You know it so this is the the conversation Patricia and I had she said you know people are emailing us calling us from all over the world saying

332
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:43,340
You know this is better than reges and Kelly now that of course can be taken in many different

333
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:49,900
ways as a insult or as a compliment, but you can't deny that there's a lot of people watching that particular television show

334
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:55,180
Which is a a US morning talk show for those of you not in the know or not in the country. I should say

335
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:03,100
And indeed what is that show? It's a it's a grouchy guy gets pissed off a lot and and a beautiful

336
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,620
Sidekick woman or I was it's not a sidekick actually

337
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,340
It's presented as a sidekick

338
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:16,780
But of course when it was Kathy Lee and and now Kelly, you know, it's a beautiful woman who was pushing back and it's that

339
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:22,620
It's that very dynamic which is which I think you're hearing work when Patricia comes on the show

340
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:27,580
Now of course, let me say right off the bat if if this was the Adam and Patricia show five days a week

341
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:34,220
You know we'd have to quit a whole bunch of other jobs. We have it takes a lot of it takes a lot out of you

342
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:40,940
And it and it can't always be fantastic and you know you run into ruts and routines and that's another thing that

343
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:46,220
That I'm experimenting with you know you'll you'll see me go off and do something completely different interview or

344
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,220
And not even interview or talk with Charles Fleischer

345
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:55,100
And then I'll go flying and then we'll do a breakfast show just trying to mix it up a little bit and not everybody likes it

346
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:01,500
But at least that you don't fall into some monotonous tone which is bad for I think listeners

347
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,620
But also bad for creators because it just becomes a

348
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,100
Format that you kind of crank out and and you can get very very lazy very easily

349
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,700
And there is there is kind of a

350
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:17,100
What is the thing we're talking with Charles about the the golden ratio?

351
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,660
You know there's there's in in art and drawing and architecture and physics

352
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,620
There's certain patterns and sizes that are feel comfortable to the human well to the human spirit

353
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,220
Really just to look at them the size of a credit card actually is based upon the golden ratio

354
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,260
Same thing holds true for podcasting somehow

355
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,620
There's a golden ratio that you can hit and it doesn't always come in the same form every single time

356
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,220
But it is out there and

357
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,220
Together we shall explore it

358
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,860
Hi, Adam Steven Shlanker here from the coolness round-up part of the pod show family

359
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:51,820
I just couple of quick comments about listening to your later show the first is dreaming of second life

360
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,100
I've tried second life, but it really kind of slowed down my computer

361
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,940
So I really haven't been back in since but I do play world of warcraft

362
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:05,740
Which is a massive multiplayer online RPG game which also immerses the viewer or the player in a 3D environment

363
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:10,220
Where they can go on adventures gaming and do things with other online players now

364
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:15,900
I've noticed that after a particularly long time at play on a particularly intensive quest that I too

365
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,700
End up dreaming about the online world at night

366
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:24,060
I'm not an expert on dreams, but one school of thoughts says that our dreams are our brains way of

367
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:28,860
Unwinding from the days event, so if you spend too much time in second life or in world of warcraft

368
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,420
It would make sense that our brains are playing things back

369
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,500
Of course for it also set a cigar is sometimes just a cigar

370
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:40,780
And regards to your bad audio show and the listener who called in to say that your yelling was very in professional

371
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:47,580
I just got to say I loved it now. I too go on a yelling rant when pieces of technology just aren't working right

372
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:52,300
And you being yourself just shows that you're just an ordinary guy like the rest of us

373
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:58,780
Anyway, just wanted to chime in on how much I enjoy the show and how much our podcast the coolness round-up the tech show for everyone

374
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,940
It's happy to be part of the pod show network

375
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,860
We've got a lot of great shows coming up including our one-year anniversary show in a few weeks

00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:10,300
listeners can find us at podcast alley iTunes or coolmasroundup.com. Thanks Adam have a great day

377
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,940
Hey Adam hey DSC listeners

378
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:17,660
This is Scott from American cliché, and I am proud to announce that I've joined the pod show family

379
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,260
That's right while doing my little show about politics and bizarre news

380
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,660
Featuring my silly observations about life

381
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,700
I somehow managed to suck her pod show into signing me

382
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:35,500
I can't wait to drive Trinity around San Francisco hang out at the curry condo and get my sweet corner office at pod show headquarters

383
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,900
It's gonna be

384
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:45,020
Oh, Adam doesn't let people drive Trinity around. Oh, okay. Well, I mean, I probably will need a car from hanging out over at the condo

385
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,100
Oh, okay. I can't go to the condo either and no office

386
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:55,020
Okay, you know what that that's fine. That's fine. I'm still really excited to join pod show

387
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,500
Hey, you guys if you want come on over to my site

388
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,300
American cliché dot net and see what my show's all about

389
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:05,340
You can also do a search and iTunes for American cliché and Adam and the rest of the gang of pod show

390
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,100
I have no idea where you were smoking when you decided to include me in the network

391
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,340
But you know what? I don't care. I'm just excited to be a part of it

392
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,380
All right

393
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,420
That's all that takes man. We're smoking excitement here. You know what I'm saying?

394
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,980
It's time once again

395
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,580
Little cowbell first

396
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,380
Trinity

397
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,380
It's all good

398
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:21,020
The fabulous Jeff Smith with the full version of the Trinity theme couple items for Trinity today no audio feedback

399
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,780
But a couple things I want to point out you don't have to go to the show notes to get the full load out on

400
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:31,260
This new fuel based on water of course. It's a kind of a hydrogen is a YouTube video

401
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,700
Which you just you've got to see this because this guy has developed something

402
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,420
That a fuel that comes out of water

403
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,380
And returns back to water so it sounds very much like a hydrogen process

404
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:48,300
But I'm not quite sure it's of course. It's a fox news report. So not only is it illegally on YouTube

405
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,980
So I hope it stays up there for a while

406
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:55,180
But also it's very shallow in in the reporting fair and balance perhaps but shallow for sure

407
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:01,660
But this guy also has a he has a government contract now to create hummers hybrid hummers

408
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,980
God that sounds like something from second life doesn't it a hybrid hummer

409
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:16,780
That runs on this water this water stuff and a hybrid of course with the with gasoline or maybe it's maybe it's a hummer diesel

410
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,980
I'm not too sure

411
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:22,220
So you've got to check that one out and a lot of people sent me that link and I appreciate it

412
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:29,980
Let's see here we hand another link which again go back to the show notes daily source code dot com

413
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,260
That biodiesel

414
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,260
This is from Portland, Oregon

415
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,260
Is now cheaper for the first time is cheaper than diesel

416
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,420
biodiesel company says as fuel is cheaper than regular diesel in Oregon for the first time

417
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:51,500
Sequential bio fuels is the leading biodiesel producer in Oregon the Portland based company says it's sold biodiesel for less than standard diesel last week

418
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:56,140
biodiesel has been selling about 20 to 30 cents per gallon more than standard diesel as of late March

419
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:00,140
But the blend known as b99 which means 99% biodiesel

420
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:06,620
1% standard fuel was selling for only two of was selling for two cents a gallon cheaper than standard diesel

421
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,340
on Monday when this

422
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,940
When this

423
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:15,020
Report was put out which I think is old actually I'm looking for a date here

424
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,260
That's pretty amazing

425
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,380
A new source without a date on it. Okay. Well, it doesn't matter

426
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:28,860
So but that is extremely good news, of course, and then just a thanks as you know go daddy has this

427
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:34,060
Number of promotions across a whole bunch of podcasts in the pod show podcast network and if you

428
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:39,980
One a domain name for $6.95 a pawn check out use the promo code DSC3

429
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,100
That's what Ian Stanley did and you said listening to your go daddy piece on

430
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,900
Was it delta share a try 359

431
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:51,740
You're talking about gifting domain names next thing. I know I find myself as browsing go daddy sites slow

432
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:57,740
During a slow lunch hour in a moment of triviality. I remembered your comment on gifting so he gave me

433
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,740
A gift

434
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:04,380
Trinity biodiesel.com currently redirects to the main daily source code site

435
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:09,420
This is so fantastic. It's a great idea by the way. It really is you know people get a whole kick out of

436
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,060
Receiving a domain name as a gift

437
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:15,900
So yeah, that's that's a bit of our Trinity segment for today

438
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:36,540
Time for some pod safe music. I'll read email about this one after the song Spanish artists from the pod safe music network

439
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,780
Reality

440
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,780
How's that for pronunciation

441
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,740
How

442
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,740
You

443
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,740
You

444
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,740
You

445
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,740
You

446
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,740
You

447
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,740
You

448
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:27,020
So I'm not to show with the Spanish pronunciation of Irene would be but her name is Irene

449
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:34,060
She's from Buckle on a Spain who's introduced the world of music at the tender age of six as I read here from the pod safe music network

450
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:41,180
She was raised on this into soul music. She stole from collections from her older cousins and this is her first demo a demo

451
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:49,820
Mutalia dots my rein you can find on the pod safe music network and if we can get through to her then we'll make it available for purchase today as well

452
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:55,740
And thank you very much coach food for sending in that suggestion if you have anything you find on the pod safe music network

453
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,740
You think it would be

454
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,900
Excuse me airball you think it would be appropriate for the Charlie please let me know

455
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,540
I just love playing that stuff really do

456
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:13,820
Hi, this is Phil and this is Tony from the soccer shout podcast

457

Subshad is the daily podcast that delivers a round up the best of British and European football

It's one part bar room discussion one part audio letters page

459
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,140
We're trying something a little bit different for the world cup and Germany this summer

460
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,900
We want to incorporate a ton of different voices and points of view into our show

461
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:36,540
We're appealing to bloggers and podcasts to get involved and contribute to the show and the ramp to the world cup and during the tournament itself

462
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:41,740
We're gonna put all of this together bring some really amazing coverage hopefully something a little bit unique in something

463
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:45,580
You won't find anywhere else during the summer's world cup in the process

464
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,100
We're gonna be showcasing some of the wonderfully talented bloggers and podcasts is out there

465
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
Explosant them to a wider audience of soccer fans

466
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:57,420
We're working hard on publicity have coverage on BBC radio and the UK Sunday times already lined up

I'm no BBC of course, but I hope I can contribute to getting you some listeners great idea and I did subscribe to the show

472
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,540
I'm not a sports fan. I'm you know

473
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:23,420
I listen to the skinny on sports of course because I love just a 10 minute here's what you need to know about sports

474
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,820
So I can be up on the most important stories of the day

475
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:32,380
Skinny on sports.com, but you know the soccer thing. I do get into that

476
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,180
I mean soccer is a pretty easy game to understand first of all and

477
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,860
There's a lot of ancillary politics and stuff that I don't get into but I

478
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:43,180
Can really get into it. Yeah, and I'm usually eroding for the the Dutch guys

479
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,380
You know the Dutch football soccer football players soccer players are

480
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,620
World renowned

481
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,460
Except when they play for the Dutch team and they all seem to suck. I'm not quite sure what's up with that

482
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,300
this year however

483
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:59,820
You know, I have just a real funny feeling that the United States has a shot and I most people expect them to be

484
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,940
Shut out in the semi finals or maybe even the quarter finals, but I just have this feeling, you know

485
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,460
It's it's been building for 20 25 years in the states and actually

486
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:13,020
Women's soccer is really catching fire, which I think is great as like hockey

487
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,020
And I love women's hockey field hockey too

488
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:19,180
Uh, it's not about the outfits and the aggression that really gets to me, but

489
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,820
I think the US has has a shot and I'm maybe playing uh, paying a lot of attention to it

490
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:28,140
This is definitely not a US event, you know, but this is our Super Bowl over here

491
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,660
And end the playoffs. Maybe it's like the NBA playoffs of course

492
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:38,140
I'm fortunate that the NBA playoffs are you know almost upon us so it kind of competes but if you can find it and I'm sure

493
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,860
These matches will be available

494
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:45,340
You know, grab a beer sit down take a look at a match. I'll let you know which one I think is going to be exciting

495
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:49,500
And then we'll find out what channels they're on the states and let's see if we can promote this a bit because

496
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:54,140
Even from a guy who just doesn't like sports and doesn't isn't interested in watching sports

497
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:59,500
You can really get into this and you know you've probably traveled to some country in Europe that you can

498
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,260
Or around the world outside of the US that you can root for if the US gets

499
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,780
Eliminated but watch him they got a strong team

500
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:11,260
Hey Adam, this is Jerry from anapolis. I was just listening to DFC

501
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,940
I think 394

502
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:20,060
The one with the interesting guy that you met at the conference you're the day

503
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:27,580
The climate perk as whatever was called yeah, I'm glad sure and you mentioned the bell and I I get you might even mention it

504
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,100
Briefly here in the minimum on your show. I just had to stop it and

505
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,620
Funniden real quick the deal about no bell is that

506
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,380
You didn't that dynamite is rich guy and

507
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:45,500
Oh, okay, right, so this was the conversation we're talking about why the Nobel Peace Prize is named after

508
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,060
Nobel

509
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,700
What was his first name Nick Nick Nobel

510
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:54,220
Who invented dynamite and so here is an answer?

511
00:42:54,220 --> 00:43:00,060
Today is a bituary prematurely made it to the newspaper and when he read it

512
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:06,460
It basically talked about how he was the inventor of this killer product dynamite and he decided

513
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,460
He did not want to be known

514
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,460
That we solely for that so he came up with the idea of

515
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,700
philanthropically

516
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,700
Supporting a peace prize

517
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,620
And that's the short history behind the Nobel Peace Prize

518
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:26,540
All right, well you show keep it up. All right, man later. Thank you very much. I'm I'm running so long on today show

519
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,820
I still have a couple things. I just have to play for you. They're like this from the past

520
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,860
Member Rob Caselo

521
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,860
If you're a long time Charlie this new you will

522
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,060
Says music here

523
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,700
It's got a message for you

524
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:46,140
Hey Adam hey Patricia this is Rob Caselo. I just wanted to thank you guys for your support

525
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,900
and keep doing what you're doing and I really appreciate

526
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:55,180
You taking the time and effort to support positive music and

527
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:01,900
Independent artists it's working and I don't even know my family now. I've fans all over the place

528
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:08,220
I'm getting constant emails especially from Europe all over Europe and being bombarded

529
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:13,820
With requests for sheep music so I finally did something about that and I put together sheep music for I do

530
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,380
That's available on my website now and

531
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,380
And

532
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:21,740
Want to think all my fans please keep writing and I'll write you back as I can

533
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,980
Not sure I'm gonna get out in the road and maybe soon maybe a couple of years

534
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:31,100
Who knows but I'm gonna keep making music and that's that's my main focus so I can reach all of you

535
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,580
Through podcasts and through the internet

536
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:38,060
Thanks again Adam and Patricia keep keeping up. Thanks

537
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:44,380
So if you never heard Rob Caselo's music I urge you to go to the pod safe music network at

538
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:49,100
Potset Music Network dot com or music dot pod show dot com check out what this guy does man

539
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,420
This was uh, but a year and a half ago when when he showed up on the scene in his music

540
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:57,820
It's just unbelievable instrumental beautiful piano pieces and now apparently also

541
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,620
Available in sheet music form which I think is

542
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,340
Probably the best way to share

543
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:10,220
Music if you're just talking outside of all media, you know, so that people can pick up this sheet of paper or

544
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,300
Retrieve it on the computer and and play it in their own version

545
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:18,060
I just do something about that and you're by the way it's still illegal to copy

546
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:23,420
lyrics and sheet music according to the publishers which just is a little bit beyond me. All right

547
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,380
I got one more song lined up and one more piece of feedback

548
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,540
Which pertains to something exciting happening this coming Saturday

549
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:35,500
Hey Adam, you love from what house radio aka what house radio on second life

550
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:39,180
Hey, sorry I missed you at the pajama party. I was there early, but I guess you uh

551
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:44,220
out there after I left I had to running take care of real life, but I wanted to share with you

552
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:49,260
I was listening to deathcast number five and willing to be whole what are you exciting thing is I got my golden ticket

553
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:54,460
And then later in the show heard you talking about possible components to the interface of second life

554
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:59,580
So I don't know between podcasting and second life and now the option of

555
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:03,260
Helping out with the development I need to find a way to quit my day job

556
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:09,100
Real life which is getting in the way so very excited about that and hope to just hear something

557
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:14,300
Then work on some stuff and great opportunity, but anyway, hope to see you in second life soon

558
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,140
Our new Patricia's with you, so you probably won't get there as much as you want to but

559
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:23,260
Been working hard developing stuff in there, so I want to show off a few things how to heal later

560
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:28,060
Bye bye. All right. So I've I've toned down my my

561
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,420
Presence on second life a lot

562
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:36,140
For number of reasons one is I'm a little tired of talking about it myself

563
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:43,020
Honestly, but you know as a reference as to people I meet there. It's fantastic because it still is it's just a meeting place for me

564
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,500
You know, it's a meeting place. It's a very powerful

565
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:50,780
Astmojo interface that you can do stuff with in PD love has really helped out a lot with our new meeting place

566
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:56,700
The pod show palace which will open up on Saturday and I will be there now I'm planning on going to visit my mom

567
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:02,220
Saturday and Sunday. So cleverly I'm staying overnight in a hotel with good broadband access

568
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,140
So I'll be able to be a part of this as well, but there's a whole bunch of people in second life who are

569
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,660
actually staffing this this event and

570
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:17,020
So opening times not quite sure something will be posted somewhere. I mean, this is this you have to spend so much time

571
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:25,420
So basically this thing is just gonna open up and there's gonna be DJs and and pots eight music artists and performances and lots of gambling

572
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:29,100
And PD love has actually helped out quite a bit with creating these fantastic

573
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:38,940
Fantastic what do you call them one arm bandits slot machines with all kinds of daily source code stuff on the spinning wheels

574
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:43,260
It's really it's it's amazingly cool. So I really appreciate that now

575
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:50,700
Some people don't really like the second life talk now. There's people don't like the airplane talk

576
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:55,900
There's people who don't like the Trinity talk. There's people who don't like the metro sexual moment talk

577
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:01,820
There's people who don't like me talking this people don't like Patricia talking this Pete there's always someone who doesn't like something on this show

578
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,260
And I've gotten pretty good about criticism

579
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,060
Particularly if the criticism is followed by

580
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:13,260
Something that builds up or suggestion etc and yeah, I get a lot of criticism

581
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:21,580
From listeners predominantly and I really appreciate that because the fact that you actually took the time to send me a message about something is great

582
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:25,740
Now that being said you can't please all of the people all of the time of course

583
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:28,860
But when the criticism comes from really close from someone

584
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:33,100
Maybe I respect even even more than others because I know the person

585
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:37,900
But when the criticism is is just about one particular topic and

586
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,380
Saying you I hate this it just

587
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,340
Unconstructive feedback

588
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:48,540
It is a little bit of twang there, you know, it's like oh that kind of hurts a little bit

589
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,780
And so if you listen to other podcasts and you send off

590
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,340
Feedback or criticism just reread the note twice

591
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:03,900
Or maybe three times before you send it off because it does make a difference whether it's from a listener or someone closer to home

592
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,500
It can it can hurt just a little bit

593
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,580
Particularly if it's just the I hate this, you know, or I don't like this or what

594
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:21,900
Folks who do podcasts, you know, it takes a long time. Yeah, it takes preparation. It's it's an art. It's not a science

595
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,700
You know, there's some science to it, but it's an art

596
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:30,300
It's it's trying to find the perfect mix trying to hit all the points that work for the audience

597
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,860
Taking that feedback and doing something with it, but you know, it sends something constructive not just

598
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:41,020
You know, I don't like this, you know, I hate this or stupid. We shouldn't do that or you know stuff like that doesn't help at all

599
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,860
And

600
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:51,020
Serendipity would have it that I received a suggestion for the song which would be the last one for today's show

601
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,220
We put the email here

602
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:56,220
It's just from

603
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,220
Long email actually

604
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:03,100
Simon Simon little hails and he turned me on to this artist

605
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,500
Kelly Mueller

606
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,740
Who's now on the pod safe music network and he convinced her

607
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,940
Number of months ago I presume

608
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:17,980
To actually add her music to the pod safe music network and of course, you know, I'm always like, oh, this is a great find, you know

609
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,740
No one will will have played this yet, and then I go I'm actually doing this as we speak going into the pod safe music network

610
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:31,260
And I see well, it's been played on the bald guy show night tiger the chill cast the manly geek show financial aid podcast random thoughts the F1

611
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:34,300
The one podcast journey inside my mind

612
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:40,860
Ticato urban podcast the world's li pod and cult pavilion, so I'm certainly not

613
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:42,860
one of the first people to play this

614
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,980
But it isn't artists from the UK

615
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:50,460
Her name is as I said Kelly Mueller. She's one of a very select group of singers

616
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:55,180
I'm reading from the bio now today. They use the piano and songwriting as a musical weapon of choice

617
00:50:55,900 --> 00:51:00,780
It has an added bonus that Kelly's crevacious figure alluring looks a natural blonde curls are

618
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:05,020
Pleasing to the eye and she's blessed with a four and a half octave soulful voice

619
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,980
Four and a half I mean couldn't we go to five it would have made so much sense

620
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,340
But when I listen to the song

621
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:17,100
I said I don't give a shit about the four and a half octave range the words of what hit me

622
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:24,060
Your words

623
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:41,740
You're toxic words I like rain to me and

624
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:52,220
Our eyes above them like a thirsty flower

625
00:51:52,380 --> 00:52:01,660
Drinking your words forcing me taller with every sin

626
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:09,580
Using each stroke to grow eyes

627
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:17,820
But I won't retaliate

628
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:23,580
I don't believe in hate

629
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:28,940
I would sooner drown the rain on you

630
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:35,740
But that doesn't stop you raining on me

631
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:43,260
Trip, drop, trip, drop, trip, drop, raining on me

632
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:54,540
Now you're intentional silence forms a cloud of a rain

633
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:07,180
Darkening my thoughts and forcing my mind to run wild

634
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,780
Your message is brutal

635
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:16,140
In your delivery is unkind

636
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:24,140
But I'll soak it up just to save your pride

637
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:32,300
Oh, but I won't retaliate

638
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:37,900
I don't believe in hate

639
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:43,180
I would sooner drown the rain on you

640
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:50,300
But that doesn't stop you raining on me

641
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:56,300
Evereword, you spill is a new tent

642
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,060
Am I trusting you?

643
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:04,060
Oh, you know I'm not waterproof

644
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:07,580
You keep testing, testing, testing, testing

645
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:15,740
Just to see if I drown

646
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:29,500
Trip, drop, trip, drop, trip, drop, trip, drop, trip, drop, trip, drop

647
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,300
I need you, me

648
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:40,060
Trip, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop!

649
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:49,340
I won't retaliate

650
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:54,380
I don't believe in hate

651
00:54:54,380 --> 00:55:04,380
I would sooner drown the rain on you

652
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:09,380
I won't die

653
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:14,380
I don't believe in hate

654
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:21,380
I would sooner drown the rain on you

655
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:26,380
But that doesn't stop you raining

656
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:31,380
Rain on me

657
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,380
Telling me you're from the pot-save music network

658
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:37,380
Your words keep raining on me

659
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:43,380
You can't stop, you won't stop

660
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:50,380
Rain on me

661
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,380
