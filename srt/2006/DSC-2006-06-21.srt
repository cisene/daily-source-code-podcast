You can buy, took a dome to my head, what a thing, what a high

35
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,000
Lying my hands, kicked up my feet, danced around, they got so sweet

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
A listen to the verse in, the music was a tree, it was a step on it

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Take my blues away, it's a morning

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's gonna be up, gotta stay, what a step on it

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's come so many times, me pour, I used to proud upon my life

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But I've got no too many gold, I've got gold

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Open up the paper, I start to be older, I've been pre-ins

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Rinse a bigger ounce or tiny in my eyes, of course, this is a myth

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Said it'd be the worst one, the top of the picture for the real

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's gonna be the worst one, the top of the picture for the real

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Take my blues away, it's a morning

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's gonna be up, gotta stay, what a step on it

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's come so many times, me pour, I used to proud upon my life

But I've got no too many gold

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I've got no too many gold

I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if it works, I don't know if

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:54,260
it works for you but give me that first day of summer feelin' it's lack strit, Wednesday morning, played several times beforeabouts of the Daily Source code, usually on a Wednesday, yeah, I wonder why.

52
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:06,060
Hey Kicks off, your Wednesday here, on the Charlie good morning everybody from Northern California another beautiful day, it is the first day of summer summer's solstice, of course celebrations took place, hours ago,

53
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:12,460
hours ago. That's all due to time difference in the United Kingdom where 25,000 people

54
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:19,340
were expected to show up at Stonehenge, including our very own pod chick. I think she had

55
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:24,540
or wasn't her wedding ceremony plan today, probably multiple wedding ceremonies, all kinds

56
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:31,580
of druids and believers and witches and goblins, all kinds of stuff shown up at Stonehenge.

57
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,900
Hopefully we'll get an update from the pod chick. She seemed pretty happy to be there.

58
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,340
And we're happy to be here San Francisco winding down my trip. It looks like I'm going to go back

59
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:50,780
on Saturday for a Sunday morning arrival and I'm ready for it. My goodness. Last night,

60
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,580
Miami Heat Champions. That was pretty incredible. Now you know, I've been following

61
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,180
what is happening to me? I used to be such a metro-sexual guy and now I'm following sports

62
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:06,060
like soccer and I'm even a little bit interested in hockey, even though it's over. I think

63
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,220
it was the only person in America interested in hockey. What went wrong there? How can we

64
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:16,140
don't care about hockey anymore in the US? But what a great game. Fantastic game last night to see the

65
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:23,740
heat versus the Mavericks and it was, you know, we watched it at 21st Amendment that's a bar

66
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:30,540
which is right next to the office conveniently located. Interestingly enough, I think we were the

67
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,220
Miami Heat fans in the place. The rest seemed to be for Dallas. But congratulations to the

68
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:42,540
Miami Heat. It was a great game and well-deserved win. Lots of stuff happening at the office. Of

69
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:48,540
course, that's why I'm here in San Francisco at Pod Show HQ. As we get ready for the full unleash

70
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:53,340
of Pod Show Plus. More about that in just a little bit. Actually, we'll do a metro-sexual moment

71
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,900
which has something to do with the release of Pod Show Plus. But we've got 50 people in the office now.

72
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:06,220
And you know what? We've crossed that point where I think I know everyone's name. It's

73
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,700
incredible. It's incredible to see how quickly this has grown and this is all based upon

74
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:17,100
business, upon revenue, upon being able to hire more people to do more things, which is

75
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:24,620
the way Ron and I have always operated companies. We've never had dot-com investments. And the

76
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:30,620
investment we have now was really most important part is getting all these incredibly

77
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,620
smart people on our board of directors and being able to utilize their experience.

78
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:42,140
The end of the roadodex is when appropriate. But we have contractors in as well working on some

79
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:48,300
specific projects. And as a tall person or as we say, as someone who was vertically challenged,

80
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,340
and that can go both ways obviously. Patricia is also vertically challenged, but in a different

81
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:59,740
direction. There's one thing, actually I should say, not just being a tall person, I'm six

82
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:05,980
four. If I stand up really straight, I probably just can scratch six five, but you get used to kind

83
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:11,820
of stooping down a little bit, particularly when you have a life partner who is five, three.

84
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,300
I think she says five four, but I think she's lying about that. We'll ask her a Monday when we do a

85
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,660
show together. The one thing you miss, particularly in a position I've been together for 20 years,

86
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:31,660
it's the hugging. You know, I like to hug. And it's complicated when you're of such a vast

87
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:38,380
different height. You can come up with all kinds of solutions. And we always find ourselves

88
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:43,820
me walking on the street Patricia walking on the sidewalk to get that little extra lift or you know,

89
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:49,660
we use stairs or we use anything we can. We have some tall people showing up at the office now

90
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:56,620
who we're working with as a pod show here in San Francisco. Lisa is a contractor and Lisa's great,

91
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:02,460
because Lisa is, she's got to be six feet tall. She may even be taller. I'm not sure.

92
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:10,460
And we were talking about this the other day and her fiance is a little bit, not much,

93
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,660
which is a little bit shorter than she is. And I say, you know, Lisa, there's just one thing.

94
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:21,740
Um, could I hug you? And there's something about a hug hugging someone who was of equal height

95
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:29,260
of you that it just cannot be compared. And the reason I say this is because watching the heat

96
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:36,700
last night, I remember, oh man, this must have been 11 years ago, maybe, interestingly enough,

97
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,900
with many of the same people that I'm with now, Ron and actually this was with the KJ Chris Jacob.

98
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:49,100
We, uh, we built planet rebox.com, which was rebox, um, website. It was one of very early in the

99
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:57,020
game. There was 94, 94, 95. And we do all kinds of events and we go to the Super Bowl and we do

100
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:02,460
cybercast and we do interviews. And at the time, Shack had just signed up with rebox for his, uh,

101
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:09,100
his humongous literally, humongous shoe, uh, shoe deal. And, uh, so we, I think we went to a

102
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,100
camera if it wasn't land. It feels like it wasn't at land, but I'm not sure we went to interview

103
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,980
and, and I said to Shack that Shack, excuse me, uh, could I just hug you for a moment? And that was

104
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,340
probably the best hug I've ever had to hug this huge thing that was bigger than me. It was just

105
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:31,980
the, and you know, I could kind of just kind of melt away in his arms. Man, that guy is huge,

106
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:38,620
diesel, brought it home. I, uh, made a call to Uncle Don yesterday. Now, for those of you who haven't

107
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,380
heard the episode where I talked about Uncle Don when I was in New York, Uncle Don, who is my

108
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:51,980
uncle? Um, I see, uh, he's married to my dad's sister. Uh, he has a long standing, uh, relationship

109
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:57,580
with the US government. He was, uh, uh, I'm, I'm not sure, you know, I have to ask him because I keep

110
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:05,100
forgetting I probably muck it up, but, uh, I think he ran either the NSA or portions of the CIA

111
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:13,420
many years ago. He was, uh, security advisor to, uh, Bush senior when he was VP. He was, uh,

112
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:18,220
and this is probably the most, uh, interesting thing. He was ambassador to South Korea for a number of

113
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:24,860
years. And, uh, for the past, I think, five or six, maybe, maybe even longer than that, maybe eight

114
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:31,260
years. He's been the chairman CEO of the Korea Society. And that's, headquartered in New York City.

115
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,300
So with, uh, with, uh, you know, all this talk of missiles being fueled up and things heating

116
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,500
up in North Korea, I figured time to call Uncle Don because we got to get him on the show.

117
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,220
And, uh, and, and I, you know, I really wanted to do an, uh, uh, in person to interview with him

118
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,740
because I felt that that would just, it would be much better, but you know, shoot. I'm ready for, uh,

119
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:59,500
for a Skype call. So I called, uh, spoke to Aunt Meg and, uh, guess what, Uncle Don is in

120
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:06,940
Seoul, Korea right now. Gee, it's not a coincidence. And this guy is, uh, he's, uh, he's, uh, he, he's

121
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,980
important. I, I know that, uh, some, uh, maybe he won't ever be able to tell me or us about what

122
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,940
he's doing, but I know that he's, he's, uh, heavily, he knows the Koreans so incredibly well,

123
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:22,940
South and North, if, as if there's a real difference in the people. Um, and I know that he's over

124
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:29,340
there doing good stuff. And I know that he's extremely concerned about North Korea. So,

125
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,020
uh, obviously not able to get through to him in Seoul and there's all kinds of time, time zones,

126
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:41,180
issues, etc. Uh, but, um, I did get an email back from him after talking on Meg and, uh, anywhere

127
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:45,740
before July 12th, he'll be more, uh, after he gets back. So he gets back this Sunday, I guess. So

128
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,860
sometime next week, I'm going to give him a call and we'll just do a Charlie talking Uncle Don.

129
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,820
And you're going to love this guy. You are going to love him. Well, uh, when you hear his stories

130
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:01,980
and when you hear his insights and, and he's, he really knows what's going on. So I'm excited about

131
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,700
that. It's going to be very cool to have Uncle Don on the show. It's a family affair once again.

132
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,780
Hey, what's up, Adam, this Jersey Todd. And I just want to play you something from yesterday's

133
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:20,060
chat chat. It's from my personal Charlie music colleges. Jersey Todd from the Jersey Todd show.

134
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,380
Jersey Todd show.com. Dude, thank you so much for turning me on to this.

135
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:29,260
Daisy Cutter featuring Uncle Keith. Cool Keith. That is a big deal as, uh, Jersey Todd said

136
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:34,860
in his email to me. So listen, the official musicologist of the Charlie, I don't know. I

137
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,780
thought last month, I was the official solicitor, a lawyer of the daily source code. I don't know.

138
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,380
I've got more titles than the New York Public Library. But listen, that's not the reason I'm

139
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,620
checking in. The song you played yesterday. Daisy Cutter. That's actually recorded by seven

140
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,980
Ellen Esoteric Adam Massachusetts. Cool Keith, or as I like to call him Dr. Octagon himself,

141
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,300
apparently helped out with the track. And if you're not familiar with cool Keith, his sound and his

142
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:01,580
wordplay is all over that song. Seven Ellen Esoteric's new album is being released on June 27th on

143
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:06,780
Baby Grand Records. And you can check out some other tracks from them on the PMN. Now listen,

144
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:11,420
I'm not going to cheap in this audio comment with a cheap plug for my show, the Jersey Todd show.

145
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:16,300
In fact, I think that daily source code listeners are computer savvy and enough to find

146
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,420
it themselves. And I think it would cheapen the office of the official musicologist of the Charlie

147
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:29,100
for me to say my website addressed. All I'm going to say is that it's exactly the same as www.google.com,

148
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,340
except instead of Google, you should put something else in there. Hey, it's Jersey Todd and the Jersey

149
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:40,060
Todd Show, and I'll catch you on the flip side. Oh, man. A lawyer with a sense of humor. I love it.

150
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,260
Dude, we got to work on on your presentation skills there, okay?

151
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,300
Because if you're if you're an attorney and you're the your the official musicologist and you

152
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,180
got to be like a denny crane thing, man. Jersey Todd, that's what we need from you.

153
00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:00,220
Jersey Todd, here for you protecting the interests of the Charlie listeners.

154
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:14,300

161
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,260
Yeah, it's just I think you had an audio comment that went along with this where he said

162
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,940
uh maybe it was an email I can't remember. A little fuzzy this morning. It's Wednesday morning.

163
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,820
I always said, oh, you may not be in the mood for playing this promo. It's about the Mac. I know

164
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:00,140
you hate the Mac. It's like whoa, step back for a second. I don't hate anything. You know,

165
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:05,980
I still love Macs. I've got my eye Mac right here. I've got Patricia's got an eye Mac at home.

166
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,780
It's just the power books or the ones that are freaking me out. That's all, you know, and

167
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:16,220
power books I need to portable. I need a portable. That's going to be reliable and and yeah,

168
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:22,460
reliable. That's about it. And I just really frustrated with with the quality. I think of the hardware

169
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:28,380
more than anything with the with Macs right now, you know. And everyone said, oh, you should buy

170
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,860
a Macbook Pro or buy a Macbook. You know, this is what you need. You can even run Windows on it.

171
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:39,500
Yeah, I understand. I totally understand. But I'm glad I didn't because I've been reading up a

172
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,660
little bit on what's going on with the with the Macbooks and the MacBook Pros and we have, you know,

173
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:49,260
all kinds of things like overheating because of a plastic strip that was left in in the in the

174
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:54,940
casing. I've heard that Wi-Fi. In fact, I read Jason Kelcanus was having problems with his MacBook Pro.

175
00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:01,660
And he and he's getting a little bit protrude, if you will. Because though the apparently there

176
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:08,300
was a series of MacBook Pros with a Wi-Fi is flaky and and then there's a a wine. Oh, man,

177
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:13,580
the screen wine. I've had that on an old laptops and all kinds of computers, essentially. But

178
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:18,220
then it's basically the screen. When you turn it up to a certain brightness, then it starts to wine.

179
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:25,820
It's like, no, this, you know, that's like buying a Bentley and hearing, you know, something

180
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:32,860
knocking is that's horrible. It's that does not make you feel good. So if that stuff gets fixed,

181
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,580
you know, it's again, it's it doesn't really matter to me. I just want something that's actually

182
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:43,180
it does matter to me because I when I took the the power book into the shop yesterday to have

183
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:49,580
David at the HQ take care of it. I was like, man, this thing is heavy. I mean, I mean, kind of

184
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,580
tooling around with the portage, which is like two pounds or something. It's it's a very,

185
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,940
very nice light machine to really use on your lap. You know, no fried nuts or anything like that.

186
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:07,020
It's good. Something amazing happened to me yesterday, my friends. Something completely amazing.

187
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:14,860
As you know, England played Sweden. Now, in the world cup finals, football or soccer, as you will.

188
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:21,260
And the history of this is very much like the like the Miami Heat actually, Miami Heat had never

189
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:28,220
beat the Mavericks on Mavericks home turf. England has never been able to beat Sweden for 47

190
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:34,300
years. They've not been able to beat Sweden. And gosh, I wish I was there because England really

191
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,700
got into it this time. Everyone was having Swedish meatballs for dinner and we were going to go

192
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:44,380
kicked their ass. We were going to win. And it was a fantastic game. Of course, I didn't see the game

193
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:49,900
because I was at the office. It started. I think it noon. Some people at the office showed up much

194
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:56,540
later in the day. I wonder if they were watching the match Richard Brewer. But that's okay. I completely

195
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,820
understand. What was interesting, though, is I was in meetings. And I kept getting text messages

196
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:07,900
from Patricia. She was actually sitting home watching the game and she was totally into it and

197
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:12,860
she was giving me the score. And she was telling me, oh, now Rune's playing and Beckham looks cute.

198
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:20,220
Oh, and there's another goal. And this is not my wife. I'm like, what is going on? She does not

199
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:27,420
watch these things. So I don't know if it's the England spirit that's kicked in. I mean,

200
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:32,940
my mother-in-law. Yeah, I mean, she watches football religiously and to have her text me with the

201
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:39,180
score, I would completely expect. But have Patricia do it. I was blown away. She was really

202
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:45,340
really into it. I can't wait to get home to see this new woman of mine. I really can't.

203
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:51,580
Hello, Adam. This is Brad Gunter from Berlin. Come back a whole new source of the

204
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:57,100
good soccer football team. Dude, you sound like you're in a freaking dungeon. You'll see if I can

205
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,340
filter you to make your sound better as is really horrible. Problems in having it trying to get out

206
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:07,180
the right way to say it. Um, they're not producing it from a German magazine that was about

207
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:12,460
since it will come here all the, there's magnets in there. Rep dude, would you send that to me again

208
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,700
because you had a really good piece there and it sounded much better when I was previewing it

209
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,700
before the show, but now I can't hear a single word you're saying. It was about the difference between

210
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:29,500
soccer and football and that actually he says soccer is the appropriate term for the game

211
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:36,380
because well he has some kind of explanation for it. But it stems back to the 19th century when we had

212
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:45,580
basically rugby and soccer. But I disagree. I think I think football is football. In fact in Europe,

213
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,220
we say American football when we're talking about football in the States, which is fine. I think

214
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,780
so I don't like soccer. I don't like the name at all. Football is really what it is. You play the

215
00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:02,940
ball with your feet. In fact, you get penalized if you play it with your hand. It's too bad about that.

216
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,860
Sorry. Hey, we haven't done this in a real long time.

217
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,580
Yeah. So I guess the only thing really to talk about well there's two things for the

218
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:34,700
Metro sexual moment. On today's episode, it's this beard thing. Now I made a very bold statement yesterday

219
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:40,700
saying that I would grow my beard until we released or unleashed Potso Plus in public data.

220
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:48,940
Whoa. I've never really really let my my my facial hair grow to any extent. I mean it may be

221
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:55,660
over the weekend or something or maybe three days at most, but it really itches when it gets

222
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,860
much longer. And and I think it's starting to look kind of scraggly. So I need some advice

223
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:06,540
instead of me giving you advice. I definitely need some advice on how do I maintain this?

224
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,700
You know, how do I make it not look? Well, I guess part of the point is for me to look like a total

225
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:17,500
to weave by growing this beard until until we unleash. But does anyone have any recommendations for

226
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,620
tools to use? I mean, all I keep thinking of is that they used to have that Don Johnson like

227
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:29,500
shaver so you could still keep your stubble going. Should I be clipping it over the sink?

228
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,940
Which is to scum a dad used to do that. And I hate it. So discussing, but it itches and how long

229
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:41,820
will it take before the itching stops? Now you probably see in the album art for today,

230
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,780
for this podcast, and this was a great, I hope you had me who suggested this to me the other day.

231
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:51,980
Someone said, hmm, I try to think who it was. Well, anyway, someone suggested that with each podcast,

232
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:57,340
as the beard grows, instead of the the normal pod father picture that shows up in your

233
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:02,540
player or in your iTunes or your iPod or wherever you happen to be listening to this show,

234
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:09,580
we'll stick in a picture of the growth of the beard. Which of course means we can

235
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,060
dedicate an entire show to shaving it off once we're out and we're unleashed. One other thing,

236
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:19,260
this is from Ole Christian, Christian Valle. I think that's how you pronounce it. This was a

237
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:24,460
comment. It wasn't email. I think it was an email. Apparently in the catfish show,

238
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:29,500
which you can find at catfishshow.com, there's a conversation ongoing about women using men's

239
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:34,060
deodorant and why they do. Is this true ladies? And I know you're listening to the metro sexual

240
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:40,940
moment. Do you use male deodorant and why? Isn't that stuff supposed to be pH balance for us

241
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:51,980
and not for you? Inquiring minds, need to know. Yesterday, Roger Smalls had some questions about

242
00:23:51,980 --> 00:24:01,100
sleep. And let me see, can I still make this? Oh crap, yeah, I'll play it now. Because he asked Uncle

243
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:08,060
Jesse our satellite repairman, you know, P-Dub to come up with some answers as to how we can stop

244
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:15,100
falling asleep. Hello, Roger. Uncle Jesse here. I understand you're having some trouble with

245
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:20,860
elective energy and falling asleep on the couch at night. Two things that I have a great deal of

246
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:29,980
experience with worry no more. The solution is awfully simple, Roger. Here is the easiest solution

247
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:38,300
to sleeping too much. Simply, schedule an important meeting. I'm sorry, let me start that over.

248
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:45,900
Simply, schedule an important meeting. Something that will affect your entire existence for

249
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:53,980
800 the next day. Hopefully, at some location there will be a lengthy commute. Then,

250
00:24:54,620 --> 00:25:01,980
every time you even think about sleeping, recall that you have this important appointment in

251
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:10,860
the morning. I guarantee you won't sleep even a minute during the night. However, be really careful

252
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:16,460
in the shower that morning. It's going to be really interesting to see if P-Dub puts that

253
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:22,860
entire comment on the on the serious show. I kind of slide it right over the over the window there.

254
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,620
Sorry about that P-Dub. Timing is everything I guess. If you have a question,

255
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,180
if you need something answered, if you need advice, there's only one man you need to go to.

256
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,180
The satellite repairman. He takes care of it all.

257
00:25:53,740 --> 00:26:03,580
The satellite repairman. Thank you so much. Everyone who's helping us change advertising by

258
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:10,140
submitting your own version of a commercial for Earthlink, who are of course sponsors of the

259
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:15,740
P-Dub podcast networks, fantastic the way this is going. Essentially, we're putting our money

260
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,700
and Earthlink's money. Happy to do that. We're putting that where your mouth is,

261
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:26,060
which means you get to create the messaging. What's the best way to tell listeners of this

262
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:31,820
program? I'm not even talking about all podcasts. Maybe this podcast, which is why I'm playing

263
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:38,940
submissions here, want people who are listening to this show. How do we communicate the message?

264
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:45,180
What is the best way to do it? Are there more creative ways than the traditional commercial?

265
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:51,980
Well, it turns out there are. If you go to adchalance.podshow.com, you can submit your

266
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:59,180
commercial, your endorsement, any type of audio you want really, as long as it's conveying the message

267
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:04,060
of Earthlink, and I would have to say, as long as it's truthful in conveying the message of Earthlink,

268
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,700
which is what really seems to work best. You can win $2,000.

269
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:15,420
Yes, great cash prizes. It's all part of our quit your day job program. It's not all that much for

270
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:20,060
a quit your day job, but damn, it's a start. Let's see how clear I can make this.

271
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:32,860
And this is what my voice sounds like. With Earthlink's true voice, the internet phone service

272
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:41,340
from the internet experts. Let your voice speak for itself. Go to earthlink.net today to hear your

273
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,140
true voice.

274
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:51,340
Yeah, I love it. If only all phone calls sounded like that. Could you also make it Earthlink so that

275
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,700
when people call me, they actually just chirp like birds? Oh, be so beautiful.

276
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,260
Brandon, some problems yesterday with cash blast, I told you about having the, hey, I'm still

277
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:05,580
learning all this PC stuff. Had, had, had used cash blasts, they're on an extended desktop.

278
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,300
So a secondary screen at the office and when I got home and I fired a cash blaster, a cash

279
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:16,860
blaster was still on the secondary screen. Only the screen was turned off. And the desktop,

280
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,740
extended desktop was turned off. So it was somewhere on the edges of my screen in cyberspace.

281
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:26,220
And I was, you know, I had to wheel the mouse over and try and figure out how to, you know,

282
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:32,300
where I was on cash blaster was I able to click on the, on the title bar and drag it over. And thank

283
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:39,420
you so much, everyone who sent in comments, a lot of email about how to actually move windows

284
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,980
when this happens. So first of all, it is an application error. Because I think it's something

285
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:49,020
the program itself can check when it starts up and cash blaster mic emailed me immediately,

286
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,900
laughing out loud, of course, and said, hey, man, I fixed it. So that will never happen again.

287
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:59,820
So we'll see that in the future release. Apparently, see who sent me this one. This was Shawn

288
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:05,740
Nichols. Right click on the button in the task bar for the application, select move. Now here,

289
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,860
this is the part that I didn't get. Then you can move the window with the, with the arrow keys.

290
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:16,540
duh. If only I'd known that one. So you could, of course, can also do it with the mouse, which is

291
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:22,780
what I had done. But if you select move, oh, you can also select move and then the mouse gets like

292
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:28,380
crosshairs. But it's a lot easier to use the arrow keys. Yeah, a lot of these shortcuts

293
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,020
I haven't quite figured out yet. And you know what I still really, really miss. I really missed

294
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:38,540
the Apple key H command. Wow, I noticed how much I used to use that just to hide an application

295
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:44,460
real quick to get back to the desktop. And I do use the, what is it window start key and D,

296
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,820
which will take you to the desktop and move all the other windows out of the way. But a hide

297
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:53,420
command would be highly appreciated. Hi Adam. This is Jim Farley. And today, while listening

298
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:58,700
to the Charlie, you gave me a great idea. It was during the Earthling Prima that you played.

299
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,820
You see the guy mentioned that Earthling was donating band with to hurricane survivors.

300
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:10,300
Well, I started thinking about that. You see, I wrote a song after Katrina because my

301
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:15,340
daughter and her husband lost their home and slide Eloiseana to the hurricane and they had come

302
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:22,060
to live with us here in Ohio. That's when it hit me. If you can arrange it somehow that my song

303
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:28,300
Katrina is set up to be purchased on the pod safe music network, I would donate my entire portion

304
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:34,540
to hurricane relief. My daughter and her husband are doing fine, but there are so many others

305
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:39,260
that still need our help. And I'd like to do more than what I've been doing for them by trying

306
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:44,140
to generate some real money for the cause. And the pod show listeners have proven that they can

307
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:50,700
get behind something like this with cancer and other worthwhile causes. So what say you Adam,

308
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:57,020
is this something that's even plausible? I'd like to think so. And any dollars that we can put into

309
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:02,140
the hands of the people who need it in that area, not the government's slippery little fingers,

310
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:09,260
is immensely helpful. I know this firsthand. You can find Katrina along with my other songs on the

311
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:15,900
pod safe music network. Can we do this? Well, what say you was the question? I say, yeah, of course

312
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:22,060
we can. In fact, every single pod safe song that we play on the Charlie, as a part of our rolling

313
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:30,940
unleash is made available for purchase. That is if the artist wants it to be made available for

314
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:37,420
purchase. So in this case, it's clear you do. Let me just get the song cranking while we're talking

315
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:43,020
here. So great news. It's Christmas years in the office all this week. So we're on the same

316
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:50,700
time zone and he'll be certain to contact you to make that available for purchase. And I have to say,

317
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:56,380
it's instrumental piece, but it's beautiful. And I can just see the images that you go along with this.

318
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:03,340
So I would suggest video artists out there want you to give a stab at really making this play into

319
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,340
something multimedia. Listen to the song. It's beautiful. You can just see the images

320
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,980
flashing before you.

321
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:39,660
music

322
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:55,580
Now, I'm not much of a videographer, but hearing that, I immediately want to run over to

323
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,700
well, used to be Final Cut Pro. Now, of course, it's Adobe Premiere. Now, I'm on Windows.

324
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:06,460
I want to go edit some video to that beautiful man. So, Christmas years will get in touch with you.

325
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:10,940
And we'll set that up. And ping me from time to time. Let me know how it's going and remind me.

326
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:16,540
And I'll play it again. And the best reminder, of course, is if we get some cool videos associated

327
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:20,220
with that, that'd be great. And you know what? We'll definitely raise some money. It happened,

328
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:25,820
you know, look at what we did with the MS Walk for the Bitties. I mean, it was like over $20,000.

329
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:33,980
It was unreal. Yeah, we got a lot of power here. Speaking of power, I promise to once and a while

330
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:39,340
explain what this whole sense of thing burp is about. Because there are lots of new listeners who

331
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:45,740
come in and they hear me burp. And then they hear me say sense to him. And they're wondering what

332
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:52,940
that's all about. This is something that we started, oh man, must be a year ago by now. And it was

333
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:57,820
really just a simple test and advertising test. I think with the conversation at the time on daily

334
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:04,300
source code was about advertising. And, you know, I truly believe that the way mainstream

335
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:09,420
advertising works is through repetition. It's how we elect our presidents. You know, if you

336
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,780
you have $200 million worth of advertising dollars to spend, you can, you have a pretty good

337
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:19,420
shot at becoming president of the United States. I hate to say it, but that's just the way it is.

338
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:25,260
You know, people buy different soap powder based upon commercials, stuff they can see over and

339
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:30,380
over and they can sing the jingle and they can, you know, they know the joke of the spot on TV.

340
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:35,500
And it's repetition. It really does work. But it's also a part of anchoring or neurolinguistic

341
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:40,140
programming, or perhaps somewhat called the Vulcan mind trick. And it started, it didn't even

342
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,060
start off with a burp. It started off where I asked you listeners to pick a point. I'm not going to

343
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:48,460
do it now. I'm not going to, I'm not going to program your mind right now. But, you know, there was a

344
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,700
situation. I said, pick a point, look at it, and then if then I would say Sanseo, and then

345
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,940
whenever you went past that point, you wouldn't be able to help think, but think of Sanseo,

346
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:02,140
kind of like a virtual billboard. And I was getting people saying that every single time they

347
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:08,220
moved the lawn and went past a particular bush, they would think of Sanseo. And then I can't

348
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:13,500
remember how we morphed over to the burp, but it just happened. And by the way, Sanseo pays me

349
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:19,820
nothing for this. I'm just a lover of the product. They should, though, man. Damn, they should.

350
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:27,980
Anyway, so it's just kind of an out of hand advertising experiment. But this stuff is working

351
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:34,620
in very, very strange ways. In fact, the lighter clicks at the end of the show, people now tell

352
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:39,020
me that whenever they see or whenever they hear a lighter click, they think of the daily source code.

353
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,860
And you may think they're strange, but when you really think through it, it makes a lot of sense.

354
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:49,420
And I got to come up with more of these things because, well, I'm actually influencing

355
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:56,940
people's bodies now. Hi, Adam. It's Adros from Potsworth here. A little story of what happened to

356
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:04,140
me when I was in Asda, the supermarket shopping today. I got to the coffee bowl and saw the Sanseo

357
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:09,980
and said Sanseo and burps. Just like that. I didn't need to burp before. It just said the words

358
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:18,140
and about came out. Something very, very powerful in what you're doing, isn't it? But that is

359
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:24,140
its powerful asmojo, man. I'm telling you. So, okay, everyone pay attention. Sanseo,

360
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:31,900
how many of you burped? Hey, Adam. This is Travis Goss. The host and executive producer of

361
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:39,340
the Ungradio show. And, well, I need me a little bit of help here. No, I've asked for help a lot

362
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:45,900
times for me and really didn't get much of anything. So, whenever you have a sense say a moment,

363
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,220
can you plug the Ungradio show? You've done it for Don Drew and everybody else. When you have

364
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:56,460
a sense say a moment. So, what about me? You know, I've been a listener to yours since episode

365
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:02,540
3-4-2. I know I'm a late bloomer right here. Better late than never. But, you know, hey,

366
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:08,220
this whenever you have a sense say a moment, take of me because, walk quite frankly, the numbers

367
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:16,620
haven't low this month. You know, these were a listening feeling a little bit insecure of myself

368
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:23,660
and, you know, I need to know that I matter. I mean, it's no that the show or that I have

369
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:30,860
is going to be doing just well. So, I said say a moment, probably be very uplifting and make

370
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:37,660
going people want to listen because whenever you have a sense say a moment, it's like a golden hand

371
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:45,980
touches something that was once dead and brings it back to life. Oh yes. Okay, that was where you

372
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:50,860
were done. Yeah, that made it very frightening. But anyways, hey, make me help me out since

373
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:55,420
day and moment. You know, in a radio show, we're on iTunes, podcast alley. We even have an online

374
00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:02,700
shop now, which can be found at cafepress.com slash on radio shop. We got t-shirts, I had,

375
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:13,820
button, even got a teddy bear. So, how about it? Yeah, how about it? Well, you got your plug there,

376
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,020
my friend. I don't have to burp. I'm sorry. I don't know what it is. There's no burp

377
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:22,940
just today. I'll just go back to the video again for Katrina. We met some guys, actually a

378
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:29,180
methamenpebble beach when we were at the Clienter Perkins conference from this company called

379
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:36,460
onetruemedia.com and I had heard of them before and hadn't really paid attention to what they

380
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:43,660
were doing. And actually I played golf. I remember I had the horrendous 14 holes

381
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:49,100
of golf. Where everyone hid behind the cart when I was teeing off. So, Mark from onetruemedia

382
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:55,500
came to the office yesterday with John CEO of the company. Wow, man, where are we a match

383
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:01,020
mate in heaven? This is beautiful stuff. You should check it out because they have an online

384
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:07,900
video editing tool. Now, they say they have at least another year, maybe two years of development,

385
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,940
you know, to really get all kinds of great effects and stuff. But, um, and I was a little bit

386
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:17,420
skeptical about it until I tried it out. In fact, I will try to do something with the Katrina

387
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:25,020
video myself today. Basically, you just upload video and then you can edit the video, the sequence,

388
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:29,980
you can put pictures in, you can add different sound. A very, very simple and effective way to

389
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:36,460
yeah, to basically mix and mash and create a video. And, of course, what we talked about is

390
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:42,700
hooking it up to the podcast delivery network. Very similar, in fact, to what a cast blast

391
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:48,300
does for audio. So, um, you should check that out and go take a look at it and, uh, let me know what

392
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,540
you think. And, well, you'll let me know what you think by sending something in or not or creating

393
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:57,180
something for the Katrina, Katrina video. Not just another piece of the stuff. We'll have every

394
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:01,820
single day, there's a new piece of opportunity. And, for the first time in quite a while,

395
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:09,500
it seems like the comments on curry.com are synchronizing with the audio on the daily source code.

396
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:16,860
Yeah, everything's kind of going in parallel now. And the whole impetus for this is that I was talking

397
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:22,940
about getting a Sony Vio laptop. Now, there are many different models and versions,

398
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:29,660
all very complicated letters and number combinations. But essentially, Ron and I decided it was best

399
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:34,700
if, uh, if I got the same one he has, which is a high-end one. It doesn't really matter to me.

400
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:40,140
I just want a faster processor. Um, but the reason, of course, is so that I can be his help desk,

401
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,980
which I've been for 12 years now. So, I'm used to it. I don't mind. Because if I say, hey, you know,

402
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:50,700
that thing that's not working on our computers, how do I fix that? Um, but apparently, the fact

403
00:42:50,700 --> 00:43:00,300
that it's made in Japan has rubbed someone the wrong way. Comic strip. Comic strip. Comic strip.

404
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:06,940
Comic strip. Comic strip. Comic strip.

405
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:14,860
Check it out what he has to say. All hail. So, I don't carry. Do you care about Wales? No,

406
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:22,300
I don't mean those ship shaggers, who is the only ethnic group in UK, preserved the original

407
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:27,660
Celtic language. Do you got to be so careful when you say comic strip blogger? I mean Wales.

408
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:34,380
Those big fees that are mamas. Since you and your boyfriend, your own bloom,

409
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:39,900
use now Japanese notebooks. And you want to buy new Japanese notebook. Maybe you and

410
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:47,100
whole where it should know that Japanese won't kill Wales by forcing small nations, even those

411
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:54,300
without access to flipping sea to vote for a resuming of where hunting. Japanese are succilling

412
00:43:55,180 --> 00:44:04,220
if you care about Wales, you shouldn't buy Japanese products. So, do you really care about Wales?

413
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:13,660
Or about other issues that bother all those three hugging hippies from Greenpeace? I don't think so.

414
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:21,500
Proof me wrong. By playing this audio comment. Anyway, here you like the podcast creator.

415
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:27,100
It was all over the news last night. I have to admit, right on topic there.

416
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:33,500
Even the Daily Show had a whole bit on what Japan is. I haven't read into the material and I've

417
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:40,380
learned long ago not to form an opinion based upon what you see on television, essentially.

418
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:46,700
I think that that may be going a little bit too far to boycott the Sony.

419
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:52,780
Sony owns most of America, dude, in case you didn't know. Now, I'm not to share about the

420
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:59,100
whale issue, but I will certainly look into it. Hello, I'm calling from Wales. I figured that

421
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:04,860
since as a recent convert to your show, I give it a shot and see what you thought of a real

422
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:10,220
Welsh accent. So, from South Wales can be packed in my cafe again and present, waiting to go and see

423
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:15,820
a film. Can't you say go to watch it? And I'm absolutely bursting for a pee. Anyway, there has

424
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,460
a said in a recent convert and I kind of like the show, I think. It's the only reason why I

425
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:24,620
stayed behind to save a clock and work so they can download the show until I knock you and then

426
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:30,780
have a listen while I'm going down the M4. So, you look after yourself, hello to everyone and bye-bye.

427
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:38,140
Happy pudding, see you all. Happy pudding back at you. That's the real whales. It's pretty interesting

428
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:44,940
how they, I believe that the use of the Welsh is it a language or is it dialect? I'm not quite sure.

429
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:48,620
It's, you know, the more and more people are starting to speak it. I wouldn't mind learning a

430
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:52,620
little bit. There's a couple of Welsh podcasts and believe me, we'll be featuring those when we

431
00:45:52,620 --> 00:46:00,780
unleashed in the UK as well. I've learned one thing about the UK. People do not want the impression

432
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:05,180
that, you know, all the good stuff comes from London and there's a lot of good stuff that does

433
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:10,460
not come from London in the UK. A lot of great football does not come from London in the UK.

434
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:17,580
So, we're definitely learning a lot about, I'm learning a lot about the diversity of the

435
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:23,580
country. I got to make a few trips, man. I got to fly around in the UK. Let that be high on the

436
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:29,100
agenda for the next couple of weeks when I'm back at the cottage. I'll drum up Jason who'll be

437
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:34,700
my safety pilot for who is my safety pilot for inland flights and we'll fly to some other places.

438
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:39,500
Maybe we'll meet some people. I got to learn more about this country. Seeing as I live there and

439
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:48,620
have the time. Two things that have been raging in the debate in the blogosphere.

440
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:56,380
Let's see, I don't know if you read about this story, the world intellectual property organization

441
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:04,460
is trying to pass some legislation. Now, here's the story as it's kind of being paraphrased

442
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:11,660
in reporting on the internet. I did take the time to go to the world into the weepo. Weepo,

443
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:16,380
the world intellectual property organization, and read the actual proposal, which was man,

444
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:24,060
Jersey Todd helped me out. This thing was so full of legalese. It wasn't funny.

445
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:29,180
So, the way it's been and I think I understand it now. What is being reported on now and there's a petition?

446
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:36,780
There's a podcast of petition, in fact. You can find that, I'll put a link in the show notes.

447
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:44,780
There's a petition that was a couple of podcast guilds and I didn't know that there was,

448
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:50,540
I knew there was the UK podcast association or guild or something, but there's one in Germany

449
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:53,500
and there's a couple other from around the world. They've come together and they said,

450
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:58,860
we have to stop this legislation. Now, basically, the reason why people are crying,

451
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:05,820
follow over this is because there is a secondary effect that this legislation could have and

452
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:12,460
then I want to talk about what I think the legislation is really for. In effect, this legislation

453
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:20,380
says is that if a television, I'll just take the simplest example. If a television network,

454
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:33,180
broadcasts anything, regardless, even if they use the snippet in fair use as a news item,

455
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:41,340
a snippet of the daily source code, they would, in effect, own that. So, the transmission of that,

456
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:50,060
they will own anywhere on broadcast television, on radio, but also on the internet for 50 years.

457
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:56,540
So, you know, it's clear that, well, it's clear that that is a huge issue when it comes to

458
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:05,260
pod save music, you know, creative commons, my personal copyright over anything that I produce.

459
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:10,300
I think the intent of the law is what we really should be looking at because this is going to

460
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:15,980
change number of businesses that are quite popular right now. If I understand correctly and I could

461
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:20,940
be wrong, but I really, I did put some time into it to read this stuff. This is about something

462
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:27,900
called signal theft. And when you think about it, it takes a lot of infrastructure to, and of

463
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:32,300
course, this is why protectionist laws are put in place. It takes a lot of infrastructure to get

464
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:37,900
a television signal to you. And you may not even be seeing that television signal necessarily

465
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:45,420
on a television. It may come through the internet. It could be a digital version of this signal

466
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:52,140
that is streamed or a snippet that ABC or NBC or CNN or some other three letter acronym

467
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:59,820
puts up on the internet. And I believe that this legislation is a shot across the bow of sites like

468
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:11,100
YouTube and Revere and other viral video websites. Because, you know, if you, if I had a

469
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:15,100
dime for every person that says, I don't watch television anymore. I just go to YouTube and

470
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:20,380
type in a search term and it brings up that news report or that skit or that particular thing I

471
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:26,700
wanted to see. Now, that is where the signal theft is taking place. And I do understand the television

472
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:31,980
networks and where they're coming from because it costs a lot of money to, to get this signal out.

473
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:37,500
Even if they're using other people's copyrighted works with their permission, of course,

474
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,540
to create their signal. See it almost as a mashup. You know, I'm using all kinds of,

475
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:49,420
all kinds of elements. In fact, maybe 70% of my show is created by other people. It's pot-sake

476
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:55,660
music or it's comments or whatever. And everyone retains their own copyright. Now, in this case,

477
00:50:55,660 --> 00:51:00,540
I want distribution. I want people to listen to this show. I want them to copy it. It has tremendous

478
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:05,260
benefit to me. It has benefit to the people who contribute to the program, which includes advertisers.

479
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:11,820
But if I were old school and mainstream, then I would probably say, hey, I don't want anyone touching

480
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:15,820
this. I don't want it. It's almost the same as the record companies. We can't put a free and clear

481
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:23,660
MP3 out there. So this is about theft of signal. Because you're basically, and this is coming

482
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:29,020
from the television networks perspective, you're riding on the back of their investment to utilize

483
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:36,060
this content. Even if, excuse me, senseo on radio show. There you go. I did it.

484
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:44,300
And I believe that it is a piece of legislation that essentially will be used to try and shut down

485
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:53,420
sites like YouTube. If I'm wrong, let me know. But I don't think that this is necessarily meant as a

486
00:51:53,420 --> 00:52:00,140
malicious attack against copyright in general. Although it can be misconstrued that way. So I think

487
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:06,300
let them have it. Let them have their signal protection. Because we all agree, it's fun to watch it on

488
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:10,940
YouTube. But if the network doesn't put the video up themselves of the Saturday Night Live

489
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:16,300
skit, it's in violation. We all understand that. It may not be fun, but it's in violation. So that's

490
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:20,540
their right to put that up. And of course, they would also have to clear that with the individual

491
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:25,980
copyright holders, if they have the right to even put that online at all. Because often those

492
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:32,860
rights are not associated with broadcast rights. So maybe, and maybe I do have to call on our

493
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:40,220
musicologist and our Jersey Todd official attorney of the show to give me a little more insight

494
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:45,500
and perspective on this. Just it seems like we're all yelling and shouting about the wrong thing here.

495
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:51,980
And then one other topic, and then I will shut down actually this will end with the song.

496
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:59,500
I just messed up my outline here. I do that. Okay, here we go. It's crap.

497
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:06,460
Here it is. The whole net neutrality debate. Now, I think we were talking about this about this

498
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:11,820
on a daily source code way before Boeing Boeing started talking about it. And this is, and actually

499
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:17,820
it hit when the chairman of SBC said, hey, you know, we feel that we're putting all in all this

500
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:23,100
infrastructure and all these pipes and we're basically building a huge network for other people

501
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:28,300
to make money with and with other people, I believe, is referring to Google and Yahoo. And in a way,

502
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:35,500
it could also be Pod Show. And that those providers of content would have to pay an additional

503
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:45,580
fee for the high speed delivery to the home, which commercially, I guess, if you think about it,

504
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:51,180
it's their right. Now, the overall conversation, of course, is about something called net neutrality,

505
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:58,220
meaning that anyone should be able to access anything on the internet, if it's made of freely

506
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:03,260
available, there should no be certain, there shouldn't be any surcharges on either the consumer side

507
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:07,740
or on the provider side, because essentially they're already paying for the bandwidth. Again,

508
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:16,860
I think we may not have all the information. I think that there are some rights, if SBC is putting

509
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:24,220
in huge infrastructure for better, faster network, they can certainly try in charge, whatever they

510
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:28,380
want for, they're not a monopoly, they're big, I'll give you that, but they're not a monopoly,

511
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:34,140
there are other networks. So, I think competition is, and I don't see anything anti-competitive

512
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:38,300
about this, I think that's the way to solve these issues. If AT&T is charging too much,

513
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:42,140
like if Comcast charge it too much for my internet access, I get another provider,

514
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:47,500
I would actually consider Earthling. If I don't know if I can get that here, probably can't,

515
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,540
I should actually, I should actually, I should get Earthling, I should be smoking our own dope,

516
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:58,540
shouldn't I? So, there's a lot of pile jumping going on, and again, I'm not totally convinced

517
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:02,540
that this is going to be horrible and bad for the internet. I don't jump all over my shit,

518
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:07,020
because again, I think that competition plays a huge role here, and we're not necessarily

519
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:13,900
abided by whatever SBC says. We just aren't. There are other networks that the traffic can

520
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:17,980
travel over. If those networks aren't fast enough or good enough, you have two choices.

521
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:23,500
You know, get more people to work with the alternative networks and build them up and help

522
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:27,900
them get the billions they need to fill out the infrastructure or someone has to pay,

523
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:35,100
look, someone has to pay somewhere sometime. Ben with is just not for free. Ask any podcaster

524
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:39,660
who's, you know, who all of a sudden gets a hate of success, and they're on their, you know,

525
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:44,060
web hosting account, and all of a sudden, if a couple thousand people show up, you run out of

526
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:49,100
bandwidth, and you know, it's not free. The stuff is just not free. We want to think it's free,

527
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:56,700
because blogging is so virtually free, but that uses up so little bandwidth. In fact, we already

528
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:03,660
have this whole net neutrality situation with the cell phone carriers. I mean, we can do incredibly

529
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:10,940
cool stuff with networks. We can send all kinds of great things down the pipeline, but you have

530
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:16,380
no access. You have no direct access to the cell phone networks, because you got to go through

531
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:21,900
the cell phone operators, and they will charge your nuts off to get anything onto their network.

532
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:28,060
This is why, yeah, sure. We can do some things, and, you know, if, if you want, you can certainly

533
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:35,740
download a podcast through your 3G mobile, but then look at your bandwidth bill at the end of the day,

534
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:40,460
or at the end of the month. It's going to be humongous because, yeah, you really only get a gig in

535
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:45,660
and they have all these fit-quote fair use policies of how much you can down. There is no free

536
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:50,700
lunch in this world. So, you know, something immediate, yeah, maybe SBC will do this in the future,

537
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:55,900
but something really immediate when it comes to net neutrality is the darn cell phone operators.

538
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:01,340
The network operators are, they're, I'm not going to say they're evil, but they are definitely

539
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:05,820
not playing a fair game for anyone to just do something, because they're protecting their network,

540
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:11,260
because they'd like to charge for, well, look, here, here's a perfect example. What do you pay for

541
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:18,780
a text message? How much do you pay? 5 cents, 10 cents? 1 cents? I don't care. You can't, you can't,

542
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:27,500
almost can't measure what that costs. It's so low. It's 0.0000001 dollar to actually send that

543
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:33,580
text message over the network. But what's happening? Net neutrality kicks in, which there isn't any,

544
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:41,020
and you pay 10 cents to send a text message. So, this is not something new. You know, this is,

545
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:47,340
and by the way, the cell phone company spent billions, billions on their networks. They have to

546
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:56,460
make it back somehow. So, if I have to pay a little bit extra, I'm used to it. Do I want to know?

547
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:01,900
Do I like the fact that someone has actually made a song about this whole thing? Well, yeah,

548
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:12,300
course I do. Hey, Mr. Telecom, man. God say the internet. Don't change my reality.

549
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:25,340
Keep that neutrality. God say the internet. All I want to be is to read your tunes,

550
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:31,580
where I get my music, and I get my news, where I hook up with the creep, or I find my shoes,

551
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:39,020
don't bring me down. It's a no time to tell about a mother and a man, where some of them

552
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:47,740
folks in our congress want to send us back to the days of the party at the press. And slow us,

553
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:59,980
believe us. Hey, Mr. Telecom, man. God say the internet. Don't change my reality.

554
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:12,220
Keep that neutrality. God say the internet. All I want to be is to read your tunes,

555
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:18,300
where some Republican brothers, people joining this band, folks pissed off, all over this land,

556
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:27,500
all over this land. Don't cry for the wealthy channel, man, with their hands in the pocket of the government.

557
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:33,820
The free market kicks pass, as long as free market means, you've all your money to them.

558
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:46,620
You want your money to them. Hey, Mr. Telecom, man. God say the internet. Don't change my reality.

559
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:55,340
Keep that neutrality. God say the internet.

560
00:59:55,340 --> 01:00:05,340
Keep that neutrality. Keep that neutrality. Keep that neutrality. Keep that neutrality.

561
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:11,340
Keep that neutrality. Keep that neutrality. Keep that neutrality. Keep that neutrality.

562
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:17,340
Keep that neutrality. Keep that neutrality. Keep that neutrality. Keep that neutrality.

563
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:35,340
Keep that neutrality. Keep that neutrality. Keep that neutrality. Keep that neutrality. Keep that neutrality.

564
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:41,340
Keep that neutrality. Keep that neutrality. Keep that neutrality. Keep that neutrality. Keep that neutrality.

565
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:49,340
Keep that neutrality. Keep that neutrality. Keep that neutrality. Keep that neutrality.

566
01:00:49,340 --> 01:01:03,740
But say the internet. Don't change my reality. Keeping that neutrality. God say the internet.

567
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:17,040
Hey, Mr. Telecom, man. God say the internet. Keep that neutrality.

568
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:23,280
Here we go, Javier, you are so hot today

569
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

570
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,280
Don't say it, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

571
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,640
Don't change my reality

572
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,200
I'm gonna go out there, you're so dirty

573
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,800
You're my dog, I'll say it

574
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

575
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,160
I'm gonna go out there

576
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:42,800
Okay

577
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,000
I'll say it, yeah

578
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,200
I'll say it, yeah

579
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,440
I love it when people are creative

580
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,920
But this is, it's a bit over the top Britney Spears

581
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,880
What does he have to do with it?

582
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,640
It's almost like an American folk song

583
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,920
The good old US god save the internet

584
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,240
Internet ain't going anywhere, come on

585
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,520
I'm gonna also alarmist if you're against this stuff

586
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,160
Find a representative you can vote for

587
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,520
And call the other guy and tell him why you're gonna vote for some other person

588
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:15,040
That's what works you, we all have voter fatigue in this country

589
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:19,360
I like the fact that you're making songs and we have all kinds of groovy protests

590
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,680
But, you know, get into the political system

591
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,680
That's how you want to do it

592
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,640
Ten cents per text message, okay?

593
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,160
That's a bigger problem right now

594
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,920
You know, we're being, look at your cell phone bill at the end of the month

595
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,120
It's ten times your internet bill, ten times

596
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,680
And, you know, why?

597
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,000
Well, because these guys got to recoup their investment

598
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,280
And if you feel that they've recoup their investment far enough

599
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:53,840
You know, and that they're just ripping you off go to another provider vote with your wallet vote with your vote

600
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:58,000
Oh, hey, that's it for today. I'm off to the office

601
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,640
I think we got another game starting in just minutes

602
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:05,120
