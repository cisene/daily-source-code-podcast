Delta Sierra Charlie 377.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Dreaming of the past is all that I have.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
To chase away those mundane morning blues.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Feeling like a fool.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Paying by the rules.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Knowing that I can never win.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The fun day born in blues have got me down.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Out of the road from town to town.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Just my day born in blues are all around.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We're real like a the only spot of me down.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I think that my day don't let some day become my day.

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And these blues retain.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We've got a penny in my pocket.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We've got a penny in my pocket.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
When I pay you and you to help me turn to help me.

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I've never had these with my day morning blues.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Those mundane morning blues will let you down.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Better run in the night before you can be the man.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Those mundane morning blues are all around.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Johnny Proctor Monday morning blues.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The way I feel today.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
How you doing everybody?

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's of course in the pod save music network.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Just picked it up by searching for blues.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Not that I'm really bluesy, but it's a bank holiday here in the UK.

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Of course the show coming to you from Curry Cottage in the affluent suburb of.

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Sorry, known as Guildford.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It says bank holiday.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We went through that Friday is I think only the banks are closed.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
They're just counting their money probably their profits.

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So I got up this morning.

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Actually, we went out to dinner last night with the neighbors with Jimmy and Marion.

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
They're retired, but they're very active in local social life.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So it's a good way to find out what's going on in the neighborhood and who's doing what to whom and why and how deep.

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And so this morning, I was really really tired because last week was just felt like the longest week in history.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And I didn't.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Patricia, let me sleep because Christine, of course, had it there from school.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Normally I would take it to school in the whole routine.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
We'd start around 7, 7, 30 a.m.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And so I'm looking at my watch and I can laugh.

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm like, oh, yeah, it's nice time to get up.

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And then I'm literally just doping around and all of a sudden I realize, wait a minute, it's Monday.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I got stuff to do here.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There's no bank holiday in the US.

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I gotta be prepared and by the way, it's a Monday.

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
There's no vacation, no rest for the wicked.

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Not for the daily source code.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm really trying to stick to our daily schedule.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Really trying to keep it to 40 minutes.

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Really trying to just have some fun with y'all.

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Lots of second life stuff going on over the week.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I want to talk about that in our second life talk.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You see now it's SLT in the show notes, actually.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So it's weird.

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You know that we're in this time warp.

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, yeah.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's really, really hard to get into the whole Monday vibe.

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Hence the Monday morning blues.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Where's that guy from Johnny Proctor?

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
South Carolina.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And he's had some success.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Four pages of songs upon the PMN.

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Excellent.

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay.

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Right off the bat portions of the show sponsored by GoDaddy.

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You heard that the beginning of the show.

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
If you want a registered domain name for the Ultra Super low cheap price of 695,

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
upon checkout use the code DSC3.

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And you'll get that domain for 695.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Been reading a lot in the weekend over the paper.

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Actually, over the weekend, the Sunday papers were full of this huge scandal here in Britain.

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
A minister of parliament.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He's been having not won, but well, at first we thought he'd just been having one affair.

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He's been married to his wife for a think.

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Was it 20 or 25 years?

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And he basically had an affair.

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
A two year affair with his.

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I think I don't know if it's always his schedule.

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Secretary.

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So the girl who keeps his schedule.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Gee, how convene is that?

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let me just pencil myself.

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And an apparent and alleged second mistress.

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Solder's story to the mail.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And it was this is just huge.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's so big.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And so it's kind of interesting to follow the media coverage.

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This is very typical stuff here in the UK and the papers are also fighting against each other.

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And who has the best story and the juiciest story.

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm sure that lots of it is not true.

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But it's a dude.

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That guy had a shitty weekend.

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I can tell you that.

103
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Also, what's still high on the agenda here is the BBC.

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm sure they're bummed out about all this noise about the minister of parliament.

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Because they're trying to now really push the pedal to the metal.

106
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
They get their money from public funds.

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Well, I mean, from public funds, the public literally pays for a television and radio license.

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's a hundred and twenty-one pounds a year.

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So, you know, ten pounds a month and you can watch and enjoy all the BBC programs.

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
If you don't, by the way, even if you buy a television set, they'll track you down.

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And the fine can be up to a thousand pounds.

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So, but it's good.

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I enjoy what the BBC delivers.

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And now they want to raise the amount of money they want.

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Above standard inflation rates.

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So they're asking for, I think, 2.3 percent more.

117
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm not too sure on the figures, but it's a hell of a lot of hundred millions more.

118
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Which means that we, the inhabitants would have to pay more.

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And so now they're going through this whole review process.

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And they're trying to prove that it's going to be worth it.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And one of the things that's very interesting they said,

122
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
it's that they are dealing with extraordinary inflation.

123
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Which boils down to the fact, they say that because of the media landscape today,

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
it's very hard to get good qualified people.

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So they need more money to attract these, these high flyers who are already been snapped up by

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
other broadcast corporations and other production companies.

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And I was like, please, would you open up your ears for a second and listen to the

128
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
talent that's all around you?

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
No, no.

130
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
They've put that in a separate little box.

131
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And they're saying, we're going to make the BBC.com website.

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Or BBC.co.uk website.

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We're going to make it the place for user generous.

134
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Content content content content content content.

135
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So they're trying to be hipsters.

136
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And they're also saying it's going to be, this is interesting that they want to be the place for independent music.

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay.

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's, we'll see what they do with that.

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I still find that there's a huge disconnect within the BBC between BBC digital,

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
who are responsible for all that stuff.

141
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And the program makers, the people who are making radio and television programming,

142
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
they really don't cooperate together from my personal observations.

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So they're trying to show that they're worth all this extra money.

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And I think they're going to be, it's going to be declined, I think.

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And justly so.

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And so now they're also publishing the salaries of the top TV host and then radio presenters.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And it's just, the newspapers are really going at this.

148
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You have Rupert Murdoch who owns Sky, who has really a competition for the BBC in the marketplace,

149
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and though it's competition for eyeballs, not for advertising money,

150
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
because the BBC doesn't have any advertisers.

151
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And so the sun newspaper, which he owns, of course, is slamming the BBC off the time.

152
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So it's just fun to watch.

153
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Got a piece of feedback, which I was very excited about.

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Patricia's out shopping, otherwise I'd bring her in to tell her this.

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Dennis Belonget, I think, is the way to pronounce it.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Been listening to the Charlie almost since the beginning, like in a lot, all of it.

157
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
On DSC 375, you in Patricia, always nice to hear from her.

158
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
We're talking about the Sinatra show that Oblua's son is doing with his father's song.

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
See ya.

160
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Then commented that the Beatles should do that, too.

161
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Well, of course, the Beatles can't really, but whoever owns the rights to it can.

162
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Well, good news, they're preparing a big show in Vegas in collaboration with Cirque de Soleil

163
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and Faun Suap, Perus, a radio comic from the province of Quebec, who worked in France for a while.

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So your wish, in a sense, will come true in a year, too.

165
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That's great.

166
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And I don't know how you found out about Dennis or Dennis Benolje from Canada, but yeah, I do.

167
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We'd like buy a ticket immediately to go see that.

168
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That would be so awesome.

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Hello.

170
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Are you okay with being okay?

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Then check out the Media Ocar shows official debut on Maxim Radio, Serious 108.

172
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Live and unedited with listener calls and a very special guest from burningangel.com.

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The Media Ocar Show version 2.0.

174
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It only hurts from, for more info, go to www.mediolcarshow.com.

175
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It all starts Wednesday, May 3rd at 10 p.m. Eastern on Maxim Radio, Serious 108.

176
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You got that's pretty interesting.

177
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That's the first promo I've received for another show on Serious on the soundlight ever.

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And I'm not sure if it's a podcast that has now become a show on Maxim or how that works.

179
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But I just want to fit it right inside the soundlight.

180
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We know to make sure y'all heard it.

181
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Do you believe anything is possible?

182
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We do.

183
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Where are flink?

184
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We believe in an internet that's safe from viruses and scammers.

185
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Where are flink?

186
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
We believe your personal information should be just that, personal.

187
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And we believe your internet should be a friend, not a foe.

188
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Where are flink?

189
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Make this smart choice, visit earthlink.net and discover what our internet experts can do for you.

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Earthlink.

191
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
We revolve around you.

192
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So Troy Rodder sends me this email.

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And ever since I played that geek song,

194
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
the geeky song about the MPAA and the RIA,

195
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm getting all kinds of interesting other geek tunes sent to me.

196
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm really like them.

197
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And this one actually I think is I'm going to dedicate to my partner Ron Bloom.

198
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Because we talk about this so much.

199
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We're in the final throes of designing,

200
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
we're really getting the design ready for a full launch of podshow plus and the PDN.

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And we're still kind of old school guys, right?

202
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
From 12 years ago we were doing HTML and tables.

203
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And of course now it's all CSS.

204
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And we talk about this a lot and it seems to be some,

205
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
what I call it,

206
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
some constraints based upon some CSS choices that have been made.

207
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And we're just, you know, look, I'm a DJ and Ron's a guitar player.

208
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You know, we're just trying to figure out what this stuff is.

209
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And so I came across this song which Troy Rodder pointed me to.

210
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And I'll put a link to everything that he put in there into the show notes.

211
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I don't, it's not pod save, but I'll take the heat because it's a parody.

212
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And I think it's pretty funny.

213
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It is the love song to CSS.

214
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Which of course are cascading style sheets?

215
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That much I know.

216
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's a nice, chill tune for a Monday.

217
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Doing whatever you do when you win the Charlie.

218
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You know, we're just trying to figure out what this stuff is.

And we're just trying to figure out what this stuff's is.

288
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Don't tell us that you'll be well said

289
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Tonight I need you to see your steps

290
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Going into the darkness

291
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You'll be well said

292
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:49,000
So I believe that was from Andrew Rothman who sent to the BOAG World.com podcast and then that got sent on to me tonight

293
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I need your CSS baby. Oh yeah

294
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
We've officially crossed a boundary here on the daily source code

295
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
We're stuff that you're sending in just may not make it onto the air

296
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I have too much stuff

297
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
TMS just too much stuff coming in

298
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So if you don't hear it right away that means I may play it later

299
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Because I do keep it all and I'm coming up with some interesting ways to file stuff away and categorize stuff

300
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Oh, I really really do wish you would do better with your ID3 tags. It would help me so much

301
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
If you don't know what that is just go to iTunes open up

302
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Put anything you're sending to me into iTunes

303
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Then do a get info and then fill out the information

304
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Give me a good meaningful title. It's just like email

305
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Put in the comments when the lyrics feel or anywhere

306
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'll be able to see it put in what it's about

307
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So it kind of helps me with the organization

308
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yeah, I wish we could standardize that just like CSS

309
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That would be so nice. So and some of it just won't ever make it onto the air. I'm sorry

310
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But I also don't have time to reply to everything and everybody so I hope you understand

311
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
These phone numbers are really working though. I must have received 25 different voice mail

312
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Over the weekend and I have to say 80% 70

313
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Now let's say 70% from listeners who've never had an opportunity to send in a comment before because they just either don't know how

314
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Or can't be bothered to

315
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,640
Record something and then send it off to me. So they're really digging it the phone lines if you're in the car right now

316
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:31,000
We have a US number in Jersey 201 625 6357 or in the UK 020 766 8137 5353

317
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Let me see if they're working hold on

318
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Great evening. This is just a test to see whether the connectivity works under this number from distant Abu Dhabi

319
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I guess it does

320
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
There'll be a comment following in the next couple of days. Okay, bye. This concludes our test from Abu Dhabi

321
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Hey Adam maybe this is one for the dev cache, but is

322
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Potual plus an online interface or is it a download program because

323
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,000
To replace iTunes for me it has to be a download program. I'm not gonna crank open the web browser

324
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Every time I want to do something

325
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Oh, that's a very good question

326
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So I think if I and I listen to your question a couple of times

327
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I think the answer is no and yes at the same time

328
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Potual plus will be a place where you manage your subscriptions. In fact, you can manage your iTunes if you want

329
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So you know when when you want stuff to come into your iTunes and how you want it and how you want it categorized

330
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And in what playlist you want it you'll be able to manage that from Potual plus

331
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So that's one part so you won't have to download anything anything additional

332
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
If you want to put it on to a different MP3 player

333
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
We'll have a special little thing there that you just if you're running windows

334
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And there'll also be a Mac version you just download that and don't think about it

335
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And it'll put the files wherever you want them

336
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But what I think is most exciting

337
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And I'm not really a big iPod listener. I have to be honest

338
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I have I use the dashboard a bit of an alpha version of the dashboard

339
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Which is giving me the exact same in fact a better experience than iTunes

340
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Because I can shoot through all of my subscriptions see what's new see what's updated

341
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Q things up to play next while something's already playing

342
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I can interspersed that with songs and the pod save music network

343
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
All kind yeah and of course that that's not a download all of that is coming in streaming in real time

344
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And we're really doing this because I believe

345
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You know there were a lot of guys when you know the was the famous quote by by Bill Gates who said

346
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
If you need I really don't remember this it was it

347
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
There's no reason to believe you need more than 64k to write a whole program

348
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It wasn't even 64k it was like 640 bytes or something

349
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Some ridiculously low number that you wouldn't need more than that to create any program you could imagine

350
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And so you know folks were programming for the I think the smart developers

351
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
We're programming for much more than that knowing that

352
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The capacity of the personal computer would grow over time

353
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And you know we've essentially also been working against the bandwidth barriers

354
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You know saying okay well we can do this when the bandwidth is more and we have more bandwidth

355
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And we will eventually have even more bandwidth

356
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And I'm a true or firm believer that within the not too distant future

357
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm gonna say five years because I've learned so within five years

358
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
We won't know any different than that every single device is connected to the network and one shape or form

359
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And that'll be anywhere you go including your iPod

360
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It may be interface through your car or whatever

361
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But however you're going to listen to it I'm pretty confident it's going to be

362
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Got through a connected stream

363
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That's not really I'm not really thinking about streaming if you think about an online radio station

364
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But just getting like like Gmail for instance

365
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I don't use outlook I don't use Apple's mail client

366
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I just use a web browser and all my stuff is stored somewhere else

367
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's professionally managed it works almost all the time

368
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yes, I could use a hell of a lot more space and willing to pay for it Google

369
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
But it's no longer a matter of having all that stuff on your machine itself

370
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So I think that your podcast subscriptions will kind of go the same way

371
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And eventually you won't want anything to download because everything will be connected

372
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Keep waiting, keep open, get my ticket and do some development on it

373
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And very well version of DHB

374
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So just wondering what it's going to be if it's online or

375
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Is it actual program that you download but

376
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
All right, keep it to good work

377
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Okay, so again, I hope I answered your question

378
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It'll work with your iTunes so you don't have to to leave iTunes if you don't want to

379
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
But I think we're going to make a pretty convincing argument that you're going to be using the

380
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Mashedboard more than iTunes

381
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And a new dev cast went up a Friday with Aaron O'Neill our database sorceress

382
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So if you want to check that out that I don't think we've given out all the golden tickets

383
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I think we set it up for 20 for this for this time around

384
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And at least eight of them I saw we're handed out so you still have a shot if you want to get in

385
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Early on pocho plus and on the pdn

386
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Adam, this is George from Kino man

387
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm doing time up here in Kino and we love to listen to the Jatsa

388
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Especially when we're having sex with each other after lights out man

389
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You know I even downloaded a picture of you on the internet that I came to my cellmates back

390
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
When I reached him up and writing like a wetted new old man

391
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So hey keep on the good work and hey if you're ever up in Kino

392
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Swing by for a conjugal visit and if you didn't do much trouble

393
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Maybe if you can smuggle a file in your ass

394
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Hey, that would be a big help do man

395
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's okay Mark

396
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It's that time again for

397
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Time to slap the window down

398
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The sad light repair man coming after you

399
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Sad light repair man what's he gonna do

400
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
He'll fit your misconceptions and answer questions to

401
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
There's nothing in the universe that you can't do for you

402
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Sad light repair man

403
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Sad light repair man

404
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Here comes

405
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So as far as I can tell it's a regular line up for this evening with Pacific Coast

I don't know if he's going to do the U-turn cafe tonight or not

409
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
That's all going up until 10 p.m. Eastern time on serious stars 102

Download the rest of the show because there is some pretty cool stuff that we're going to talk about

413
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
That you're not going to hear because the windows closing right now

414
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Bye-bye

415
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Let's get back to our phone calls for sec

416
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Hey Adam Sharon and Tampa or Tampa on as Mad likes to call it

417
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Thanks so much for putting the phone lines up

418
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I've just wanted to tell you thanks so much for podcasting

419
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And because of you I'm like listening to so much

420
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I said it went to my eyes and that is out of the

421
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And you know this story and met some good friends and just love the whole experience

422
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And I love when lady Patricia comes on the show

423
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Because I love when she puts you in your place

424
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Yeah

425
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
She's so sweet

426
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Thanks Adam

427
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Bye

428
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Yes she is

429
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Sharon she is so sweet

430
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
That's why I've been married to her for 20 years and still feels like the first time

431
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Which I could play that song

432
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Over the weekend I did show Patricia a second life

433
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And I was a little wary to be quite honest because you know she's so smart

434
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
She's like online game

435
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yeah, okay what's it about fucking

436
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I said well there's that

437
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And she said well just don't let anyone see you

438
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Okay

439
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
This is why I love my wife she's so incredibly smart and with it

440
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But she was actually fascinated and she's been asking a lot of questions and she has some pretty good insights

441
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And we've been talking about business opportunities for second life and

442
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You know people keep asking when will we see lady Patricia in the castle I said well

443
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
That could be one hell freezes over

444
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Yeah, my name is Cody Brownley I'm a podcast or from Oklahoma

445
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And I just want to tell you that I need to be bringing you all a whole bunch of these

446
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But I think what you're doing is a great thing

447
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Podcasting as a second my life in so many ways it's

448
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Actually the story I want to tell you was

449
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I'm a junior high school and I at the beginning of year

450
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I was slated to get into a glass and actually

451
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It was a scheduling error and I put them in the glass and correctly as a broadcast

452
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And class sounds like what the heck I really want to be in the class

453
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And it's also about the time I started a podcast thing and that I had just started having us

454
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's like so good so successful show and we just and that we got the top 25 of iTunes

455
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It was just really a really big deal for me

456
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I was like yeah, and I ended up using that to my advantage

457
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I showed a point out that I was doing better than shows that were done by CNN shows

458
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Or they're done by ABC news

459
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And I was just showing them that like I didn't have the skills to be in the class

460
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And actually my podcast and skills paid off and I was allowed into the class

461
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So you know, if you were the great workout and my love here in the Charlie every night

462
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I listened to it before I got a bed

463
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So that's also that's the lesson to the next day while I'm driving a school

464
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
But I want to say that you're doing a great job, you have the great work

465
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And you know, just keep doing a great job

466
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I want to send some encouragement to you

467
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
That's fantastic

468
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I really like that

469
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
That's how you're going to hone your chops, man

470
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
That really is

471
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
That's the way to do it if you're interested

472
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And you're more than welcome to climb a board

473
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
You know, it's unfortunate a couple of the voice comments that came in

474
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
People making phone calls and cell phones

475
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And it already sounds kind of crudty

476
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Just because of the the resolution of phone lines

477
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
You know, which is what five killer hurts or something like that

478
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It's very, very low resolution

479
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So the sound will never sound as good as a recorded comment

480
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
But some of them just cutting in and out and sounding shitty

481
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And it's too bad because there were some really good ones about

482
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
One guy sent in a comment about his first car

483
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I'd love to hear if you could call in and give me that again

484
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I'd love to hear the whole story

485
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Because it was always I tried to enhance it

486
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I couldn't get the sound right at all

487
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Garbage and Garbage out stuff

488
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
So if you have a cool story about your first car

489
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Let's hear it because I think that's something that I'll be fun to talk about

490
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And he actually had a great story so send it in if you want

491
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
But again, the quality sometimes just prohibits use of the voice mail

492
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
It's unfortunate

493
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Garbage and Garbage and Garbage and Garbage and Garbage

494
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
We have a situation

495
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
If you're inside of eating your second life property

496
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Help

497
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Help

498
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
No, just kidding

499
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It's your neutral neighbor

500
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Comic-Straper blogger known in second life as comic-senior

501
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
So it was nice meeting you in second life Adam Carey

502
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Thank you for teaching me how to operate bazooka in second life

503
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
To shoot down a star ship

504
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Anyway, I have a question

505
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I have a question to everybody interested in visual realities

506
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
How to be sure how to be certain if anonymity must be granted

507
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And that the other person in visual reality is female

508
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And not male who is just pretending to be female

509
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Maybe your listeners could help out

510
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So so see you in second life neighbor

511
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Okay neighbor, that's right next to the castle in second life

512
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And if you're just joining, please check this stuff out

513
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Because it really will mess with your head

514
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And I'll be the first guy to show it to point out some really good drugs that won't kill you

515
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Okay, that's what second life is

516
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Secondlife.com

517
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And so comic-straper blogger purchased a parcel of land right next to the castle

518
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
The Curry Castle

519
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And he put this huge lighthouse on top of it

520
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And it was like, okay, when I first moved there I bought the land

521
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
There was almost no one around

522
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Now there's a couple other castles

523
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It's getting pretty crowded

524
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I have to make some decisions here

525
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
But you know, I'm trying to be good neighbor

526
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
So I flew up to the top of comic strip bloggers lighthouse

527
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And he was unpacking

528
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It wasn't a bazooka, it was an atomic RPG

529
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
And it's kind of like the unique

530
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Of course, second life is all based on hackers and programmers

531
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So it's very common to help out new people

532
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And show them the way around

533
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Because there's always someone who showed me and showed everyone

534
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
The ropes in the beginning

535
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And so I showed them how to unpack it and how to shoot it

536
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I think actually CSB since you own that spaceship

537
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
There's a preference you can set

538
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Which is make, was it make damage permanent?

539
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Something like that

540
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I think that's the way you can blow stuff off

541
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Because in the damage actually we'll take place

542
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And you'll have to rebuild you can't just restore

543
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Something like that, I'm pretty sure

544
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So I was hanging out in second life

545
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Quite a bit over the weekend

546
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And it was once again a mind-bending experience

547
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Oh, let me answer that second question, comic strip blogger

548
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It's very, very easy

549
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Now the way second life is currently run

550
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Or large portion of it

551
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Is girls who are online

552
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Typically they become an escort

553
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
They make themselves really pretty

554
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
They get hit on all the time by guys

555
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
And then they sooner or later the pimps come out

556
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And they say, hey, you know what?

557
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
You can get hit on by guys

558
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
You can live all the time

559
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But if you come over here and dance in my club

560
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And if you want you can become an escort

561
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
You can make money

562
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And then you can go shopping

563
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And there's a lot of shopping in second life

564
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It's very hard to find male clothing for your avatar

565
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
But there's lots of stuff for women

566
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I've just tons and tons of stuff

567
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
You can't, in fact

568
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I think this will be hugely successful with women

569
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Although probably your right comic strip

570
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Probably a lot of the cute women who are in there are guys

571
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Or young boys

572
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Trying to make some linden dollars to go and build stuff

573
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
That can shoot other people out of the sky

574
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So there's only one real way to know

575
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And I've done this myself

576
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You go shopping with her

577
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Go shopping with her first

578
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And that's how you know if it's really a woman or not

579
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
You can just tell

580
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And so I went shopping with a couple women over the weekend

581
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Actually Angie B

582
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
She went with myself

583
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
And oh I have a business partner

584
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
In second life

585
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
This is really cool

586
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I don't want to say her name because I don't know if she wants me to mention that

587
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Or how silent or upfront she wants to be about the partnership

588
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
She's an ex escort

589
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
She's stunningly beautiful

590
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And she really wants to have a purpose in second life

591
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And I've had some ideas for a while

592
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And she's been on for a couple years

593
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So she knows exactly where to go to get stuff

594
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
She knows all the great designers

595
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
All the great engineers, programmers, developers

596
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
We're thinking about setting up our own sim

597
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Which means we even run our own server

598
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm confident we can make money out of this

599
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And you know me

600
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm always the guy I was looking for a way to commercialize

601
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Because that's my life

602
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I like doing things that I have fun doing

603
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And make money out of them

604
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
That's kind of what I've always done

605
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And I went shopping with her and with Angie B

606
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And they bought me some new hair

607
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And I could tell you know

608
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I know Angie B is Angie B

609
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So I know that she's a girl

610
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And she shops like a girl

611
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It's obvious

612
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So that's the way you tell

613
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
She has B

614
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You don't need to know anything else

615
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Just go shopping

616
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
See how they react

617
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Usually that'll be a dead give away

618
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Within the first three minutes

619
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Hey Adam

620
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Remember way back on DSC 296

621
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I signed off saying

622
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Which I was in San Francisco

623
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Parting with you pod show guys

624
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And you were like party

625
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Well I'd have to say that logging in the second life

626
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Hanging out at your virtual castle

627
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And smoking a virtual joint

628
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
It's just about what I had in mind

629
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Where I thought about parting with you

630
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Dork

631
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Just kidding

632
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
You know I love you

633
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
See you in second life

634
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Oh that's hot

635
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
See you in second life baby

636
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It's true

637
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So I'm hanging out at the castle

638
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Was that yesterday

639
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And there must have been eight

640
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Eight or nine people who dropped by

641
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Many of them listeners

642
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Couple of I know in real life

643
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Angie wasn't there

644
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I guess she was offline most of the day

645
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
But castle

646
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And Joe

647
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Who I know from the UK

648
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
They dropped in

649
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And so we're just kind of hanging out

650
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
And then

651
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It's very hard to explain

652
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
But when you're all sitting there

653
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And then I can actually start a song

654
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I haven't figured out how to get pod save

655
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Music in there yet

656
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So it's kind of it's some 80 stuff

657
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Actually in fact we had an 80's

658
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Revival dance off

659
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And it sounds dorky

660
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I know but I can't help it

661
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And so I'm spinning tombs

662
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And then I got the disco lights going

663
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
And then we said

664
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Okay let's do a photo shoot

665
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Let's take some

666
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Because you can take a screen

667
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Shot basically

668
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And you can position the angle

669
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Any way you want

670
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And so I gave everyone a pod show

671
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
T-shirt

672
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
So okay everyone put the pod show

673
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
T-shirt on

674
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And then we'll pose in front of the fireplace

675
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And it was just like a real photo shoot

676
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You know someone can't get the T-shirt on

677
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Right and then you have to tell it

678
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
When to shut up

679
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And let's coordinate and let's sit here

680
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And then someone else jumps up and moves around

681
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And so finally we got it done

682
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And it was real

683
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I was there

684
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It's frightening

685
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It really is

686
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Now I still believe that

687
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You're going to

688
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
What do I believe

689
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
You know the aspects of this

690
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Yeah it sucks you in

691
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
But I think we can really be productive

692
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
There's a lot of things

693
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
In fact I wouldn't mind sitting in my office

694
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
And having representations of

695
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Other pod show people at HQ sitting in my office

696
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Sitting in the office or in the same proximity

697
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And we can pass stuff to each other

698
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Which would be notes

699
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
The way we do in real life

700
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Only I think that this is a much richer interface

701
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And you really do get sucked in

702
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Whereas if I'm on Skype or on I am

703
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Or emailing with people

704
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Then it's still seem somewhat removed

705
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And the reverse is also kind of true

706
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
That and I've said this before

707
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Second life is doing something to me in real life

708
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
In fact

709
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I actually went out shopping with Patricia on Sunday

710
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And had a good time

711
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And then she's walking along

712
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I'm looking at her saying

713
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
To myself

714
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
She would really look good in

715
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
In a dress like this

716
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It's because I've been looking at all these avatars

717
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And having these exact same thoughts

718
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And it's really giving me some kind of

719
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Appreciation for

720
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
For real life

721
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It's hard to explain

722
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It really really is

723
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But emotion

724
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And communication

725
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Melded into one with the visual aspect

726
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It does something to you again

727
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I am the guy

728
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Who gladly point you towards the drugs

729
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
That won't kill you

730
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Hey Adam

731
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It's PD love from Love House radio

732
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Also does Dinkin in second life

733
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Hey I was wondering

734
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And this is regarding second life

735
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I think I could borrow your attack helicopter

736
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I've got a date next week

737
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And that's fine

738
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
What would it be better to impresser

739
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Than your attack helicopter

740
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
So if you don't mind

741
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
If you're not using it say Tuesday night

742
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
If I could just take it from a ride

743
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I do a little practice STEM

744
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Anyway

745
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Glad to see you in second life

746
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Enjoy the tripping brownie

747
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Then ride it off

748
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And I'll talk to you soon

749
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Bye bye

750
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Yeah, does no poor

751
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
PD love

752
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
This is a thing this hard is

753
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Because you can't use the same names

754
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
In real life

755
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Or

756
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Whatever you have to kind of choose

757
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
A last name that's given to you

758
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It's almost impossible to

759
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Remember who's who's who

760
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I'll just say does

761
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
That was fun dude

762
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I had the the trippy brownie

763
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So I've got these blunts

764
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I've got some joints

765
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And they all do things

766
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
So you have a jar

767
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
They make you fall down

768
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And fall over and do funny stuff

769
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Nothing dangerous

770
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Luckily

771
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
But then there's this trippy brownie

772
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And you can actually ride on it

773
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And then so

774
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
We went outside for a little bit

775
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
After doing this photo shoot

776
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Everybody hopped on the trippy brownie

777
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And we just crashed around

778
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And it was

779
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm literally sitting here laughing out loud

780
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And the comments people are making on the ride

781
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It was very immersive

782
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
A very immersive experience

783
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And then I caged everybody

784
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And just showed off

785
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Some of my fledgling

786
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Second life skills

787
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And it was cool

788
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I don't think you want the attack helicopter to do

789
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Take the Corske S76

790
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And if you want I'll even pilot it for you

791
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So you guys can hang out in the back

792
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I think that'll be much better

793
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Hey Adam

794
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Bob Evans here

795
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Got my real name in second life

796
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I don't know why you couldn't

797
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Compare that you can get your real name

798
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I suspect that Curry just wasn't added to the drop down

799
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
From which you select your last name

800
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I never miss the Charlie

801
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Keep it up

802
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Please invite me to the party to castle

803
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
When I get more time in second life

804
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I will be trying to find it

805
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I'm still a newbie and having a hard time

806
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Finding time to get in there and just search around

807
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Yeah no problem

808
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Just go to your find

809
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Command and search for curry castle

810
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I listed it now in the

811
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
In the search engine

812
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Which cost you 30 bucks a week

813
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I think

814
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Linden box that is of course which is zero point

815
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
3

816
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Was it 30

817
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
30 US cents or something like that

818
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Shoot what I'm going to say something about that

819
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Now anyway

820
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
What I witnessed over the weekend

821
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Really showed me some of the power of people just hanging out

822
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And this really works

823
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
There's no reason why we couldn't have

824
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Pot say music artist drop by

825
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I know this away

826
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I haven't investigated yet

827
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Angie B is actually working on figuring that out

828
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
There's a way for

829
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And

830
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Excuse me

831
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
There's a way for an artist to perform live

832
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And that to be represented in second life

833
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And I think that the experience will be

834
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Would be that much more enhancing

835
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Instead of just listening to someone performing live

836
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
On a stream you actually can see the performance

837
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
See their representation of who they think they are

838
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
What they want to be in second life

839
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And some podcasts

840
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I think will also be appropriate

841
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Not this one

842
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Because I want you to have your own

843
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Mental image of where I am

844
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
What I'm doing and how I'm doing it and what the cottage

845
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
It looks like and

846
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
You know I really like that

847
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It gives me a much more I think a much more intimate vibe

848
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
In the show

849
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
But if you take

850
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Heather and Janelle for instance

851
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
They could actually sit around and have some of their friends

852
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Who come on the show regularly

853
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Actually come into the show

854
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And they could do that in any environment

855
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
They want it to be

856
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And that show of course

857
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
He said slightly

858
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Is underwritten by acu view

859
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And you can find it at download.acuview.com

860
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I could understand

861
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
That was just

862
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
More cowbell

863
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm a little acen copy

868
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000

872
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
So let me

873
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
It's been a while since I gave you the time

874
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And about as long as you were on kind

875
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
All the by the telephone

876
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:22,000
If you were separate you

877
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Say no for a rainy day

878
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And do that all the way

879
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Yeah

880
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I don't know what's in it

881
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
It's not your idea

882
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
But don't wish a new someone

883
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000

Don't think it

886
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
If I'm only tried

887
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000

888
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000

00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000

896
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I'm one of the wives

897
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I could talk myself

898
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And together

899
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000

901
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I've changed my mind

902
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
If I tried just one more time

903
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
But I can say

904
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I'm not alive

905
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000

976
00:43:55,100 --> 00:44:02,200
Don't think that if I only try and know you are real, that you never will be touched

977
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:09,200
All right, I'm so done with you!

978
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:16,200
Oh, Beth sent me a nice note over the weekend thanking me for playing her other song, Mr. Lovely, which is another just fabulous song

979
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,200
Where have you been all my life, Beth?

980
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:26,200
Wow, this is great. She's got three, yeah, like two and a half pages of songs up on pot safe music network of music.potshow.com, link to Beth

981
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,700
Of course in the show notes, excellent stuff. That'll do it for today. Just kicking off your weekend

982
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:39,200
It's gonna be a busy week Wednesday. Let's see, Wednesday evening Patricia and I are going to Joan Collins. She's performing a

983
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:48,200
Small theater tour, you know, Joan Collins, Alexis Carrington from Dynasty, so we she was on on a big talk show here Jonathan Ross

984
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:56,200
Two weeks ago, I think, and you know, let's just go see what she's gonna do like an hour and ten or hour and 15 minutes with about her life

985
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:03,200
And she's been married to some pretty interesting guys, so there's that. I'm going to the dentist this week. That's always pretty big

986
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:11,200
And Patricia and I are also planning on having lunch one of these days on the Isle of White, which means we'll be flying there with a Delta Sierra

987
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:16,200
I'm gonna see if I can get Jason to fly along with us to show us he's probably been there many times

988
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,200
So I just want to get the routing down, you know, so that I can do it by myself in the future

989
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:28,200
So we may record something on the way and back in the airplane. I'll cut out all and you know, most of the pilot chatter

990
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:35,200
And so you because Patricia will be on the intercom with us and she can talk along and so maybe you'll get a, you know, but yeah, that'll be a much better

991
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:42,200
Sound seeing tour because she's very very visually oriented and she'll be looking at the ground while we're looking at the instruments and she can tell us what we're seeing

992
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:51,200
So that and, uh, oh, Krike, I don't know. There's all kinds of stuff going on and of course more golden tickets being handed out for you to come out and check pod show
