1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
For the first time ever, the Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. in one action-packed DVD collection,

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,000
own all 27 episodes, the cult hit, including all new interviews with Carlton Koo.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,560
First thing that Brisco did that impressed us was, we're not only to come in and really read the dialogue well as an actor,

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,720
but he also did a standing flip in our office.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,640
You've flipped too for Brisco County!

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,320
If you like the kind of TV you can't get on TV, get your copy of the Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,320
Available now on DVD!

8
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,320
And the darkness key calm night.

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,320
And God saw everything that he had made and behold, it was good.

10
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:17,320
And God created man, and man created machine, and machine, machine created music.

11
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:24,320
And machine saw everything you had made and said, behold.

12
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:32,320
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

13
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,320
And the next generation radio content in my ears.

14
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,320
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

15
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:58,320
The day is starting to look out into a brand new morning, and everybody smiles.

16
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,320
They do.

17
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,320
The one we do, they take your hand, they tell you that they understand it's true.

18
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:15,320
When you listen, when I tell you, do we know right?

19
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,320
Do we know, okay?

20
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:25,320
When the world comes out to greet you, do we know right?

21
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Do we know, okay?

22
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:40,320
When the world comes out to greet you, do we know right?

23
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,320
Do we know, okay?

24
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:55,320
When the world comes out to greet you, do we know right?

25
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:05,320
Do we know, okay?

26
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:38,320
How we show you place, where you can walk in the sun, I will show you a place, where you can be what you want,

27
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:48,320
I will show you a place where you love, count it free, I will show you a place, so come on, go there with me,

28
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,320
cause you do we know right?

29
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,320
Do we know, okay?

30
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:03,320
When the world comes out to greet you, do we know right?

31
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,320
Do we know, okay?

32
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:13,320
When the world comes out to greet you, do we know right?

33
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,320
Do we know, okay?

34
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:22,320
When the world comes out to greet you, do we know right?

35
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,320
Do we know, okay?

36
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:41,320
When the world comes out to greet you, do we know, okay?

37
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Oh man, wish I had my cowbell here.

38
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:53,320
I'm so ready.

39
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,320
Oops.

40
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:07,320
As you can tell, definitely in the portable set-up load.

41
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,320
Is this better?

42
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Yeah, there we go.

43
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,320
Originally from New Zealand, and now build as from France.

44
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,320
She's from France, everybody.

45
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,320
Okay, that's when he grows, doing all right from the pod save music network.

46
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Boy, this sounds like crap today.

47
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:40,320
As you can hear, definitely still having some health issues in New York City.

48
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
That's where the daily source code is coming to you from.

49
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,320
I realize it kind of sounds like I'm talking out of my ass.

50
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,320
I'm not quite sure what I can do to fix that.

51
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
Let's see if we can change a little bit here.

52
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:57,320
I've got the pod set up, so I need just a little more output home.

53
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
Let me try that.

54
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,320
Okay, that's a little bit better there.

55
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,320
Yeah, sitting here in the Grammarcy Park Hotel had a great early morning.

56
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,320
A great early started, five o'clock, of course.

57
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,320
I woke up, wide awake, saying, what the hell,

58
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,320
Hold on, that's the blackberry.

59
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:22,320
I think I, I think I definitely have an infection.

60
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:28,320
Even when I laugh, you can just hear all this flim is just sitting there ready to crush out all over you.

61
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:35,320
So two days in New York, it's a big advertising agency going not just agencies,

62
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,320
but also advertisers directly speaking on a panel tomorrow here at the OMD conference.

63
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,320
And it's really been fantastic.

64
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,320
We started this morning, early with a meeting with Jennifer and Chef Mark,

65
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:53,320
Chef Mark East Coast, regarding the culinary podcast network.

66
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Very excited about stuff we can do with them.

67
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,320
And boy, there's some entrepreneurs there, let me tell you.

68
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,320
And I just been trying to keep myself kind of low-key, trying to keep my guts together

69
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,320
because even when I laugh, you can hear what happens, right?

70
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,320
It just all starts to come up.

71
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
I really miss Patricia.

72
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,320
She would make me better in half a day.

73
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,320
I know she would.

74
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,320
I just, I, anyway.

75
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,320
It's the beginning of a new week.

76
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,320
And this is Daily Source Code episode 479.

77
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,320
A lot of interesting stuff to work through today,

78
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:29,320
because you guys have been really doing my work for me, helping me out with the two main conversations.

79
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,320
Nothing on North Korea today.

80
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,320
Do you have some grammatical stuff to talk about?

81
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Grammar, specifically.

82
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,320
And more on Corey Lydle, because I was waiting,

83
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,320
but finally we got one of our aviation buffs to check in,

84
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,320
who was actually flown the East Corridor,

85
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,320
so we'll be hearing from Robin from Inside Works in a couple minutes.

86
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,320
And of course, the typical other stuff that drops into the email box

87
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
to the voice mail box.

88
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
I had a time in tune here.

89
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
I wanted to let you know.

90
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,320
I found out whether I'm a folder or a scruncher.

91
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,320
I went along to the folder or scruncher.com website that you recommended.

92
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,320
And it didn't tell me anything at all about how to figure out which I am.

93
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
But I did do.

94
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,320
I went on to wikipedia.org and there's an entry there called Toilet to Paper.

95
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,320
And it tells you whether you're a folder or a scruncher.

96
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,320
And I can't believe these scrunchers, what they do.

97
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,320
I mean, how on earth do they think that, well, oh my goodness.

98
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,320
Anyway, yeah, so anybody wants to find out which they are,

99
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,320
then go along to wikipedia.org and have a look at Toilet Paper.

100
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,320
And Adam, I hope you weren't too offended by that video impression thing.

101
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
I did a view.

102
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,320
I really looking forward to the launch of the BT Pot Show,

103
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Pot Show in the UK.

104
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,320
So how is that going, by the way?

105
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Okay, thanks Adam.

106
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
And folder.

107
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
Yeah.

108
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
Another one.

109
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Another one joins the ranks of folders.

110
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
Yeah, BT Pot Show going very well.

111
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,320
Looks like we're going to be opening up the doors first or second week of November.

112
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,320
As we get closer to this specific data, let you know.

113
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,320
It's going, it's, I've already seen what it looks like, of course, on the inside.

114
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
And it looks fantastic.

115
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
Here, I think you're really going to dig it.

116
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
I mean, it's, is it that different from Pot Show.com?

117
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
No, of course not.

118
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,320
It's all part of the same system, but it is specifically marketed for the UK.

119
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,320
The choices on the homepage for the UK.

120
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,320
And along with this launch, we're also going to be releasing or unleashing new features for

121
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,320
Pot Show.com in general for Pot Show plus new, new design stuff.

122
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
There's all kinds of things coming.

123
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,320
If I can just get my health back, then it will be fantastic.

124
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
You're always really interesting.

125
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,320
I've done 11 exercises now with Amy Mack.

126
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,320
And I didn't realize this.

127
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,320
But a lot of people actually think that Amy Mack is there with me in the studio or in the cottage

128
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
when we do those exercises.

129
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Of course, the full intention be to get my ass back in shape.

130
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,320
And then the one time we actually do something that is set up.

131
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,320
So it sounds like Amy actually entered the curry condo the other day.

132
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,320
Now everyone's saying that that was fake.

133
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Yeah, duh.

134
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,320
Please, you really thought that she was there at 6.30 in the morning?

135
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,320
Yeah.

136
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
Some ex-gives from Newcastle UK.

137
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Oh, okay, everyone.

138
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,320
Amy Mack was so, obviously, not bad, but that was terrible.

139
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
He's an active person.

140
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
Put anywhere there, you go anywhere there.

141
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,320
Anyway, let me get some cool going quickly for my show at theboardjordy.proxual.com.

142
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
I've got 13 listeners in a minute.

143
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
And it's really good music.

144
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Great stuff.

145
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
There's a mix of everything.

146
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
Get yourself an input.

147
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Go on.

148
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
Quickly.

149
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
Actions.

150
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
Go on.

151
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Go on.

152
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,320
Yeah, I wonder, you know, how much of that you did not understand if you're listening

153
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,320
to this and your U.S. citizen and living in America?

154
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,320
I really noticed that, and some people actually picked up on that.

155
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,320
They say, hey, you know, when you're in America, you're your accent changes.

156
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,320
And you obviously, you know, when I'm totally assimilated into the UK culture, when

157
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
I'm in the cottage.

158
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
But I really have no problem understanding that.

159
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
And I know sometimes I'll be laughing about stuff.

160
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
And I can see a look around the room.

161
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,320
And I look at U.S.

162
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
Potshow colleagues.

163
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,320
And I can just see the puzzlement on their, the wilderness on their faces.

164
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,320
Because you really have to focus into it and really have to tune into to listen.

165
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
You know, as they say, it's, uh,

166
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
two, what is it?

167
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,320
Two countries divided by common language.

168
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,320
I think that's where it is.

169
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Well, you know that, of course, is the whole premise for now.

170
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
We're from our spine.

171
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Yeah, exactly.

172
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
It's the X versus the Brits.

173
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
Well, the Bible.

174
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
We'll drive each other crazy.

175
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,320
But everybody knows that it's apparent to see.

176
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,320
Let's just like you and me.

177
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,320
It's the X and the Brits.

178
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
Yeah.

179
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,320
The X versus the Brits.

180
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,320
Mind the gap.

181
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
So not that this is really a yanks versus the Brits.

182
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
But, you know, I did promise myself.

183
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,320
I was going to work a lot more on using my vocabulary and expressing myself with my American accent.

184
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,320
Much more in the fashion that the residents of the UK do.

185
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,320
And in order to do that, I have to have my language skills.

186
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,320
My grammar has to be kind of correct because this is the proper queens English.

187
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,320
Or is it the kings English?

188
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,320
And a question arose about the use of me or I in a sentence.

189
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,320
Boy, we got a lot of people out there who are pretty angled about language.

190
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
Hey, Adam.

191
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,320
This is Paul Barry from the window to the magic.com podcast.

192
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,320
And I was just listening to BFC number 477, where you were talking about the Karla and me.

193
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
Karla and I.

194
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,320
And you said you were always taught that it was always in certain name and I.

195
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,320
The way that I was taught that was that if you remove the other person, it should make sense.

196
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,320
So if you say Karla and me went to the store, that would not be correct.

197
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,320
Because if you took away Karla and you would not say me went to the store.

198
00:12:51,320 --> 00:13:00,320
But if you said, I went to the store and you know, and Johnny ran into Karla and me,

199
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,320
that would be correct because Johnny ran into me.

200
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,320
You wouldn't say Johnny ran into I.

201
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,320
So, you know, maybe that that will be an easy way for you to remember.

202
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,320
Just take away the extra person and say it again in your head.

203
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,320
And if it makes sense, then that that would be the way you want to go with it.

204
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,320
I'm not 100% sure that that's right, but that's how I was taught.

205
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,320
So hope it helps and keep up the good work.

206
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Thank you.

207
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
Thank you.

208
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,320
Yeah, remember when when we first moved to the States and Patricia, of course,

209
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
speaks fantastic English.

210
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,320
She really wanted to do much much better for her own, you know,

211
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,320
she felt that she wasn't up to where she wanted to be in communicating in the English language.

212
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,320
And so I would speak English with her exclusively.

213
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,320
And we'd go through these things to say, well, why is it like this?

214
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
Why do you say it that way?

215
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,320
And you know what all I could say is, I don't know, it just feels right.

216
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,320
That's the way I was taught and it kind of just feels right.

217
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,320
There's so many exceptions to every rule.

218
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,320
So I'm sure this will be a debate or a conversation that continues for quite a while.

219
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:11,320
By the way, do you know what actually people are in New York or talking about?

220
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
And are talking about sponsoring?

221
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,320
It's really cool.

222
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,320
I'm a sponsor.

223
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,320
We actually have multiple brands competing over the sponsorship of folder scruncher.

224
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
And we're coming out.

225
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,320
I can't even tell you what's how cool this is going to be.

226
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,320
We're coming out with something interesting because this is a worldwide phenomenon.

227
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,320
It was even on the Gilmore gang.

228
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,320
If you haven't heard it, the five episodes that are titled Friday the 13th gang.

229
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:51,320
I was that was recorded on Friday the 13th last Friday and released on Sunday.

230
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
I've got to listen to this show.

231
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,320
I think it was one of the most entertaining Gilmore gangs ever ever recorded.

232
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:05,320
The very little content about industry industry issues, as it pertains to web 2.0 and

233
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,320
Office is dead and all the other interesting stuff that they discuss on the Gilmore gang.

234
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,320
But man, when you put Jason Calcana and myself together, would it be Jason and I?

235
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,320
Yes, Jason Calcana and I together.

236
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,320
There's a very significant Laurel and Hardy effect that takes place.

237
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,320
And actually, I should find that for you.

238
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,320
I should let you hear when Jason Calcana does an impression.

239
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,320
His Adam Curry impression is so impeccable.

240
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,320
It is so right on.

241
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
You got to listen to it.

242
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,320
Gilmore gang.podshow.com.

243
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:43,320
So finally, I got the feedback I was looking for.

244
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,320
Out of all the news reports, all the in-depth analysis,

245
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
all the NTSB stuff.

246
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:55,320
Finally, we have a pilot who has been up the East River New York corridor in a light aircraft.

247
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,320
I had the pictures to prove it because Robin from inside works.

248
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,320
Actually, I just found these on my desk just the other day before we left for New York.

249
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,320
Beautiful, beautiful pictures of him flying.

250
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:11,320
When the twin towers were still there, flying a tail dragger around the statue of liberty.

251
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
So he has clearly done this route.

252
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,320
And what you're about to hear is really the best explanation that I've heard yet of what happened.

253
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:28,320
And it appears to be just a very, very, very unfortunate accident due to more than likely lack of experience

254
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,320
in flying in this particular bit of airspace, which is very tricky.

255
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,320
And as with everything, you know, it doesn't take much to trip up and to have a whole bunch of things go wrong

256
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
all at one time.

257
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:50,320
The one piece that I'm still not clear on is they were so many reports of a distress call regarding fuel,

258
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:57,320
which I believe now is just not true because I've not heard this confirmed by NTSB.

259
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,320
I did go on the NTSB website and there is a preliminary report.

260
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,320
There was no report whatsoever of distress call going out.

261
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,320
So you can just see how poorly the media works.

262
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,320
And by the way, I've made several analyses of this accident myself,

263
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:17,320
and which I believe turned out to be pretty much, well, in essence correct,

264
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,320
but I just did not have enough facts.

265
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,320
As I've said, over and over again, I really don't have all the facts.

266
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,320
And I've never flown in that particular bit of airspace,

267
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,320
but I think Robin can really lay it down for us.

268
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,320
And we'll have a listen.

269
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,320
Hey, I'm Mrs. Robin from InsightWorks and TheDivaCast.com.

270
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,320
Two things come to mind about the Cory crash in New York City.

271
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:49,320
First off, I really want to give our condolences to the family of Cory and the flight instructor.

272
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:56,320
But the two things I want to say, I flew into New York, which is just west of New York City.

273
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,320
That day, just a couple hours after the crash,

274
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,320
I have to say it was a really blustery day about time we got there.

275
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,320
So I expect earlier, in the time of the crash,

276
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,320
as it's been described, you know, overcast skies,

277
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,320
winds out of the east is probably a very blustery day,

278
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,320
because by the time I got there, it was a heavy rain, nasty, nasty weather.

279
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,320
Second point is, I have flown in those VFR quarters that you've talked about.

280
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,320
I've flown in my airlines antique 1931 Curtis Wright travel air,

281
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:32,320
and we took off out of JFK. We flew up the Hudson across the central park

282
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
and then down the east river.

283
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,320
Just through that exact same area where Cory was.

284
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,320
We've been talking to a LaGuardia tower,

285
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,320
and I have to say they're not always the friendlyest folks,

286
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,320
as you might expect in New York where it's always so busy in the airspace.

287
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,320
So I can imagine flying up the east river talking to LaGuardia.

288
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,320
You have clouds above you, winds from the east, city to the left,

289
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,320
LaGuardia airspace to the north and to the east.

290
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,320
You're getting close to the point where you look where you're going to let

291
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,320
us continue further north up the east river,

292
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,320
and then LaGuardia says, no, serious.

293
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,320
We're not going to let you come in here.

294
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,320
Stay clear of our airspace.

295
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
Well, what are you going to do?

296
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,320
And I'm going to turn east towards the airport.

297
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,320
You're going to turn west towards the city.

298
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,320
And if you're in that VFR quarter,

299
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,320
you're probably favoring the right side,

300
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,320
as we do here in the stage five and in a car.

301
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,320
It's not like you in England.

302
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,320
But you're going to favor the right side of the river,

303
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,320
and so you're naturally going to turn left towards the center of the river,

304
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,320
and make a left hand turn to head back south down the river.

305
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,320
Well, if you have a tailwind, like you were talking about,

306
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,320
what's it going to do?

307
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,320
It's going to push you right towards the city.

308
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,320
There are inclinations going to be a pull harder,

309
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,320
and I think that may be what actually happened.

310
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,320
They had a larger turning radius than they expected,

311
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,320
pulled a little bit harder,

312
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,320
and maybe got into a stall spend situation.

313
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,320
So that's my gut feel as to what may have happened.

314
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,320
I hate to play, you know,

315
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,320
the Monday quarterback in the whole situation,

316
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,320
and again, my best wishes and thoughts

317
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,320
to the families of all those involved.

318
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,320
There's Robin again,

319
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,320
he used to call you from the cockpit on my way in the 757 or 757.

320
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,320
Home today, but out tomorrow.

321
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,320
So long, older.

322
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,320
All right, Robin.

323
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,320
Thank you so much, dude.

324
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,320
So hearing that really puts a whole new perspective

325
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,320
on what took place there.

326
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,320
And quite honestly, I think, you know,

327
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,320
from what I've read,

328
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,320
there's now been a decision to close the east corridor

329
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,320
for fixed wing VFR traffic,

330
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,320
so small.

331
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,320
Well, that's the only type of traffic

332
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,320
that they can really get in there,

333
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,320
VFR to be quite honest.

334
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,320
So they're going to close that up.

335
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,320
And in this case,

336
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,320
maybe the right decision would have been to veer left

337
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,320
if at all possible,

338
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,320
who knows what is going on.

339
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,320
And then maybe still turn east into the wind,

340
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,320
because I believe there was quite a crosswind component there.

341
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,320
I think there was, you know, 15 knots

342
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,320
in order to be able to make the turn,

343
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,320
probably would have been a little bit easier to make the tight turn

344
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,320
if they hung it to the east instead of to the west.

345
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,320
It is very, very unfortunate.

346
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,320
And I think it is good to discuss these things, actually,

347
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,320
because this is how we keep other people alive.

348
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,320
And I'm a big believer in going over accidents

349
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
and understanding what went wrong,

350
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,320
and obviously trying not to get into the same situation myself.

351
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,320
All right, you know what?

352
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,320
I'm just going to wind this show up with the request,

353
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,320
actually, that came in through the email.

354
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,320
Hello, Adam.

355
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
It's Martin, H.K.A.D. from G.D.

356
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,320
by its size bonus.

357
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,320
Not wanting to steal your official news ecologists from there.

358
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,320
But I thought, so I'd come on for a Friday

359
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
and recommend a song for you.

360
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Well, at least a band.

361
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,320
And the band is called Superkicks.

362
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,320
They've just uploaded a couple of tracks

363
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,320
for the pot-said music network.

364
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,320
I think they're going really well on Fuba.

365
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,320
I've been promoting them on my podcast last day

366
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
to nine months.

367
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,320
Absolutely terrific band, full of energy.

368
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,320
And what's even better,

369
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,320
from your Nicola Woods in Suri,

370
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,320
so go on, give them a play.

371
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,320
Superkicks on the Charlie on Fuba Friday.

372
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,320
Alright, one more thing.

373
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,320
I hope you feel better soon.

374
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,320
One thing is, it's not Friday, but who cares?

375
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,320
We can do a football any day we like.

376
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,320
Now you're gone, I'll need you now.

377
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,320
If I could only show you now,

378
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,320
if I don't get thrown away.

379
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,320
Come on and make me.

380
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
If they give up big shot,

381
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
but you're not.

382
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
You say you can take me.

383
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
Knock it take y'all,

384
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
and shit you got.

385
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
What is it better?

386
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,320
What is it better?

387
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,320
Why is it better?

388
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,320
To me now,

389
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
Why is it better?

390
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
Why is it better?

391
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
To me now,

392
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
y'all, y'all,

393
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
I need you now.

394
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,320
If I could only show you now,

395
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,320
if I don't get thrown away.

396
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,320
Come and run and run and away.

397
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,320
Run and run and run and away.

398
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,320
Run and run and run and away.

399
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,320
Never come back,

400
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,320
because it won't be the same again.

401
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
Come on and make you and me.

402
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,320
Try to refuse me,

403
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,320
you want to say again.

404
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
Come and get me with me.

405
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,320
I'm not gonna fall for that again.

406
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
Why is it better?

407
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,320
Why does it matter?

408
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,320
Why does it matter to me now?

409
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,320
Why does it matter?

410
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,320
Here we go.

411
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,320
What is it better to me now?

412
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
Now y'all, y'all,

413
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,320
I need you now.

414
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,320
If I could only show you now,

415
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,320
if I don't get thrown away.

416
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,320
When y'all, y'all,

417
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,320
I see the light,

418
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,320
the million pounds of naked bright,

419
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
but y'all,

420
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,320
we have another day.

421
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,320
Run and run and run and away.

422
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,320
Run and run and run and away.

423
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,320
Run and run and run and away.

424
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,320
Run and run and away.

425
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,320
Super kicks,

426
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
get blown away.

427
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,320
Winding up this episode of the Daily Source Code,

428
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,320
coming to you from New York City,

429
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,320
apologies again for the sound quality,

430
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,320
but it's the mobile setup.

431
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
Was either there so using the wireless mic,

432
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
so I'm gonna wrap it up.

433
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,320
Also, if you check out that Gilmore gang episode,

434
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,320
I was talking about,

435
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,320
it was so interesting.

436
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,320
We got into a conversation about pod shows advertising platform,

437
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
and how we basically, how we make money.

438
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
And I said,

439
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,320
you know, our advertising becomes content.

440
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,320
And I didn't even have to reference the Splendor campaign.

441
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
Oh, excuse me.

442
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,320
God, I feel like shit.

443
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,320
I didn't even have to reference the Splendor campaign.

444
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,320
I think by the end of the show,

445
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
which is about an hour and a half,

446
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,320
I would not be exaggerating if I counted

447
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,320
the use of the word Splendor 50 times.

448
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
Unbelievable.

449
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
How good this stuff is working.

450
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,320
And you guys just keep this campaign going.

451
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,320
There's so much you have to say about this product.

452
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
It's really phenomenal.

453
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,320
So we'll do more of that tomorrow.

454
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,320
And, well, of course,

455
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,320
daily sourcecode.com is the website where you can go get all the show notes.

456
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,320
And Adam at podshow.com is where you can send me all your love and poetry.

457
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,320
So take care, everybody.

458
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,320
I will talk to you tomorrow.

459
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,320
Bye from New York.

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
