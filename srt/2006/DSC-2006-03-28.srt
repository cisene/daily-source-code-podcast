$60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Are you my rally show? Are you the answer to my question? I have always been my time now

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Because if I feel this feeling, but you call out of your perspective, I'm scared of calling the mind

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Will you shine? Will you be my life? Because I can't see someone

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I can't feel crying more, I can't see someone

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But I don't mind, you're by my side, I feel fine

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I feel fine

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I feel fine

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I can't shout to you to be alone

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Hey, shout in your heart, silly little stone

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Hey, baby, I can't see you

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Baby, I can't hear you calling me calling

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I can't see someone

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Can't feel drugs anymore

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I can't see someone anymore

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But I don't mind, I go blind

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I can't see someone

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I can't feel crying more

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I can't see someone

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But I don't mind, you're by my side, I feel fine

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I feel fine

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I can't see someone

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I can't see someone

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's from Montana, the call to the sun

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Go, check, go

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh man, it's good to be back, I'm at the hell of processor

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It calls themselves black lab

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's see the sun, of course it's podsafe

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
From the podsafe music network and music.pot show.com

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Let me just hit a button here, let me see something

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I take that mixer with me everywhere I go

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I really got to get a second set up in San Francisco

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This is ridiculous, I keep setting everything up again

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It sounds a little funky, it could just be my ears as usual

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Welcome to the daily source code

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What is on from the cottage in the affluent suburb?

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
How many people hate me saying that?

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The affluent suburb of Gilford and Surrey in the United Kingdom

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's unbelievable, I have castblaster completely lined up today

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Everything is, every single slot is filled up

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Because actually yesterday I had prep the show

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I got up, I was really out of whack from the travel

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I got up relatively early, of course

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And I slept a little bit on Sunday and in and out of consciousness

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Is what you could call it more likely

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And I prepped everything and I got to go to London

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Because I had to go to the guardian

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Changing media summit I think is what it was called

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Which was something that was agreed to a long time ago

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The dates actually changed

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I thought it would be interesting because I was invited to sit on a panel

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
With the head of BBC interactive radio

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And I'm forgetting if he was the president of the president of interactive

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I believe a virgin radio

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And the whole thing was mediated by a senior editor from the guardian

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And let me tell you

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Very interesting, although I thought the conference by itself

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Was probably mediocre at best

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm not quite sure who was for it, kept asking who was in the audience

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And to say well it felt like just a lot of broadcasters in general

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We're in the audience people who wanted to learn about social networking

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
About podcasting about the future radio and all these

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I mean really if you just keep up reading a little bit online

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Then you probably could have gotten a lot of the questions

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Answered that were I guess we're brought up yesterday

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And the session was really short, it was like 40 minutes

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Maybe I could barely get into it

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It was so interesting I said well you know

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We have our 550 rule within five years

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
50% of all content consumed by people will be made by the same people

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Consuming it and it was like

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Man, you could have heard of it

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
In fact I said you could hear a pin drop, couldn't you

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And it was like completely dead silent

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What was really nice about yesterday is I met a couple other people

110
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
A Joe twist was there

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
She showed up because I know her for a long time her and castle

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Robert Dolby from top of the pods was there

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That was great it was very interesting to meet him

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Very enthusiastic guy

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I met another guy later on

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And you know just listening to one of the BBC is about to start as from what I understand

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's about to start with a huge podcasting trial

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And I'm not quite sure how long it's going to last or what they're going to do

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But they're actually going to call it podcasting which is new for the BBC

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And I'm thinking man it's like

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The opportunities upon us my friends

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
There's a lot of alternative content waiting to get out

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And I think if we had the right partners and we had the right tactics

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I think we could really open up the UK market to podcasting

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Now I feel it's primed and it's just about ready

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So I'm excited about a lot of the prospects

127
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
A lot of the things that I heard and felt yesterday

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Tells me that it really is time to break into the market

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And I wouldn't mind having a London office to go to once in a while

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So that's what we're working on

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Before I forget about black lab

132
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That was a suggestion sent to me by Artith Makala

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
who sent me a Gmail and it was perfect

134
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Adam longtime listener of the DSC

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Really enjoy Monday mornings when I open iTunes and see your new podcasts there

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But you really need to play more rock with a hard stretch

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Get back to your head bangers ball days

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And hence the suggestion black lab with the see this on

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Thank you very much

140
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You'd be amazed how easy it is for me when people send me suggestions

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Send me a link to the podcast and music network as well

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
For whatever suggestion you send in and it works man

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It does thank you appreciate it

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Adam it's Callie

145
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Hey Callie

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm sick

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We both must have got something on the plane

149
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You mean you mean you and Neil not you and I both dear

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Been in bed since one day which should be fun

151
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But it's not

152
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I've been wanting to try and try and get my day at Part Show up

153
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But when neither of us can concentrate long enough to do it

154
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So thank you and I want to go any longer

155
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Without saying thank you for having me out to San Francisco

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We had a great time and I appreciate everything you guys did

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I feel better Callie

158
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I feel really horrible that you're sick

159
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He must have been something you picked up on the plane

160
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Because everyone at Part Show has already been sick

161
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We've had all everyone's been sick

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So can't be us we're past the incubation period

163
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I hope you feel better

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'd say a geek brief pop up but I guess that wasn't the San Francisco one

165
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So yeah I know what that can be like man

166
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That sucks

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You know it's so weird but I'm just trying to figure out

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Somehow it just doesn't sound the way it used to

169
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I got tons and tons of promos

170
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
As I said you know I had everything prepared yesterday

171
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And you just you know it's

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It drives me nuts

173
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You guys are feeding me so much information

174
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The Delta Sierra Charlie

209
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Am I boy a lady?

210
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000

211
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000

Where it comes from

215
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But as far as the folks who don't know

216
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The other Sierra Charlie is the

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Fanetic alphabet for the military

218
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Mm-hmm

219
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So that you when you speak and teach other over the

220
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Over the airways on your radios

221
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
That you don't confuse

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
S with a

223
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't know

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
C or T or whatever

225
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So there's no confusion

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000

265
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000

Adam PD love from Love House

306
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Radio and interview with a stranger

307
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I just wanted to thank you for playing

308
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
My cop skid on DSC 356

309
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Last Monday

310
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And I wanted to know

311
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I keep hearing about the

312
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Charlie the Charlie

313
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And now the Golden Ticket

314
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You have a Wonka Complex

315
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Is there something going on there

316
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Little Chocolate Factory

317
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Hidden somewhere in your basement

318
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yeah

319
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Started to wonder with the Golden Ticket

320
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So I got a chocolate factory

321
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
My basement

322
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Uh-huh

323
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Tell us more please

324
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Tell us more

325
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Talks you later Adam

326
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Thanks a lot

327
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
All right

328
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah I'm almost forgot

329
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What

330
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yeah a lot of people picked up on that

331
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So the test is going to commence

332
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Tomorrow

333
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Had a back and forth with Andrew Grummit

334
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The legendary Andrew Grummit

335
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So tomorrow we're going to test out

336
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Our D-Gap system a little bit further

337
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Again it's just a test

338
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So she could go wrong

339
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And it could break and it could

340
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Anything could happen

341
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But this is just a test

342
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
We will attach a real prize to it

343
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It was a

344
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
A special super powered remote

345
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
For your iPod

346
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
An RF remote

347
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So not this silly little infrared

348
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But just something you can actually connect to your

349
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
iPod and you can change it via remote

350
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
From huge distances I'm told

351
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Ah

352
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Excuse me

353
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
A little heartburn there

354
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Uh-huh

355
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
The way the way it's going to work

356
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Or the way we're going to test it

357
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Should say is

358
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
One of the downloads of the Charlie

359
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
One of the complete downloads

360
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Will include a special piece of audio

361
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
In which I'll basically congratulate the person

362
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Because that person will have won the Golden Ticket

363
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And they'll be a phone number for them to call

364
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And they'll have to give us a secret code

365
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Doesn't really matter because only one person

366
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Can claim it and that's the first person who listen to it

367
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Um, and uh, and that'll be automatically inserted

368
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And everyone else won't hear that special piece of audio

369
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So, uh, it's just a test to see if we can make a work

370
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And what I'm really more interested in is

371
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Uh, of all the downloads

372
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Will the person who downloaded it

373
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Listen to it and actually call in with the code

374
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Um, so we'll make sure that within the first

375
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Day of release that it definitely will get downloaded

376
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Um, and then we'll just have to wait and see if someone finds it

377
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So, um, and it'll just only be for tomorrow's episode

378
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Of course in the future we're going to build this out

379
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It could be across multiple shows

380
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Could be across archives

381
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It can be anywhere within the podcast

382
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Uh, it's kind of be pretty cool

383
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm very excited about it

384
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Hey there Adam Howard Greenstein here in New York

385
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And I was listening to the Charlie 358 and 360

386
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And I heard you talking about the Golden Ticket

387
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That you're going to be giving away to one lucky

388
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Listener of the Daily Source Code

389
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And, um, I was talking about this with my kids

390
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And, you know, Willy Wonka is one of their favorite movies

391
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And, when I told them this they said

392
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Daddy, I want the Golden Ticket

393
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I said, you mean Adam Curry's Golden Ticket

394
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And they said Daddy, I want the Golden Ticket now

395
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I said, why do you want to Golden Ticket?

396
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I want to go to the Pod Show Factory

397
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And see Mr. Curry and watch him make all his pod shows

398
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
With all the little people running around

399
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And then the train squirrels in the chocolate

400
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And I said, it's not really like that

401
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
They don't really have a factory

402
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Adam actually has a cottage

403
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Daddy, I want the Golden Ticket

404
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Well, how's Daddy supposed to get you a Golden Ticket?

405
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I mean there's thousands and thousands of people listening to this podcast

406
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Daddy, get lots and lots of computers

407
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And download the Pod Show over and over again

408
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
To get the one with the Golden Ticket

409
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But, but that would take hours

410
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
By the way, it's not just the downloading

411
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That would take hours and hours

412
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You actually have to listen to each individual

413
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So this is how we're going to combat fraud

414
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Is it can be inserted anywhere within the program

415
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So you'd have to know where it would be inserted

416
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
So you'd have to listen to every single entire show

417
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So, yeah

418
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The Thousand Computers Daddy, I don't think that's going to work

419
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Daddy, I want the Golden Ticket now

420
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
See what you started Adam?

421
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't know what I'm going to do

422
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I really hope you get me that Golden Ticket, man

423
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And hey, when did my kids turn British?

424
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Anyway, peace

425
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
That's a very good question

426
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah, I guess I do have it

427
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Well, I think I've said before

428
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I really want it in the chart effect

429
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
My favorite movie of all time

430
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Of course the Gene Wilder version

431
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Although after many doubts I did check out the Johnny Deb version

432
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And actually like that one very much as well

433
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But still the original

434
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Nothing goes beyond that childhood fantasy

435
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Well, you've kids picking up on it, I dig that

436
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So hopefully tomorrow

437
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It'll all work out

438
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And somehow someone will get

439
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The Golden Ticket inserted

440
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And we'll win that wonderful

441
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Remote

442
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Which I'll plug tomorrow

443
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
When I get back to Sam Levin's email

444
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
To figure out what the name of the brand was

445
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So you've probably noticed across all these pod shows

446
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That we are plugging Go Daddy

447
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Really heavily, they've made a nice investment

448
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
In the podcasters who are on the podshow podcasent network

449
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And the cool thing about this one brand

450
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Many voices is that everyone's free and clear

451
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And open to communicate it

452
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
However they want to

453
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And man, there's been some

454
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
A Callie I saw

455
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Oh, talk about

456
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Rrrr

457
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Callie did a sponsored wardrobe change

458
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And slipped into the

459
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
String strap tank top

460
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
The Go Daddy String strap tank top

461
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I bought some domain names immediately

462
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Hi Adam, this is Safi

463
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000

Oh, you are

466
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And on Friday's Charlie

467
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You were talking about the Go Daddy girl

468
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Being on your list

469
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Well, I want you to know that you've been on my list

470
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Since the 80s

471
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Beware and all

472
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Hmm

473
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That's my wife

474
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Listen to Dorf Dishore at

475

476
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh man

477
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Patricia heard the show

478
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
She heard the show about

479
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
The Go Daddy girl being on my list

480
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And she said she was no match for Angelina Jolie

481
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And absolutely

482
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Could not be interchanged on the list

483
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So

484
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
That's a bummer

485
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But she made up for it last night

486
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
After the conference

487
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And yeah, I'll talk to the Go Daddy girl

488
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But my list is my dance card is now full

489
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
If you know what I mean

490
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And of course my buddy Jeff Smith checks in

492
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
In the only way Jeff Smith knows how to help out

493
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You're outrageous

556
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The Jeff Smith dot com

557
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And the Jeff Smith kiddies, I guess

558
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
His girls

559
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah, I've been talking to Jeff

560
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
We're gonna do more stuff

561
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You know, I think that

562
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Independent artists like this

563
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Also deserve a chance to quit their day job

564
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Man, you're just too good

565
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
There's too much good shit going on

566
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Love it

567
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Fantastic

568
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,500
Thank you very much.

569
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Okay, here's something very interesting

570
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
That I came across yesterday

571
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Now we kind of have our own little social network

572
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Excuse me, social media network going on with in Pod Show

573
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Chris McIntyre is usually the first one to spot stuff

574
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,500
And send it out

575
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
And he's saying that something

576
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
A link to an interesting press release

577
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
On an outfit called

578
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,500
Pod2Mob

579
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
As in Pod2Mobile

580
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Automated software solution

581
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,500
Transform podcasting from new medium to thriving marketplace

582
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
And so as I kind of skin through the release

583
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,500
I was like, I, okay, so this looks like another typical

584
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,500
You know, add insertion thing

585
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,500
I'm like, okay, that's really good

586
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Where are all the add insertions, by the way

587
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
The de-gap systems working

588
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
The go-daddy tags are in

589
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
I don't hear a lot of others being automatically inserted

590
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,500
So I'm always interested in just skimming through it

591
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
And in the release a couple things called my eye

592
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
The first one was according to business week

593
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Sequoia capital, which is one of our investors

594
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Police podcasting is positioned to capture

595
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
One to two billion dollars away from the 30 billion

596
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Dollar traditional radio advertising market

597
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Over the next three to five years

598
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,500
And so first like, wow, did Sequoia make an investment

599
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
And these guys and so no, they didn't make it

600
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,500
They just quoted the business week, okay, I thought

601
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
And then I read a little bit further

602
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,500
And Brad Zootout

603
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,500
Who is, I guess one of the founders of this company

604
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,500
Pod2Mob

605
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
It's quoted saying with our solution

606
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Anyone from a Fortune 500 company

607
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
To a blog with big ambitions

608
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,500
To a budding band can quickly and easily launch an ad campaign

609
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
That is highly targeted and affordable

610
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
And then they go into all this functionality

611
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
Whether you can insert

612
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
So basically what they do is they have a little application

613
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
Which you download for your phone

614
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,500
I couldn't test it myself because it's only for US carriers at the moment

615
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
You download that to your phone

616
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,500
They have a little directory in there

617
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
And you select something from the directory

618
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
And it starts playing on your mobile phone

619
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
No, in general, pretty good

620
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
I like the idea

621
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,500
And then reading in the functionality

622
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,500
They have podcasts category targeting for audio ads

623
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,500
Advertise a control panel for easy campaign

624
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,500
Creation, stat tracking, easy and cost effective means to launch

625
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Advertising campaign

626
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Ads can be submitted in broadcasts and 24 hours

627
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
All this stuff

628
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,500
I'm just okay, okay, I'll go over and check it out

629
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,500
Pod2Mob.com

630
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,500
And the first thing I noticed is they have a very nice endorsement

631
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
For the pod save music network

632
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
They have our pod save music network

633
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Headphone, head logo, plugged into their page there

634
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
So I thought, oh, that's nice

635
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,500
And I'm looking around like I don't see really anything for podcasters

636
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,500
It looks like this is pretty much all for advertisers

637
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
And I'm hunting around hunting around

638
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,500
And I'm thinking to myself, wait a minute

639
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,500
These guys are selling advertisements and podcasters

640
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,500
That they are streaming to mobile phones

641
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,500
And it appears that they're putting ads in front of that

642
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,500
And like hold on a second

643
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,500
So I sent out the email blast to everybody

644
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Yeah, so if you look at their website pod2Mob.com

645
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
It is pod2Mob.com

646
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,500
Listen to any podcast on your cell phone for free

647
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,500
And so immediately Andrew Grummit signed up

648
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,500
Downloaded the application to his podcast

649
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,500
And he recorded and it's funny

650
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,500
The daily source code is the first entry into their

651
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
They're so called directory

652
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,500
But if you search on Adam Currier Daily source code

653
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
It pops up as well on the phone

654
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,500
Mind you, that's pretty cool

655
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
And you have an account which is created online

656
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,500
But then when you fire up the daily source code

657
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,500
And Andrew actually recorded with a microphone next to the telephone

658
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
So it's a crappy quality

659
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,500
But this is what you hear

660
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
So we just heard this podcasters brought to you by

661
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,500
Modtones.com

662
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,500
And then my podcasters which has by itself

663
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,500
An ad in search of a podcasters

664
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,500
And it's a really good idea

665
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,500
So we just heard this podcasters brought to you by

666
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,500
Modtones.com

667
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,500
And then my podcasters which has by itself

668
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
An ad in search of a podcasters

669
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,500
Which has by itself an ad in search

670
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
And we're really a tag in search for go daddy

671
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,500
And that's p-dog there

672
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
With a go-dog with a go daddy

673
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,500
Now you'll hear

674
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
We'll give you a special code to get

675
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,500
Great discounts at go daddy

676
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,500
So now you'll hear the Delta Sierra Charlie

677
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
360 tag

678
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
Delta Sierra Charlie

679
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
360

680
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,500
Right so that was a Friday show

681
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,500
So these guys are stealing our content

682
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,500
They're stealing our shows and putting ads in front of them

683
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
And charging advertisers

684
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,500
Look guys

685
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
Stop immediately

686
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,500
I mean I truly believe just looking at the site

687
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,500
And looking at the press release and all the pieces

688
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,500
That you guys probably smart technologists

689
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Put together something really nice

690
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,500
It's not really spectacular what they've done

691
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,500
They basically it's a streaming playlist

692
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,500
So you're streaming in MP3

693
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,500
Down to your phone in a very low bit rate

694
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,500
And because it's a stream you can insert one thing into another

695
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,500
So it's not really a full file

696
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,500
But it's just an actual stream you're accessing

697
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,500
But they're putting ads and it even says this podcast is brought to you by

698
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,500
Modtones.com

699
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,500
I'm sorry you don't have that right

700
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,500
And I'm gonna be really easy about it

701
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,500
Because I really do believe you guys just miscalculated your opportunity

702
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,500
But you can't do that

703
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,500
You cannot take someone else's content and put ads in or around it

704
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
That's you know Jesus Christ

705
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
I got slapped by Jason Calc

706
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
Oh my god I can't believe I said that

707
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,500
I'm so sorry I apologize

708
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
I did not mean to use that name

709
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,500
It's only because I have a segment coming up about it later

710
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
That it triggered in my head

711
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,500
I've been trying I'm sorry

712
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,500
Apologize let me continue

713
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
Guys you cannot do this

714
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,500
This is my content

715
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500
I own it

716
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,500
You have no right to advertise on it

717
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,500
And by the way any podcast that you access through this pod to mob system

718
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
We'll have ads inserted into it

719
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,500
So I suggest you guys stop it immediately

720
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Close it off right now

721
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Rethink it because all you have to do is just ask

722
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:28,500
It's just ask podcasters to sign up with you to enable that to be sent through the wires

723
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,500
And otherwise you're gonna look at a humongous glass action suit

724
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
Which I don't think you want to get into

725
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,500
Because every single podcasters

726
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,500
Here's about this will be pissed off

727
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,500
It's wrong

728
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,500
It's just completely wrong

729
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,500
So send me an email at amercurry.com

730
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,500
Let me know what you guys are doing about this

731
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,500
But you cannot continue and it has to stop by tomorrow

732
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,500
Otherwise all kinds of people are gonna jump in action

733
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,500
Believe me

734
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
But I think we can solve this amongst ourselves

735
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
And we don't have to get lawyers involved

736
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,500
You just have to shut that down for now and figure out

737
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
How you get podcasters permission

738
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,500
To actually start inserting ads into their podcasters

739
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,500
Or before or after or whatever

740
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,500
Speaking of ads

741
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500
Hey hey be quiet

742
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,500
I've got an incoming transmission

743
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,500
Let's see if the computer can translate it

744
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
I think I got it

745
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
No amount of time you read one

746
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
Look at the third one from the star

747
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,500
I detect signs of life with higher forms of communication

748
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,500
Many life forms spread all over the planet

749
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,500
How do you think they communicate over such vast areas?

750
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
I'm detecting a worldwide grid

751
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,500
An incredibly secure high speed digital communication

752
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
And information super highway

753
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
Let's see if we can open a channel

754
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
I think I've got something

755
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
Welcome to earthlings

756
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,500
We provide the crucial link to planet earth

757
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
Earthlink

758
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Appealing to those on and off our planet

759
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
Make use of it

760
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Earthlink

761
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,500
You're a little early for a one-brand many voices

762
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,500
Quit your day job campaign for earthling

763
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,500
But I liked it so much

764
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,500
And these are starting to come through now

765
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,500
Who was I think was add on the curry comments

766
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Curried calm comments he set up some kind of system with delicious bookmarks

767
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,500
Anyway, so I think the end result is there's an RSS feed

768
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,500
Which is comprised of MP3s that are posted anywhere on the internet

769
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,500
But are tagged with delicious tags

770
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,500
Curry comments

771
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,500
And then they automatically show up in my

772
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,500
In my iTunes actually is where I have where I've subscribed to this

773
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,500
And it does work you know because a couple of things I picked up today

774
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Came from that feed so you know it is much more effective than email

775
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,500
It's just you know the publishing part I think is still a little bit too hard

776
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:02,500
But if you have something that if you have some kind of upload system and all you and you can actually attach delicious tags to it

777
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:08,500
And if it's for me put curry comments and it'll automatically flow into my media inbox

778
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,500
Which is what I'm calling that so system does work. I appreciate you setting it up

779
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,500
Speaking of the curry comments now it's all in older posts

780
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:23,500
But gosh man the the comments spammers have gotten to me

781
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,500
And I'm really not sure what to do about it, but it's horrible

782
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,500
And if you look at the entry for daily source code 208

783
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,500
I mean they hit that one really really hard

784
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,500
And it's all the same thing. It's like wow great site you have here. What a wonderful resource

785
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:43,500
Oh man I hate it. I really hate it. I wish you know I wish we could figure something out with that

786
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,500
I like the the concept of open comments and not having to register for

787
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:53,500
For leaving comments but man is it a pain in the ass and a lot of talk about my space everywhere

788
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:58,500
And I just had a minor epiphany about my space parents are very worried. You know another finding out that

789
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,500
Oh, it's all this inappropriate stuff that's going on and

790
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:07,500
And everyone is calling for legislation and FCC rulings and you know hey look parents

791
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,500
Let me just say something about this if you want to know what your kids are doing

792
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,500
And get on my space and look at it and hunt around you know

793
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,500
You can't governments are even more backwards than then parents are when it comes to technology

794
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,500
They're way way behind most governments. I would have to say

795
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,500
So if you want to know what your kids are doing if you want to form an opinion

796
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:36,500
Don't get it from people magazine or USA today get on my space my space.com hunt around and you know and start a profile and

797
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,500
And see what happens and if you really really really don't like it

798
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:48,500
If you really disagree please don't go running to your senator and your congressman and and you know and and yelling around about how this is

799
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:54,500
Ridiculous and it's hurting our kids hey parents of the world get on my space and make it the most boring place in the world and kids

800
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,500
A little go away all by themselves. You can shut my space down in ten days

801
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,500
If all of the parents got on and started creating really parenty profiles

802
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:11,500
I'm just sick and tired of hearing about parents calling to the government to help them with what their kids are into

803
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:17,500
You'd lazy asses lazy lazy lazy lazy figured out for yourself will you get on my space good

804
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:23,500
I got a nice long email from Ray Lane who's one of our board of directors. He's from

805
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:29,500
Clienter Perkins he used to run Oracle have a lot of respect for this guy and

806
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:38,500
He listens to the Charlie. I think that he got the message about about the secret board of director member of the day and he's now back up to date

807
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:44,500
He's he's he's he's synchronized. I think he's heard every Charlie and he's up to speed up until Friday

808
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:51,500
Even the videos and he had some really good feedback and and I appreciate that and even had feedback on a comic strip blogger

809
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,500
And he says, you know, I really like this comic strip blogger, you know, although I think the

810
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:03,500
Paraphrasing here it sounds like he's sucking your dick too much now, which of course is true. I told CSB to dial it down from 11 to about five

811
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:09,500
And you know, and he's cranked it up just a little bit have to say the stuff that he's talking about on the on the comments

812
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:17,500
Although it's still very heated and a lot of words and allegations are thrown out there that well it's CSB so you know what you get with him

813
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:23,500
He doesn't know a lot about Europe and the EU and the EU laws and what's changing and how it's supposed to work and which countries are

814
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:28,500
Are in and out and half in and I find that extremely interesting and

815
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Well, you know, this is leaving up to don't you comic strip

816
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,500
Ladies and gentlemen, the following comment from comic strip blogger is definitely not family safe

817
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:45,500
So you may want to shield young ears and protect them from the comments from comic strip blogger

818
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:51,020
Hey Adam Kerry, so I have noticed that you were present as speaker at that media

819
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
Sammy organized by those commis

820
00:33:54,500 --> 00:34:02,500
So he's talking about the guardian media summit that was at yesterday, which is he's saying are those commis the guardian?

821
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,500
Well, let me remind you that in UK there is such a thing as of come

822
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:15,500
Something similar to FCC but in UK and read your present is in UK during phone in a scared like hell

823
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,500
That if they let us something uncensored then off come we'll dump them

824
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,500
So I had to listen to that two times before I understood it

825
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,500
But there's an organization here called off com which he says like the FCC

826
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,500
I thought there were more like the ANC trade and FCC kind of combined into one

827
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
But so apparently

828
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:42,500
What he's saying is it organizations like the guardian are afraid of off com because they have so much incredible power and can change you know policy here in the UK

829
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,500
And that's why I guess the conference was lame is that what he's saying?

830
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:51,500
Yeah mate, there is no fucking freedom of speech in UK off com kills it

831
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,500
So to foster freedom of speech in UK and as well here is little joke from me

832
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,500
Do you know what do you call it if you have nuts on the wall

833
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,500
Well nuts

834
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,500
Okay, and how do you call it if you have nuts in the urine?

835
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
In the urinal

836
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,500
This cannot be leaning anywhere good. Here comes the non safe fart

837
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:17,500
P nuts. Oh, okay, and how do you call it if you have nuts on the chest?

838
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,500
Then you call it cock in your mouth

839
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:26,500
No, yeah, mate fuck FCC USA and fuck off com in UK fuck them

840
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:32,500
And if we can't fuck them through regular radio because fucking off com blocks freedom

841
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,500
Then let's fuck them through podcasting fuck yeah

842
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
Okay, so USB

843
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:43,500
So if I'm looking through all the the efforts there the F bombs

844
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,500
You're saying that off com limits freedom of speech in the UK very interesting

845
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:53,500
I'd love to hear from some of the UK podcasters what their stance is on off com

846
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,500
Where are you guys I got a lot of promos and stuff but

847
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:04,500
Let me know which where you stand on these kinds of issues UK podcasters looking for you. We're looking for you

848
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:10,500
And the podshow podcast network making some waves with one of our new members the strip

849
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:16,500
Which is the podcast from and about Las Vegas just the day and they had a celebrity on their show

850
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:22,500
An honest to God celebrity an MSM mainstream media celebrity Dennis Miller

851
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:27,500
Hey, it's Miles from the strip on this week's show. We had Dennis Miller take a listen

852
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:34,500
Now I was at the famous Andre Agatha the grand fan for children fundraiser in 2003 when you did the routine

853
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
Yes, we're getting a lot of laughs

854
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,500
You know, that's the odd thing to me about it

855
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:44,500
I don't remember doing poorly there. I think I killed you had some choice words for the N. I wore it

856
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,500
It would write when the war was starting and Hillary Clinton and the French and all this and later in the show

857
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:53,500
Alton John told the audience that when people say why do they hate us so much? Dennis Miller

858
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,500
All right, were you surprised by that? Were you sitting backstage listening to it?

859
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
No, I said not the crowd listening to that

860
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,500
So what were you surprised so you take them take a nap?

861
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:07,500
Yeah, you know, I don't John and I don't know each other for man and from what I gather he's a bit of a TV fellow to begin with

862
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,500
Yeah, you know, I don't like my name being used in vain like that, you know, don't know him from Adam please

863
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,500
Seems to get angry periodically

864
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:19,500
That's fine with me. All I wish he would have acknowledged is it wasn't like when I left that stage

865
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
It wasn't going well

866
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,500
I think I killed so it wasn't that incendiary in the language

867
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:29,500
Well, you would say that you don't know him and Madonna does know him and he called her you know a fat horse

868
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
Something recently, so he's clearly none

869
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,500
Yeah, I think his MO is to be a bit of a crank on it so long

870
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:43,500
And you don't want right I'll just be honest with you as much as I love your song and burned down the mission and some will you connection

871
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,500
I could not care less what else

872
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
Thanks to me

873
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
It just doesn't matter to me

874
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,500
Next week how we manned out and don't forget to visit us at thestrippodcast.com

875
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,500
So what I like about the strip is that these celebrities they're in Vegas

876
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,500
And when you're in Vegas, you know things start to get loose and you start to like you know have fun

877
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:08,500
And shit happens and people open up and they're happy to talk and these guys are right there and everybody's face

878
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,500
And you know, and I'm sure that people are going out if it could's a phone or it's a podcast, whatever

879
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,500
But wow, you know, that wasn't pretty choice words

880
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,500
And I missed that whole bruhaha between Elton and Dennis Mill

881
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,500
I'm quite happy

882
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,500
I'm honestly

883
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,500
I'm starting to care less and less about that kind of stuff

884
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:29,500
You know, I was watching and I was at entertainment tonight or action entertainment or there's a million entertainment shows

885
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,500
When I was at the condo

886
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,500
And I'm just listening all these stories, I just don't care

887
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,500
I really don't

888
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:40,500
You know, it's the same about mainstream music, top 40 and just I really, I like the songs

889
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
I just don't care, I can get into it

890
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,500
But I really don't care like the way I care about what we're doing

891
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,500
It's because of comments like this

892
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,500
Hey Adam, this is Jim, I'm a longtime listener and I love your show

893
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:56,500
I wanted to bring to your attention and upcoming milestone that you're going to be hitting

894
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,500
On Friday you will be releasing if I'm not mistaken

895
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,500
The Charlie number 365

896
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,500
This means you have

897
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,500
Developed a year's worth of material

898
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,500
I bring this up for an interesting point

899
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,500
It's about 530 in the morning here in Hong Kong on Tuesday

900
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,500
I just woke up about an hour ago, couldn't sleep

901
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,500
I got here yesterday from San Francisco

902
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,500
And I was really looking forward to playing this morning's Charlie

903
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,500
While I was getting ready and doing some email

904
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,500
Unfortunately, I see it hasn't been posted yet

905
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,500
Now I think with a year's worth of catalog to draw from

906
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,500
You could have Uncle Jesse together some

907
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,500
Best of Charlie's or maybe in box

908
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
Anyway, I hope you enjoy your vacation next week

909
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,500
And maybe you can have a P.W. Take a look at doing this for you

910
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,500
Take care, again, love the show

911
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,500
Oh no, oh no, it's him

912
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,500
You called Uncle Jesse and the jingle comes out

913
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,500
The sad light repair man coming after you

914
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,500
Sad light repair man, what's he going with him

915
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,500
He'll fit your misconceptions and answer questions too

916
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,500
There's nothing in the universe that he can't do for you

917
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,500
Sad light repair man

918
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,500
What?

919
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,500
He might

920
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,500
Sad light repair man

921
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,500
Yeah

922
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,500
Everybody

923
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,500
Another P.W. is here right now

924
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,500
Because he's waiting another nine minutes

925
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,500
Until my satellite window for today closes

926
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
And P.W.

927
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,500
You know, it's all in jazz man, we love you

928
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,500
You're not just a sad light repair man, of course

929
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,500
You're not

930
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,500
You're not just

931
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,500
Uncle Jesse

932
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,500
You're much more than that

933
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:40,500
Hi, this is P.W. Fenton

934
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,500
And I'd like to invite you to go to digitalflotsom.org

935
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,500
And acquaint yourself with my podcast Digital Flotsom

936
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,500
It's an eclectic mix of music and talk

937
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,500
That will sometimes make you laugh

938
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,500
And sometimes make you cry

939
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,500
But it will always make you listen

940
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:02,500
Hello my Royal subjects, now it's not Christmas

941
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,500
But I do invite you to join me this and every weekend

942
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,500
Watching the maximum newest video sandbox

943
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,500
We are highly amused

944
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,500
I feel really bad, I messed it up man

945
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,500
I messed it up earlier in the show

946
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,500
I said something that I had really been trying not to say

947
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,500
And I was doing so good

948
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,500
Let's talk about it now

949
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,500
Hey Adam Steve Web here with the Life Spring Plancast

950
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,500
Hey it seems as if I've started a mini thread

951
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
On the topic of using the Lord's name and vein

952
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
Who would have thought it on the Charlie

953
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,500
One thing I want to point out is this

954
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,500
In my original message to you Adam

955
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,500
I never mentioned using the Lord's name and vein

956
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,500
I didn't say that

957
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,500
That was you said that

958
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,500
And now a few others have used the phrase as well

959
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,500
When I brought the topic up to you Adam

960
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,500
About using Jesus name and conversation

961
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,500
I was coming from the perspective of maintaining respect for him

962
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,500
You know I believe that one of the reasons you brought the lawsuit

963
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,500
Against that gossip brag recently was because

964
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,500
Two of the people you love Patricia and Christina

965
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,500
Were brought into it

966
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,500
I know that in the end it became a dispute over creative comments

967
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,500
And that's a good thing you pursued that

968
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,500
But I remember you saying that you took that tack

969
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,500
Because the court would probably not give much weight to the family issue

970
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,500
But if you remember what really got you riled

971
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,500
Was protecting Christina

972
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,500
Now I'm not saying that Jesus needs my protection

973
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,500
Or anyone else's

974
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,500
All I'm trying to do here is draw parallel for you about

975
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,500
Carrying for your loved ones

976
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,500
Now if it's okay I'd like to address the issue

977
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,500
Of taking the Lord's name and vein

978
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,500
Far more serious than just saying Jesus Christ

979
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,500
When something goes wrong is this

980
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,500
As a Christian I've taken on Jesus name

981
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:53,500
I supposedly am one who said that I am a follower of Christ

982
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,500
I'm identified with him

983
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,500
Now if I have taken his name

984
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,500
And then live a life that is not in line with the way he teaches

985
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,500
Or if I live a hypocritical life

986
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,500
I have taken the Lord's name and vein

987
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,500
Even if I never swear

988
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,500
For me to take the Lord's name and vein in this manner

989
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,500
Is way more serious than using his name inappropriately

990
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,500
If I were to do that habitually

991
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,500
One might come to the conclusion that I don't really value who he is

992
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,500
Or my association with him

993
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,500
I think that's probably where the whole thing got started

994
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,500
About swearing by his name

995
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,500
It's not so much the name

996
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,500
It's the relationship I supposedly profess

997
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,500
So to sum up

998
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,500
Because I love Jesus

999
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,500
Hearing his name used inappropriately

1000
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,500
Is uncomfortable for me

1001
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,500
Like if someone were to say something bad about Patricia or Christina

1002
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,500
Well that would bother you

1003
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,500
The commandment about taking the Lord's name and vein

1004
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,500
Is really something that is aimed primarily

1005
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,500
At professed believers in God

1006
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,500
Hope this helps

1007
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,500
Remember Jesus said

1008
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,500
Whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst

1009
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,500
Indeed

1010
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,500
The water I give him will become in him a spring of water

1011
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,500
Welling up to eternal life

1012
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,500
You see it doesn't matter where you're at

1013
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,500
It doesn't matter what you've done

1014
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,500
It doesn't matter your age, your sex, your station and life

1015
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,500
Jesus said

1016
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,500
Who do you say that I am?

1017
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,500
Lifespring is about answering that question

1018
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,500
And the question of how and why the answer can

1019
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,500
And does affect your life today

1020
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,500

Now here's a real fast PS

1023
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,500
Adam I was watching the video you sent over the weekend

1024
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,500
With Trinity

1025
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,500
Think I've got some bad news for him

1026
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,500
It looks like that star in your windshield

1027
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,500
As most likely not repairable

1028
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,500
It looks way too big

1029
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,500
Why don't you take a picture of it and send it to me

1030
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,500
Maybe with a ruler in there

1031
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,500
So I can get it kind of an idea of the scale

1032
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,500
Anyway, thanks Adam

1033
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,500
Appreciate it

1034
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,500
And source code listeners

1035

1037
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,500
Steve, thank you

1038
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,500
That's the first time anyone actually

1039
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,500
Splane to to me

1040
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,500
So I appreciate that

1041
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,500
And know that I'm really trying

1042
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,500
And there's a lot of stuff that people

1043
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,500
Ask me to say or not to say

1044
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,500
And they feed that back to me

1045
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,500
I don't usually bring it out publicly

1046
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,500
Because they usually send me an email

1047
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,500
They don't send me an audio comment

1048
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,500
But I understand

1049
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,500
And so I slipped today

1050
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,500
I'm getting better

1051
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,500
I'm really going to try it

1052
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,500
I understand

1053
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,500
There's no reason

1054
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,500
I'm just going to replace it with something else

1055
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,500
Like

1056
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,500
If I hit my thumb, I'll be like

1057
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,500
Ah, profit my homet

1058
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,500
Hello Adam

1059
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,500
This is David from the Catholic Family podcast

1060
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,500
At CatholicFamilyPodcast.com

1061
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,500
I was listening to the Charlie

1062
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,500
Cha Cha

1063
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,500
Jimmy Chang'an

1064
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,500
And with 360 when I heard this

1065
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,500
Jesus

1066
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,500
The weed is like everyone's like

1067
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,500
Oh, that's really weird

1068
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,500
I just wanted to tell you that I am very proud of you

1069
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,500
Although you didn't quite catch yourself

1070
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,500
I consider this a step in the right direction

1071
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,500
Now I'm not going to let my kids

1072
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,500
Listen to you of course

1073
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,500
But maybe someday

1074
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,500
You see

1075
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,500
I have a dream

1076
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,500
That one day

1077
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,500
I will download the Jimmy Chang'an

1078
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,500
And a clean tag will appear next to the episode

1079
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,500
And iTunes

1080
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,500
Yes

1081
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,500
And on that day

1082
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,500
Catholic Family

1083
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,500
We'll listen to the Cha Cha together

1084
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,500
For the first time

1085
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,500
One in spirit

1086
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,500
With a big man

1087
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,500
Just wanted you to know that

1088
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,500
All right, buddy

1089
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,500
I'm sure many shows have been completely clean

1090
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,500
And could have had the explicit tag removed

1091
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,500
I just don't really remember

1092
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,500
To be quite honest

1093
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,500
But yeah, I'm trying

1094
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,500
I'm really working guys

1095
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,500
Hey back to what Steve website about

1096
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,500
About Trinity

1097
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,500
So the video, man

1098
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,500
I'm amazed how many different comments

1099
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,500
Of coming about the Trinity video

1100
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,500
And I think I have video figured out by the way

1101
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,500
I think I know now

1102
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,500
How I want to use it

1103
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,500
As a part of the Charlie Empire

1104
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,500
The Chumpire

1105
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,500
If you will

1106
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:47,500
But here's the stuff that amazed me

1107
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,500
An actual threat of conversation

1108
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,500
People saying

1109
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,500
Oh, you drive too fast

1110
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,500
And you're holding the camera

1111
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,500
And you're blackberry at the same time

1112
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,500
That's dangerous

1113
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,500
Like wow

1114
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,500
Look at the video again

1115
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,500
Please

1116
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,500
Oh, there's another one

1117
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,500
I can't believe you took the card

1118
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,500
For that little short distance

1119
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,500
First of all

1120
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,500
I walk all the time

1121
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,500
But this was a special occasion

1122
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,500
Because it was a video shoot

1123
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,500
For crying out loud

1124
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,500
I caught myself again

1125
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,500
And

1126
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,500
It was edited

1127
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,500
Okay

1128
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,500
You'll see there's all kinds of edits

1129
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,500
And G

1130
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,500
Do you think that there were some sound mixed in there

1131
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,500
From a Ferrari

1132
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,500
And do you think that maybe the video was sped up

1133
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,500
At certain points

1134
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,500
And maybe I was at the stoplight

1135
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,500
When I was filming the blackberry

1136
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,500
Please look for the edits

1137
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,500
This is how you get fooled

1138
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,500
Time and time again

1139
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,500
With television

1140
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,500
And it still carries over in the podcast

1141
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,500
One thing several people did point out

1142
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,500
Is I do seem to be leaking some fluid

1143
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,500
Or at least there's plenty of fluid on the floor

1144
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,500
There where a Trinity is birthed

1145
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,500
As in a birth

1146
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,500
Not coming to the world birth but a boat birth

1147
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,500
And here's the thing

1148
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,500
I'm not sure if it's from Trinity

1149
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,500
It's certainly because I noticed the spots myself

1150
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,500
It's like I drove Trinity into the garage for the first time

1151
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,500
Parked on the spot

1152
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,500
I've never been to that spot before

1153
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,500
And when I pulled her out

1154
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,500
That's when I saw the junk on the floor

1155
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,500
So it could have been there from the previous owner's automobile

1156
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,500
Or from just years of the garage being there

1157
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,500
I mean I don't know

1158
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,500
But it doesn't seem to have gotten worse

1159
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,500
And it seems to be dry

1160
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,500
But it is really black

1161
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,500
And I hope she ain't leaking

1162
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,500
But we're going to green my machine

1163
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,500
Very soon

1164
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,500
The Pimping of Trinity

1165
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,500
You've heard the jingle green my machine

1166
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,500
And that will be sponsored

1167
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,500
All under the slogan

1168
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,500
Save the world wind valuable prizes

1169
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,500
I have one last song I want to play for you

1170
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,500
Folks on the side light

1171
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,500
You're only going to catch just a little bit of it

1172
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,500
Because the window is now really closing

1173
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,500
And the PCH is coming up next

1174
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,500
I asked PW to keep it open for an extra half hour today

1175
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,500
So with the satellite folks could catch up as well

1176
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,500
Otherwise they only get half an hour

1177
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,500
We had such a catch up show to do

1178
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,500
To do whoops there's my Dutch Sorry

1179
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,500
This is pretty interesting this song

1180
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,500
Because it just showed up on the pod save music network

1181
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,500
And it's from a Dutch artist

1182
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,500
At least from what I can tell

1183
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,500
Wait a minute, first let me just wave goodbye to everybody

1184
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,500
Pete, go ahead man

1185
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,500
You can go ahead

1186
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,500
You can close it up

1187
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,500
Yeah, don't worry about it

1188
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,500
I'll be back with you folks tomorrow on this series stars 102

1189
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,500
So there's a record company

1190
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,500
I'm not going to tell you who

1191
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,500
Because I'm not quite sure what I can say or not

1192
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,500
There's a record company who is working with this artist

1193
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,500
I guess they paid for the recording of this artist

1194
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,500
And the mixing and they are planning on releasing it

1195
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:37,500
But now what they're doing is they won the releasing on the pod save music network first

1196
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,500
And they were already very excited about getting a couple of spins

1197
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,500
Then of course that's how it works

1198
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,500
So with your independent artist or record company

1199
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,500
It's still exciting to see you get in pod play

1200
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,500
And my feeling is that they're using it as a testing ground

1201
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,500
To see if it'll catch on or not

1202
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,500
And so I said, hey, I'll play it

1203
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,500
It's not one of my favorite songs

1204
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,500
But it's shoot just for the experimental loan

1205
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,500
It's worth playing

1206
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,500
And I shot back an email which I haven't heard back from you

1207
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,500
And I said, hey, when we open up commerce on the PMN

1208
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,500
Here's the big question

1209
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,500
Will you be selling it as well?

1210
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,500
Will you sell the track for 99 cents in DRM-3

1211
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,500
MP3

1212
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,500
Here's Adam and Minky

1213
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,500
A blind girl

1214
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,500
From the pod save music network

1215
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,500
I look beside me

1216
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,500
And I see you notice me

1217
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,500
I look at you

1218
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,500
And I see you smiling back at me

1219
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,500
You pull me closer

1220
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,500
We don't wait out to speak

1221
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,500
Yeah

1222
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,500
And for the first time

1223
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,500
I feel what you really need to me

1224
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,500
I'm a partner

1225
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,500
Walking

1226
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,500
I look at pictures

1227
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,500
And see the life you've been living

1228
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,500
Hey, I'm jealous

1229
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:03,500
You know I should've been a part of it

1230
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,500
Still I'm happy

1231
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,500
With the ways we can go in

1232
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,500
You show me feelings

1233
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:15,500
I'm never new you had before

1234
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,500
I want to find you

1235
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,500
I want to pay you

1236
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,500
Well

1237
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,500
I know you were engaged

1238
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,500
Me too

1239
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,500
Well

1240
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,500
I want to see you

1241
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,500
And I don't care

1242
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,500
So I can look at you

1243
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,500
Yeah

1244
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,500
You

1245
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:46,500
You wanna be, if I wanna be

1246
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,500
You

1247
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:51,500
You want to marry to me

1248
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,500
You

1249
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,500
He said in my bag

1250
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:01,500
He said in my bag

1251
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,500
I would SME

1252
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:08,500
And I'm on the way you are

1253
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:12,500
And just let me turn your back on me

1254
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:18,500
I'll feel the anger building up inside the day I'm right

1255
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:24,500
And for the first time I see what I really mean to you

1256
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:32,500
Oh my dear, you won't give me a chance

1257
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:38,500
Not knowing where it is made to go

1258
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,500
I want to sleep tonight, I don't dare

1259
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:46,500
It's why I'm here to ask you

1260
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:52,500
You're the best I want to be

1261
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:57,520
You are letting me

1262
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,500
I'll feel the anger building up inside the day I'm right

1263
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,500
You're the best I want to be

1264
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:10,500
You are livres I can't see if I'm ready

1265
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,500
You're the best I want to be

1266
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:20,500
I want to hear a long time

1267
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:24,500

1268
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:30,500

Please let me let it be

1271
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:56,500
I'm not the one

1272
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:04,500
You're the good one

1273
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:08,500
You're the good one

1274
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:14,500
You're the very same imagination

1275
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:20,500
Keep feeling my baby days

1276
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:24,500
And I love them day

1277
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:30,500
I want to be on a real way

1278
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:38,500
I need to be on me to be when you go

1279
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:48,500
You know what?

1280
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,500
