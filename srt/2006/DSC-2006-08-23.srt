Delta, Serator.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Four, four, seven.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Sometimes, animals all alone.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And he needs his love right there on the microphone.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So here she is, yes, the lady Patricia.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The stage who had some better than one.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And with this angel from above,

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
There's nothing that they both can't do.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
A make you wild as dreams come true.

17

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And let the fabulous show begin.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's Adam and Patricia.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, Adam and Patricia.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Adam and the lady Patricia.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The business is so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Lo, no, no, no, no, no, no.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The road of me, my dear.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I ask my own man, my guilty, call me.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I can't see it.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But nothing is how to do it.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's how you land so deep.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Get my make you sad.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is my world.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're my secret, but it's all I have to do.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm the way I'm supposed to do something.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Nothing is how to do it.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's all I have.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's all I have.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's all I have.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay, let's waste the space.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Well, never well-becase, you can make me grow up

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Cause I will waste my time

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Well, you're a semi-light

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But you can make me grow up

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I leave a loud chair in the nice coat drink

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh, well, never would I have a home to drink

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah, bitch, you're from ways I dreamt of you

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This moment's gone, but it was meant to me

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You might make it sad, but it's meant to me

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Hey, you're like a sad pocket, but you don't know

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah, bitch, you're from ways I dreamt of you

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm a semi-light, you're from ways I dreamt of you

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's all I want, it's all I want

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh, you're from ways I dreamt of you

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Well, never well-becase, you can make me grow up

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're a semi-light, you're from ways I dreamt of you

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Well, never well-becase, you're from ways I dreamt of you

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If I make you sad, but it's meant to me

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're just like my dad, what do you know

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You're the person that's never so mundane

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And nothing is how to do and it's how to help me

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You're the one, you're the one

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You're the one, you're from ways I dreamt of you

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Well, never well-becase, you can make me grow up

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You're the one, you're the one, you're from ways I dreamt of you

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You're a semi-light, you're from ways I dreamt of you

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You're from ways I dreamt of you

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, never well-becase, you're from ways I dreamt of you

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:30,440
The same state that spawned the award-winning Don and Drew from Wisconsin, Sunspot.

68
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,760
And some are day, which it is not today.

69
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,560
So much great music out there.

70
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
Isn't that cool?

71
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
Sure.

72
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Hey, you have a...

73
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
You have a hum.

74
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
You have a hum.

75
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
You have a hum.

76
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,560
You have a hum.

77
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Have a hum.

78
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Yeah, I can hear a hum.

79
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
Really?

80
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
Yeah, I don't worry about it.

81
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
That's okay.

82
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
This is the divorce course code.

83
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,560
Episode number, 447.

84
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
Sounds good.

85
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Keep in track, just in case you want to do that.

86
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
I came a favorite number.

87
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
447?

88
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
Well, 447.

89
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,560
So we had 444, not too long ago.

90
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,560
And someone said that's a really bad number.

91
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,560
It's a very unlucky number.

92
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,560
And I think in China, something like that.

93
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,560
Well, so...

94
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Well, I don't know.

95
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,560
It was a good day for me.

96
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,560
I'm trying to figure out what this is.

97
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,560
I don't hear it.

98
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
No, I hear it.

99
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,560
I hear something.

100
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,560
I hear a hum.

101
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,560
Could be the lights, the dimmer.

102
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
Yeah, yeah.

103
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
The house is falling apart, honey.

104
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
I popped one.

105
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
We have to move.

106
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
Yeah.

107
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
And we're getting closer.

108
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,560
We're learning so much about the United Kingdom.

109
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
In their houses.

110
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,560
It is never ending story.

111
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,560
I mean, we learn so much.

112
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,560
Is there a big limiter on you?

113
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
Hold on one second.

114
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
Yeah.

115
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
I got a big limiter on you.

116
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,560
Yeah.

117
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
Don't move.

118
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
Yeah.

119
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
I got a...

120
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
Okay.

121
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,560
There you go.

122
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,560
So you have to learn so much.

123
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,560
I mean, it's not easy to buy a house here.

124
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
Well, no.

125
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
It is not.

126
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
I found the big difference.

127
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
And for those of you living in the UK,

128
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,560
you may not know how it works in the rest of the civilized world.

129
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,560
And for those of you living in the civilized world,

130
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,560
you'd be amazed to hear how it works here.

131
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
No, I'm sorry.

132
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,560
This is a civilized country, but this is not a civilized process.

133
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
No, it's not.

134
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,560
In America, and in most countries, we have an intermediate step

135
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,560
when you buy a home called escrow.

136
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
Yeah.

137
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,560
And that means that you essentially have put down a percentage of the purchase price,

138
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
10 percent.

139
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,560
Yeah.

140
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
And you agree...

141
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
With that 10 percent, there's a contract that you agree with.

142
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
And you agree upon when you're going to pay the rest

143
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
and when they have to vacate the home.

144
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
And there's a whole bunch of other stuff.

145
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,560
No surveys and all that crap.

146
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,560
Okay.

147
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
There's the same.

148
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Yeah.

149
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
But here in the, you know, kingdom, they don't have that.

150
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,560
What happens is...

151
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,560
When you go to sign the paperwork, that's when it's done.

152
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,560
So you literally will see people moving out of their home,

153
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,560
or other people are moving in because people are often afraid to move out

154
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,560
because at the very last minute, it could all break down.

155
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Yeah.

156
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
So now that's one thing.

157
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
But of course, if you have what's called a chain,

158
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,560
because the person that you're buying a house from has to buy a house

159
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,560
from someone else, buying a house from someone else...

160
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
Have you ever heard of that?

161
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,560
No.

162
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,560
I haven't ever heard of this.

163
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
No.

164
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
Whatever.

165
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,560
But so what can actually happen and what's quite common is that five houses

166
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
will close.

167
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,560
We'll be sold on the same day, almost at the exact same time,

168
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,560
which could be all across the country.

169
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,560
And people that are moving in and it literally crossing each other.

170
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,560
You know, guy walking out of the couch.

171
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,560
So we're walking in with table.

172
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Yeah.

173
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
And it's crazy.

174
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,560
It's crazy because if the chain breaks.

175
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
Yeah.

176
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
Then you can be, and we're five people are fucked.

177
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,560
And we are, and we are always at the bottom of the chain

178
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
because we have nothing to sell on.

179
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
So we're just waiting.

180
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,560
And if someone above us is waiting on something,

181
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,560
then we're basically susceptible to that entire chain.

182
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,560
It's crazy.

183
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
It is so outrageous.

184
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,560
And real estate agents don't have to pass any kind of test here.

185
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,560
Anyone can become a real estate agent.

186
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,560
In fact, you would be a really good one.

187
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
Yes.

188
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,560
You would be a great real estate agent.

189
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
Yes.

190
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,560
Absolutely.

191
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,560
Absolutely.

192
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,560
So we're kind of...

193
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
I'm a good seller.

194
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
Yeah.

195
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,560
So we're kind of in the midst of all of that.

196
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
Understanding.

197
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,560
Because every time we're very happy to find something that we think could be, you know,

198
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,560
something that we would like to live in, that doesn't mean.

199
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
Oh, yeah.

200
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
That doesn't mean you can actually buy it.

201
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
No, I'm sorry.

202
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,560
Of course not.

203
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,560
Even if you dangle the money in front of their noses.

204
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,560
Well, that kind of depends.

205
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,560
If they are prepared to leave.

206
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,560
Yeah.

207
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,560
But then even when you agree upon a price and say, OK, so let's just say,

208
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,560
next week we'll, you know, we'll do the contract.

209
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,560
Someone else could come in if they did more.

210
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,560
That person has the legal right, not the ethical right, I guess.

211
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,560
But the legal right to just go settle to somebody else.

212
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,560
That is not very decent.

213
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,560
So by the same token, you know, that the real estate agents here will ask you,

214
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,560
do you need a mortgage, do you have a house to sell,

215
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,560
a lot of blah, blah, because they need to know what they're dealing with.

216
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,560
Because they could also be working for weeks on end or months with somebody.

217
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
Yeah.

218
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
At the very end, it might turn out that they don't have the money.

219
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
No.

220
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,560
Because you never had to put any money down.

221
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,560
There's no commitment.

222
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
It's so wrong.

223
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,560
It is.

224
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,560
So complicated and wrong.

225
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
Very wrong.

226
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,560
Who came up with that?

227
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,560
Well, and they can seem to get rid of it.

228
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
They've tried.

229
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
Yeah.

230
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
They're trying.

231
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,560
Yeah.

232
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
And then there's no tax rule.

233
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
Now I understand why they're shows about it.

234
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,560
Of course.

235
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,560
Of course, because you see you are destroyed.

236
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
Yeah.

237
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,560
They're emotional.

238
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,560
On the verge of a nervous breakdown.

239
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,560
Yeah.

240
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,560
Oh, man.

241
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,560
Yeah.

242
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,560
So honey, I know you haven't paid attention to the show for the last couple of days.

243
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Oh, don't say that.

244
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,560
It was the truth.

245
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,560
God.

246
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,560
But I've had it long come.

247
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,560
Well, you know I've been talking about did we land on the moon or did we not?

248
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,560
Yeah.

249
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,560
I heard the whole thing you explained it.

250
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,560
I've seen the footage.

251
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,560
Yeah.

252
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
You know.

253
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,560
So I got to say that we probably did land on the moon.

254
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,560
I'm pretty convinced.

255
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,560
Yeah.

256
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
Yeah.

257
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,560
You gave up?

258
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,560
Yeah.

259
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,560
I think I do give up.

260
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
Whatever.

261
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
However.

262
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,560
So this whole conversation was sparked because they lost the.

263
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
The tape.

264
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,560
That's a loss.

265
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,560
The original moon landing tape.

266
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,560
And still called tapes.

267
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,560
I don't have it on DVD.

268
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,560
No, of course not.

269
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:16,560
So John Aguilera, who is clearly part of the the Chacha Head gang, has found a copy of

270
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
the tape and attempted to us.

271
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,560
So we have, yes, we have the original copy of the tape.

272
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,560
Can you stick that thing in your ear?

273
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,560
It doesn't fit.

274
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,560
It's not at all distracted.

275
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,560
It's just it doesn't fit.

276
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,560
It doesn't stay in my ear.

277
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,560
It's no space.

278
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,560
I have the tiniest ears.

279
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
No.

280
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
Yeah, ears aren't that tiny.

281
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,560
It's the holes.

282
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
Yeah.

283
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
You got to go like.

284
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,560
Uh huh.

285
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Quite.

286
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,560
All right.

287
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
So while you fiddle with your ears.

288
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,560
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you.

289
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,560
Of course, this is audio only.

290
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,560
Yeah.

291
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
Let me just help you.

292
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
No, no.

293
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,560
It's okay.

294
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
One is in.

295
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,560
Yeah.

296
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,560
See, it's in.

297
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,560
You got to shove it in there.

298
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,560
Shubby and Mitch.

299
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,560
Permanent.

300
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
Yeah.

301
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
Yeah.

302
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,560
I present for you the original footage.

303
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,560
Audio only, of course, of the very first moon landing.

304
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Okay.

305
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,560
See, if I got this right.

306
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
I'm ready.

307
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
I'm ready.

308
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,560
You don't have light.

309
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,560
You can take a break.

310
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
You can.

311
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,560
Well, the fucking roof over.

312
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
Roger, may I call you?

313
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
We got these up.

314
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
We cannot believe.

315
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,560
You are on the fucking floor.

316
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,560
The police cannot fucking believe it, over.

317
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,560
You are a clear double gun lunatic, weapon's in there.

318
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,560
You want?

319
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,560
Fucking work on the floor.

320
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,560
Over.

321
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,560
By the way, clearing cock.

322
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,560
Are you fucking believing this over?

323
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,560
We.

324
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
We.

325
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,560
You.

326
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
Over.

327
00:12:44,560 --> 00:13:14,120
And you know that that's probably exactly what they were thinking actually yeah, I am walking on the fucking moon

328
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,640
You believe it? Yeah, yeah, of course

329
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,480
That's what the normal human being would say John Aguilera listener graphic designer Ford Collins Colorado

330
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,660
I'm indebted to you. It's just so funny. That was a great way to wrap that up. Yeah, yeah

331
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,160
But you really believe it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it makes sense

332
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,480
There's a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense, but you know now at this morning

333
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,480
I was watching the 911

334
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,240
Documentary you know that this guy put together a whole all the evidence

335
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,520
Yeah, and they've done a second version of it called 911 changes. So it's the it's the second version

336
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,880
Man, they do make such I mean, I don't want to get into the whole

337
00:13:51,200 --> 00:14:00,960
You know, it was 9-11 was it really terrorist or was it whatever did they know about it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

338
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,760
If you watch not the two French guys

339
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:09,560
There's a little piece of that is in there. This is really all exterior evidence and lots of quotes from everybody

340
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,760
You know, you'd have to go and and fact check every single thing, but

341
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,540
But isn't a great they have footage now of all those things that happen. I mean, you know

342
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,360
Well, the footage doesn't well, yeah, no, I don't know. There's a lot of second guessing people should know

343
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:29,480
Yeah, if it's really true then it's really frightening. Yeah, yeah, even more frightening than Osama bin Laden

344
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,280
Hey, I just heard on the news that a Northwest KLM plane from Amsterdam

345
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,280
Is returning back to Amsterdam to skip all airport because in several episodes

346
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
Yeah, on the BBC London

347
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,800
Because several passengers are in custody, so we'll find out what happened

348
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,520
Wow, yeah, what I'm gonna do a quick check on the new side because they were fighting or

349
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,120
Because sometimes when there's a fight aboard. Yeah, I'd probably have to go back. Let me see go

350
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,120
You know probably English

351
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,120
This

352
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,720
Patricia, what are you talking about? No, I mean no, thank no, the voice drink. No, it was from

353
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:18,080
People to I think the United States probably San Francisco. Okay, okay. Oh, I see. Let me see. There is

354
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,840
Oh, that's interesting. There's nothing on the number one new site. No, of course not

355
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
The Dutch and journalism, please

356
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,480
Well, could be could be drink could be

357
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,560
Well, what it probably is and I'm just guessing here. It's probably

358
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,960
You know what happened the other day with two Asian guys that you know people like oh, I don't trust you

359
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,000
Word about you. You don't look right and they tell you I just saw pictures in the in the paper of them

360
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,760
They're so cute who there's no handsome to two of them. I don't know what they were thinking

361
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:58,960
Which which guys are these the guys that they were they were they took them off the plane

362
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,280
Because people were

363
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:06,560
Right right that that was a Ryan air from afraid. Yeah, yeah, they felt that they oh, they were wearing

364
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
sweaters and I thought that that was

365
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,960
So this is really interesting. There is nothing at all

366
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,680
on I'm just looking at Google news which kind of goes through all the new. There's nothing at all on the Dutch Google news

367
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Nothing at all

368
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
but on the

369
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800

The spokesman for Skippel said the pilot had taken the decision to turn back but could give no further details

377
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,120
Security has been increased at airports blah blah blah blah blah blah

378
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,120
Dutch news agency AMP quote police is saying a number of people had been taken off the Northwest plane and were being questioned

379
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,120
Oh, so I guess it's already landed

380
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,120
Wow

381
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,120
Oh, I'm very curious about that

382
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,120
Yeah, that's interesting

383
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,080
Can that be I bet you I bet you it's just people are freaking out. That's what isn't a nice flying these days

384
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,440

I want to send them away

389
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,440
This the right the guy on the right looks like Richard Marx. Look at him

390
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,000
Look at him. It's Richard Marx. No look at the face look at the face look at the face

You're back. So I don't know what happened there people freak out for nothing

393
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,600
Excuse me what you got going on in your world baby. Well nothing

394
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,880
You know that we do miss big brother. I cannot believe I'm saying this

395
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,360
Because you know I hate big brother, but since I'm in the UK

396
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:30,560
Yeah, they're Britain in Britain. Yes, I followed it and it is so much nice is a big brother that we used to in Holland

397
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:37,680
Yeah, and and even the US big brother. I've once had nothing interesting, but this one is and we miss them

398
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,840
You know what it was not about they were part of our family. Yeah, right and how sad are we

399
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,560
Yeah, right well, it was very entertaining and now that I see them all in the paper

400
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
I have to say that

401
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,960
I'm so sorry for Ashley because she looks such she looks like a winner

402
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,960
Ashley and yeah, Ashley and you know the gorgeous

403
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:09,680
Yeah, well, you know wake up that the G strings and yeah, this was that you know who wakes up gorgeous

404
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,680
But this is a great way to do a dating show

405
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,280
You know why I mean for you to sit at home and think yeah, I would date her. I wouldn't date

406
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,960
Ashley and what a pain in the ass. I wouldn't date Nicky image

407
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,880
Yeah, but these people all locked up for weeks

408
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,560
Yeah, but that's when you see the true person

409
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,280
Yes, of course doesn't it drive you just mad

410
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,640
What do you mean become a different person just saying if I were at home, you know like evaluating who I'd want to marry

411
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:41,440
Yeah, but they say that they all changed because of it and they actually changed for the better

412
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,200
Yes, you know, yeah, they kind of came to you. What was kind of forgotten? We're so used to this big brother

413
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,120
But it started off the whole concept of the show was and it was called golden cage before became big brother

414
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,680
Was across between

415
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,680
What was the movie with Jim Carrey? Yes, um, yeah, that movie and biosphere

416
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,760
So it was supposed to be two in one the people actually weren't supposed to be able to leave the house at all

417
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,360
And of course you're not in the backyard or any of that so it was a very different concept of time

418
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,360
Yeah, it was a very different concept of time

419
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,400
So we've kind of forgotten the psychological aspect of what that does

420
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,000
Yeah, but I think it's it's

421
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,920
Every single person in there was positive these people here did a very good job. Yeah, they're a very strong

422
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:29,920
Actually, that was great product. They all been through a lot personally in but let's not make the end of the day the production

423
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,240
Company did a great job on choosing what to show. I think they do the great job

424
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,080
Building the stories because you know, they really build stories

425
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,520
Forget the games. It's the way they edit it. It's what they choose to show me

426
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,880
Fantastic very well done. Yeah, I really

427
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,120
Good story enters. I would add about it. You respect that but if I see the pictures from

428
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,640
Pete the winner. I've said for the American people don't know what we're talking about Pete and Nicky

429
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,520
I don't know if seen enough of those tongues hanging out

430
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,040
It's a little bit of a freak show

431
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:08,240
I don't know how long we can keep the guy who want one is a has a severe case of Tourette

432
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,920
Yeah, yes

433
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,240
What was very interesting in the beginning? Yeah, and what you see is that no one no one notices it anymore after a while

434
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,880
If I like to do this no one no one no one cared

435
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,640
Yeah, he's also his mom was the

436
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,120
Violin play miscellaneous in the common arts. So I met his mom. Yeah, not really consciously

437
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,040
No, I'm sure I shook her hand thinking of yeah, yeah, and his dad

438
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,080
He had he didn't he never met his dad and

439
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,960
Actually he knew he still didn't meet his dad because he he doesn't want it now. He's got a hundred thousand pounds

440
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,440
His dad will shoot now. Well, you bet but what I like about his dad is that he doesn't want a

441
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,600
How do you say to appear now because he doesn't want to have all the

442
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,240
publicity yeah, right so

443
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,840
That sounds he'll pop on the scene you watch. Yeah, yeah, I'm the son. It says

444
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:09,200
This is kind of you being Robin today and no, I thought I'd just play Robin and Howard. No, it said listen to this because

445
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,160
In my eye it was an eye catcher

446
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,920
Robbie Williams says Louis Wolves wants to manage me and sleep with me

447
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,920
He always thinks people want to sleep with him. I don't care

448
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,360
What do you see? I don't care. I really don't care about that doing Tom Cruise

449
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,440
Yeah, his production company broke up with Paramount. Yeah

450
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,520
That's a big deal yeah, yeah, and and so in no now

451
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,080
That really you know, that's his distribution partner. He would he would make the movies at this point

452
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,760
But I don't think that we're doing as expected at the box office

453
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,560
I mean getting a million people to do anything is still a big deal

454
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,480
But I think that people are kind of tired of it

455
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,040
I wanted to say that I think from now on I think it will go down a little bit

456
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,440
This is show business and

457
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,080
I'm a little bit sick of the whole thing yeah, but see I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that because

458
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,160
He is not the one out there about his Katie is Katie. It's the continuous press coverage

459
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,680
You know, I'm going to defend the guy now even though he's you know, I'm afraid of him

460
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,680
Yeah, but he started it

461
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,800
That's so unfair we've been in this exact same position where you're incredibly well-known

462
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,640
Something happens where the you started or not and the press just keeps repeating that over and over and over

463
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,320
I know but until people are sick and tired of it. Yeah, but this is so no

464
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,800
No, no, no, no, no, I'm gonna. He was jumping of the of the cow cheese and and you know, it was a bit

465
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:42,160
Ridiculous, so he did that once and that's been you know, that's been the you know, does that way against stretch

466
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,480
They've stretched you mean come on. He did some good shit. You know, you know, I was not an

467
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,800
I wasn't an admission impossible, but officer in a gentleman was was great top gun was great

468
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,800
Risky business was great. Yeah, that's what you think. I don't like it

469
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,280
Has nothing and I don't think he's cute

470
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,400
No, I don't think he's cute either, but you know, it's just I'm not gonna pile jump on the Tom Cruise

471
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,840
You watch everyone is gonna be all over of the guy is gonna you're right. He's gonna go totally on the downside of the rollercoaster

472
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,280
He'll come out okay on the other end. He'll probably do some more wacky things because that he doesn't know how to communicate in public

473
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,400
That's yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but could see it into this first place

474
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,040
And now it's just you know, and the whole Scientology thing. I think, you know, it's it's unclear

475
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,120
What is it? I don't you know, yeah

476
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,360
I don't know, but I'm not gonna I don't want to pile jump

477
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,720
I don't think it's not fair. No, I hate it when it happens to me

478
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
You know, I like to do that now and this

479
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,360

So we don't with crews

488
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,080
Yeah, I was done with crews. I wasn't I was already done with it. There's a study yesterday in the New York Times

489
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,280
It was a report about a study this guy is doing is writing a book called

490
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:27,840
Science of the mind I think and his research has shown that 40% of all adults from 17

491
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
Unup

492
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,880
40% of them

493
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,880
Would like to be famous

494
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,960
Really yeah now very small percentage of them think that that's really you know that that's not that's their ultimate goal

495
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,160
But when you think about it that what the position we're in now in in the world in in media

496
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,440
Fame yeah, is pretty much all you see yeah, you know

497
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:00,960
Whether it's being beyond say whether it's being yeah, yeah, whether it's being

498
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,360
You know the Arctic monkeys

499
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,880
You know whatever it is everything is about even my space you know

500
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,680
Yeah, which I could be the person who has 800,000 friends, you know, and not just in my

501
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,320
800 and stuff like that. Yeah, so there is kind of this fame culture

502
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,320
Yeah, which people all those shows are about it. Well, yeah, and looking you know

503
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,760
Roger you could become a there's the gen famous you can be famous and back in the day when when you when I work

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,920
They actually sell famous yeah, yeah, that's true. That's really what it is. Yeah. That's really what it fame, but you know

505
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,280
Being famous yeah, so

506
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:42,720
Let's just there's something going on with that there is definitely a change and I think that that's what brings upon this whole

507
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,840
You know when someone's famous do you think that

508
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,160
It brought a lot of happiness to people no or more sadness and

509
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,520
Unhappyness no in fact

510
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,520
Is that a word unhappyness unhappyness?

511
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,280
No, I think in the same in the same study the guy says that

512
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,400
It's like before people go into a meltdown they start talking about themselves a lot and using their own name a lot

513
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:14,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then you know and you have all these examples you know from Kurt Cobain to you name it

514
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
But a lot of it just ends in suicide

515
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:23,120
Well, I have self destruction one way or the other yeah, well of course being in the business for a long time

516
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,480
I'm seeing and met a lot of my colleagues and and very talented people

517
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,880
You have to be very strong

518
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,760
You have to be very strong to survive

519
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:43,360
You know that there are so many stars that went down because it is it is not easy

520
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,600
It is not easy because when you really really if if it's really your turn and your very famous

521
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,720
It's all about you every day is about you all the people around you talk about you

522
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
They laugh about your your jokes

523
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,800
Yeah, it's you know it's you you because everybody is of course

524
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
Even living an eating of you and

525
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,080
And in some people don't get that but if you smart you just you know keep on thinking about that

526
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:13,280
All these people are very hard. It's very hard. I don't think I could do that without you

527
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:19,760
I'd be lost so you won't I need jumping on couches and talking about Scientology. Yes, so do your world get smaller and smaller

528
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,880
What happened to Elvis personally, of course? They they kept it, you know really really small and

529
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,160
At the end something will happen to these people because this is not very healthy

530
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,800
It's not good and the people who who's a five

531
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:40,720
You know a very strong people right and they don't have the brain right and they're usually people that then

532
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,760
People start winding up not liking like Madonna

533
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:52,640
Yeah, no, so you know it is there's no-in situation which is why I feel what do you mean not liking how many people actually like Madonna?

534
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,080
I think a lot of people how many people have really started to dislike Madonna a

535
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:05,520
Lot a lot yeah, but do you think she's so strong? Yeah, I think that's why they don't like her

536
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:11,920
I think because you have to be strong people build up uh, you know, she had to change

537
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:17,200
She had to morph she's had to do all these different things to actually stay current with with her industry

538
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,720
Which is predominantly top 40 music and dance music. Yeah

539
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:27,840
So you change a lot people get pissed off. I think that Madonna sometimes is not nice because she's actually

540
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,360
frustrated

541
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:37,680
She knows she's not a great singer. She knows she gets a lot of shit for that and not accepted by a couple of people or a part of

542
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:44,160
Not fans, I don't know you know it's it's I think with her it's frustration

543
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:51,600
You know and I remember talking about famous when you got very famous in America

544
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,440
We were together thank God for that and you

545
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,880
Yeah, but that but that was amazing because we went you were already very well known in Holland

546
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,480
You went to America you were still young yeah with a mature woman next to you, of course, yeah

547
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,880
And suddenly in a couple of weeks time yeah, you were the hottest

548
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:20,080
Vijay on TV on MTV that's almost like having curable leprosy in a couple of weeks time

549
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:26,640
We couldn't walk the streets in New York. I mean screaming girls. I had to kick him. I mean you

550
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
I didn't get any of that asked you

551
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,040
Not a single fucking piece of tales. See there. Essas yeah

552
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840
Too shay

553
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:41,760
And you freaked out. I remember that you freaked out because you're not very good at that

554
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,000
You didn't know what to do. It came from you know all sides

555
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,360
Defined freak out, please so people don't think I'm some idiot, but I mean do I freak out well because you had to

556
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,400
You couldn't do anything you couldn't walk the streets you wouldn't what means I freaked out what what?

557
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:01,200
Because everybody wanted to piece of you. No, no, that's why, but what do you constitute a freak out?

558
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
Freaks out because you

559
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,640
You got very tired. No, no, no, I'm asking

560
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,320
What at what point what did I do that you said he's freaking out?

561
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:16,160
You got irritated. Oh, so I've been freaked out for 18 years baby. You became violent

562
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:23,520
You hid holes in the in the doors of the apartment. And listen, it's a sheet rock because you know

563
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,560
Yeah, of course, but you know why it was perfect. It was dramatic if things were so irritated

564
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:34,080
It was so heavy the load was so heavy everybody wanted a piece of you everybody wanted something

565
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,600
Everybody wanted interviews. Uh, I don't know what and when you were young and it happens in a couple of weeks of times

566
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,640
I've seen it and I had to pull your legs. Should I tell you something else? That was a

567
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,480
pool you don't. Should I tell you something else? There was also a lot of frustration there because

568
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,480
I was allowed to do absolutely nothing at MTV. Yeah, nothing. You know everything you said

569
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,000
We had to be sanctioned and pulled through the strainer very frustrating. So I wasn't able to just have fun and just

570
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:08,400
You know enjoy that was part one and MTV really hated their people becoming stars

571
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:15,040
They were completely against them. Perhaps for personal reasons, but I'll just take the high road and say that I believe it was

572
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,800
Probably not even not even stupid on their part. You know, it's like keep these kids interchangeable keep them

573
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,640
You know keep them fresh keep them young. Of course. I stayed there for eight years and they fired me

574
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,080
You know four times at least and they still kept coming back and

575
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,040
And want to meet a new one. And I wanted you to know that if it's not good, there's another waiting for you. Yeah

576
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,280
Yeah, and then that was the frustration

577
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:42,560
Because you are you have brains, you know, and you knew what was going on and it was it was not easy

578
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:47,760
I have to say it was not easy. I'll never forget the day we used to do music meetings

579
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:55,200
And the R&R talent was invited to the music meetings, which is basically what are we going to play on the channel this week

580
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,200
And and it was very political at all had to do with the record companies and you know if we did and it was coming to the video

581
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,280
Music Awards, so we had to play something from that artists label and all this stuff so that they're coming and then Gene Simmons

582
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,920
had a band what the hell was the name of that band he produced?

583
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,080
Okay, some I'll think of it and he came in with knee pads

584
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:23,520
Bards into the meeting jumped up on the table and said who do I have to blow to give to the

585
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:36,640
There's a strong person, that's an example of a very very strong person business that's business man

586
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,120
You know, well you also had an amenity for a long time which kind of helps

587
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:47,360
No one knew who the who the kiss guys were. Yeah, very good very good. I've been I've been waiting to play this thing

588
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,320
I don't I've been keeping it in the admin Patricia folder. I really don't remember why so let me just play it because

589
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,320
I've been keeping it for a reason, so let's just listen to this for a second.

590
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
Hey Adam, my name is John Hanover.

591
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
I live in Bang U Beach, Florida.

592
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,320
I listen to the Charlie first code, daily source code,

593
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,320
and watch out, et cetera.

594
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,320
Some bytune put it on the podcast.

595
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,320
We, you and me, usually go for a bike ride

596
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,320
to the beach on the ocean.

597
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,320
And it's sunshine, palm trees, ocean breeze.

598
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,320
Just the iPod and Adam and Dad.

599
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,320
And I can't believe it turned that bill in down.

600
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,320
Anyway, I'm a graphic designer, photographer.

601
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,320
I use the PC in a Mac.

602
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,320
This is, uh, he was calling in, telling him about himself.

603
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,320
This is one of our listeners.

604
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,320
But didn't we hear that already?

605
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,320
I can't believe you turned McDonald down?

606
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,320
I guess we did play that, didn't we?

607
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
Yeah, I'm sorry.

608
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
Okay.

609
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,320
I'm an idiot.

610
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,320
Uh-huh.

611
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,320
Now who's getting old here?

612
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,320
Uh-huh.

613
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,320
I'm going to be 342 in, uh, what, 10 days?

614
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,320
Yeah.

615
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,320
No, in two weeks.

616
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,320
Uh-huh.

617
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,320
I was feeling that yesterday.

618
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,320
You know, you know, I heard this.

619
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,320
You know, who Carmen Tyler is?

620
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,320
No.

621
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,320
You've heard her music before.

622
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,320
I've played it on the, on the, on the show.

623
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,320
She was, um, miss Louisiana in 1995.

624
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,320
I mean, stunningly beautiful.

625
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,320
Yeah.

626
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,320
Really heart-lain, beauty queen, 19 year old, 19 years old, once you won.

627
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,320
Yeah.

628
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,320
And she's on the podcast, Music Network.

629
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,320
Oh?

630
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,320
And, uh, really a lot of Christian gospel stuff.

631
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,320
Yes, that I played Amazing Grace, by the way.

632
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,320
Because I figured no one ever plays that song.

633
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,320
Yeah.

634
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,320
You never hear it on the radio.

635
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,320
Which, and she did it was a live version.

636
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
She definitely has, has some pies.

637
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,320
But I, you know, I keep saying, you know,

638
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,320
send me some naked pictures.

639
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,320
And she did it.

640
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,320
Well, no.

641
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,320
But, uh, I didn't get this comment.

642
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,320
Hey, Adam.

643
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
This is Aben from Reaching Farloos City.

644
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,320
And I just caught the last Charlie.

645
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
And I had to call you on this, man.

646
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,320
I'm looking out for your soul here.

647
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,320
You got me a little worried here.

648
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,320
And what I'm talking about is Carmen Tyler.

649
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:00,320
Now, the last couple of times you've played Carmen on your podcast.

650
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,320
You've asked her for naked pictures.

651
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,320
And normally this would not bother me one bit because,

652
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:10,320
a naked pictures and really hot chicks that goes a long way with me.

653
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,320
B.

654
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:16,320
I am in no way the person that needs to go around spouting any kind of values on anybody else with

655
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,320
my track record.

656
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,320
And see, you're a grown man or you can do whatever you want.

657
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,320
But I'm worried a little bit because we're talking about Carmen Tyler.

658
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,320
We're talking America's sweetheart.

659
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,320
We're talking about pageant queen.

660
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,320
We're talking about all around nice girl, man.

661
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,320
We are talking about America and Apple pie here.

662
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,320
And we're talking about a girl that has amazing grace on the

663
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,320
pot safe music network.

664
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,320
You just played it on your show.

665
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,320
We're talking about a lady that has just uploaded three new

666
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,320
Christian tracks to the pot safe music network.

667
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,320
Now, if there is a God and you're looking out for your soul,

668
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,320
even if you're just hedging bets here.

669
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,320
And I'm talking about hedging bets at him.

670
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,320
Think about it.

671
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,320
If you ask Jenna James and for naked pictures,

672
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,320
then you're got probably wouldn't mind at all because guess what?

673
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,320
She's kind of dirty like that and she's going to do it anyway.

674
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,320
But hit an up Carmen Tyler for naked pictures is sort of like

675
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,320
ask an Amy Grant to come over for a threesome or a circle jerk with a

676
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,320
pope or something like that.

677
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,320
It's the things that may just get on on God's bad side.

678
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,320
If you're hedging your bets, I mean, when you go,

679
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,320
God forbid, when you go and your soul is being judged,

680
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,320
do you really want the nagging of Carmen Tyler for nude

681
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,320
picks on that on your soul?

682
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,320
I mean, think about it like pot smoking at him.

683
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,320
He blaze up, enjoy it, and you're open about it.

684
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,320
And it's a really cool thing.

685
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,320
But you probably wouldn't do it if there was a judge or a police officer watching you.

686
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,320
And that's what I'm talking about here.

687
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,320
I'm talking about watching your butt by keeping all your bases covered.

688
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,320
So man, I'm just looking out for your brother.

689
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,320
I just had to put that out there.

690
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,320
Still love in the Charlie and I will talk to you later, man.

691
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,320
Bye.

692
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,320
And that's what America's come to.

693
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,320
Get a life.

694
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,320
That's what America's come to.

695
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,320
You can't even talk.

696
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,320
You can't even see naked pictures of people anymore.

697
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,320
Look at turn on the news.

698
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,320
There's lots of dead people on the news.

699
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,320
Let's watch dead people.

700
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
People in the Bible will all naked.

701
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,320
Thank you.

702
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,320
Except for a little leaf.

703
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,320
In my case of huge leaves.

704
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,320
But yeah.

705
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,320
Yeah.

706
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,320
Come on.

707
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,320
It's up with that.

708
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,320
You know humor.

709
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,320
Oh.

710
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,320
It's not even about humor.

711
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,320
I mean, now that's immoral for me to ask about that.

712
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,320
You know.

713
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,320
You don't mind, do you?

714
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,320
No.

715
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,320
Not at all.

716
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,320
I don't see anything wrong with that.

717
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
Can I send Carmen a naked picture of you?

718
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
Yes, sure.

719
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,320
Maybe she wants to join me.

720
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,320
You know?

721
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,320
No, no.

722
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,320
Yeah.

723
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,320
Now you're talking.

724
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,320
Patricia and Karen.

725
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,320
That didn't sound very attractive.

726
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,320
I liked it.

727
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,320
The guy.

728
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,320
Oh, that's eBay's cool.

729
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,320
He's cool.

730
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,320
I don't know if he's making a joke or not.

731
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,320
I don't know.

732
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,320
But it sounded a little bit pissed off.

733
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,320
He was pissed off.

734
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,320
All right.

735
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
What else do we have?

736
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,320
And yet you've reduced smoke and joined next to a police guy.

737
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,320
Yeah.

738
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,320
I have.

739
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,320
In fact in Belgium.

740
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,320
Here's one for you.

741
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,320
Let me tell you.

742
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,320
In Belgium, which is definitely not as liberal as it's northern neighbor.

743
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,320
When it comes to the holy herb.

744
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,320
You were driving the MG.

745
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,320
Remember that the company MG.

746
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,320
Yeah.

747
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,320
And you drove it right on that we're redoing a road.

748
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,320
And the sewage drains were high up in the air compared to the road.

749
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

750
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,320
Yeah, yeah.

751
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,320
And you drove it up right under the transmission.

752
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,320
And it's like.

753
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,320
And I was stuck.

754
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,320
He was stuck on the thing.

755
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,320
Yeah.

756
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,320
So you called me.

757
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,320
I showed up.

758
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,320
You know, joint dangling.

759
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,320
But the police was already there.

760
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,320
Next time.

761
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,320
Next to me.

762
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,320
So I get out.

763
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,320
And I'm smoking my dude.

764
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,320
But you did.

765
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,320
And I noticed.

766
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,320
And I said to you later.

767
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,320
Because why I was talking to the cop.

768
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,320
You know, explain to him what happened.

769
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,320
Oh, my.

770
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,320
You came high on.

771
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,320
You know, to pick me up and bring me up.

772
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,320
And you're standing there with a big joint.

773
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,320
And blowing the smoke into his face.

774
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,320
He didn't even notice.

775
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,320
This is my wife's pretty messed up.

776
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,320
Yeah.

777
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,320
And I said to you later.

778
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,320
Did you?

779
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,320
Did you notice?

780
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,320
Oh, I didn't.

781
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,320
I actually don't care.

782
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,320
So.

783
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,320
Oh, man.

784
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,320
All right.

785
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,320
All right.

786
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,320
Anything else we got?

787
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,320
Oh, the shadow falls is out.

788
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,320
The new episode.

789
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,320
You want to listen to it tonight?

790
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,320
Listen to that.

791
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,320
Right.

792
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,320
It's episode.

793
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,320
Don't give me that face.

794
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,320
We'll push it before a shit.

795
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,320
Do you want to listen or not?

796
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,320
Yeah.

797
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,320
What is it today?

798
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,320
Wednesday?

799
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,320
Yeah.

800
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,320
There you go.

801
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,320
That's it.

802
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,320
When instead of East Enders.

803
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,320
Yeah.

804
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,320
Listen to shadow falls.

805
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,320
Then we'll do it.

806
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,320
If you're in America.

807
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,320
Just listen to shadow falls.

808
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,320
You don't even turn on.

809
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,320
I'm so lonely.

810
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,320
Yeah.

811
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,320
Let's see.

812
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,320
We want to.

813
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,320
Oh, I promise that we might talk about Christina sleep over.

814
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,320
Oh, fine parenting moment.

815
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,320
Oh, OK.

816
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,320
Yeah.

817
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,320
So it was Saturday night.

818
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,320
Christina was going to go stay somewhere.

819
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,320
Oh, shit.

820
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,320
She doesn't know.

821
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,320
She didn't tell her.

822
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,320
No, no, no, no.

823
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,320
And she can do whatever she wants.

824
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,320
But just to check in and call us certain times.

825
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,320
Like before we go to bed.

826
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,320
Well, I have to explain that I had stories changing.

827
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,320
No, no, no, no.

828
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,320
I had very strict parents.

829
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,320
Very old fashion.

830
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,320
You know, it was another time.

831
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,320
I know.

832
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,320
I was born in 49.

833
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,320
So I was jumping out of the window when I was 15.

834
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,320
Exactly.

835
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,320
We had to.

836
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,320
Yeah.

837
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,320
Boy.

838
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:18,320
I would have loved to tell the truth to them and explain them.

839
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,320
You know, who I met and, you know, what I feel for the boy.

840
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,320
But I couldn't.

841
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,320
They were disgusted by it.

842
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,320
And they didn't want to hear it.

843
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,320
So that was horrible.

844
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,320
For teenagers, you feel very lonely.

845
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,320
You can go anywhere.

846
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,320
You're not allowed.

847
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,320
You have to sneak out.

848
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,320
You have to lie.

849
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,320
And I said to myself, I'm not going to do that with Christina.

850
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,320
You know, a teenage is a teenage.

851
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,320
She has to meet teenagers.

852
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,320
She has to do fun stuff.

853
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,320
Fun things.

854
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,320
Fun evil things.

855
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,320
Right.

856
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,320
Got to do some illegal stuff.

857
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,320
Christina said, I have a sleepover because it's somebody's birthday.

858
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,320
Mom, there's a lot of girls coming, blah, blah, blah.

859
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,320
And I said, okay.

860
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,320
Where is it?

861
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,320
Okay.

862
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,320
It's only because people go by train here a lot.

863
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,320
Yeah.

864
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,320
That's normal.

865
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,320
It's one stop.

866
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,320
Yeah.

867
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,320
Yeah.

868
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,320
We have little stations.

869
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,320
There's no problem here.

870
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,320
It's just like this.

871
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,320
Yeah.

872
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,320
It's just like this.

873
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,320
She went.

874
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,320
And the only thing I always say to her, you can do anything you want.

875
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,320
But keep in touch with mommy.

876
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,320
So you have to call me.

877
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,320
So in the middle of the evening somewhere.

878
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,320
It's just, oh, I have to call mommy.

879
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,320
Of course.

880
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,320
It's great with self.

881
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,320
Just so no, she's fine.

882
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,320
That's different from when we were kids.

883
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,320
Yeah.

884
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
Because we were worried.

885
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,320
You know, normally moms would be worried.

886
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,320
Because you don't know what's going on.

887
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,320
There was no phone.

888
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,320
Yeah.

889
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,320
They always said, there was no phone in the neighborhood.

890
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,320
Well, now you got your phone.

891
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,320
So you can call me.

892
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,320
Just the only thing I want to know.

893
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,320
And before you go to bed.

894
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,320
So I know.

895
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,320
I don't tighten up the story, huh?

896
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,320
All right.

897
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:51,320
But that's, you know, parents recognize that.

898
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,320
Yeah.

899
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,320
Absolutely.

900
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,320
So it's Saturday and we're sitting and watching TV.

901
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,320
We had some sex planned.

902
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,320
Yeah.

903
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,320
But you were worried.

904
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,320
Well, she was supposed to call around midnight.

905
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,320
She didn't call.

906
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,320
And then of course, when we called her.

907
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,320
Then call the whole evening.

908
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,320
When we call her, we get voicemail.

909
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,320
Yeah.

910
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,320
Yeah.

911
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,320
We sent text messages.

912
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,320
We get nothing back.

913
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,320
Yeah.

914
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,320
We got to go to bed.

915
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,320
Yeah.

916
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,320
So my evening is destroyed.

917
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,320
Yeah.

918
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,320
Exactly.

919
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,320
I couldn't go to bed.

920
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,320
I'm like, I want to know.

921
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,320
I got to hear from her.

922
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,320
Yeah.

923
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,320
The young beautiful girl.

924
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,320
I have to know what she's doing.

925
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,320
So around 1230 or so, we finally.

926
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,320
No.

927
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,320
You got to hold her.

928
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,320
Yeah.

929
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,320
I got to hold her.

930
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,320
I hear a lot of noise and laughing.

931
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,320
And I hear guys.

932
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,320
Yeah.

933
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,320
Of course.

934
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,320
Of course.

935
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,320
What did you expect?

936
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,320
Yeah.

937
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,320
So I said.

938
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,320
Are they going to sleep?

939
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,320
Yeah.

940
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,320
They're going to sleep over to us.

941
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,320
Guy sleeping over.

942
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,320
Mom.

943
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,320
They're ugly.

944
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,320
You know.

945
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,320
That's just friends.

946
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,320
That's a good one.

947
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,320
Don't worry about it.

948
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,320
They're just friends.

949
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,320
Because these days, they have boys and girlfriends.

950
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,320
That's back.

951
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,320
So I'm like, it's not like in our days.

952
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,320
If you had a boy, it was always something going on.

953
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,320
Sexual attention.

954
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,320
These days.

955
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,320
No.

956
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,320
Anyway.

957
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,320
So.

958
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,320
But then she threw a whole bunch of attitude.

959
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,320
Yeah.

960
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,320
It was, you know.

961
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,320
Really unpleasant.

962
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,320
Yeah.

963
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,320
And so then I'm.

964
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,320
You're stalking me.

965
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,320
So then I'm that now I'm getting worried.

966
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,320
I'm like, I want to know what's going on.

967
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,320
So this is one o'clock.

968
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,320
Yeah.

969
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,320
And I said until now, she always tells the truth.

970
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,320
And he said, you said to me, well, this time I'm going.

971
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,320
I'm going to check.

972
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,320
Yeah.

973
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,320
So I jumped in the car.

974
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,320
Talking.

975
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,320
Yeah.

976
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,320
I drove like 25 minutes to the place.

977
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,320
And you know, and they were all sitting on the porch.

978
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,320
I think I'm completely nothing quite neighborhood.

979
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,320
You know.

980
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,320
And I'm hiding behind a tree.

981
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,320
Right.

982
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,320
Looking.

983
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,320
And you know.

984
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,320
I can't believe it.

985
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,320
And then I like stick my head around the corner.

986
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,320
And then there's.

987
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,320
No, the big automatic light goes on like.

988
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,320
And then I'm like, what the fuck am I doing?

989
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,320
Yeah.

990
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,320
Whatever.

991
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,320
Oh, poor girl.

992
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,320
I was worried though.

993
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,320
I'm worried.

994
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,320
So.

995
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,320
And I have to be calm.

996
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,320
Well, sometimes you need to know.

997
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,320
Yeah.

998
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,320
And by the time I got back, we were both too tired.

999
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,320
Yeah.

1000
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,320
Yeah.

1001
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,320
Actually, the whole evening was ruined.

1002
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,320
Kind of.

1003
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,320
Yeah.

1004
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,320
The vibe was kind of out.

1005
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,320
Please don't tell Christina.

1006
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,320
No.

1007
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,320
Nobody.

1008
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,320
Gee.

1009
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,320
Shh.

1010
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,320
Don't.

1011
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,320
I was ashamed.

1012
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,320
I'm not ashamed.

1013
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,320
No.

1014
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,320
You could daddy.

1015
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,320
This is what I said when you came home.

1016
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,320
I said you're good daddy.

1017
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,320
It would have been bad if I'd like stormed up there and said,

1018
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,320
where my daughter.

1019
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,320
Yeah.

1020
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,320
Who's touching my daughter?

1021
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,320
Oh, nobody.

1022
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,320
All right.

1023
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,320
Let's get out of here.

1024
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,320
Yeah.

1025
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,320
We got stuff to do.

1026
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,320
You guys are going shopping.

1027
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,320
I've got to do the BG blast with Christina.

1028
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,320
We're recording that today.

1029
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,320
Yeah.

1030
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,320
I want to finish my video show.

1031
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,320
So maybe you'll do that way.

1032
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,320
You guys are out.

1033
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,320
Well, I'm going to go out together because she wants some

1034
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,320
clothes I think.

1035
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,320
And for her party.

1036
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,320
Which is not the week Sunday.

1037
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,320
It's her birthday.

1038
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,320
She has a big party.

1039
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,320
Man, that's going to be a pain.

1040
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,320
Yeah.

1041
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,320
You know, this is going to be like 50 kids.

1042
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,320
They're all going to be sneak and drink in.

1043
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,320
I'm going to have to be sure.

1044
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,320
Like a fucking police.

1045
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,320
I'm not giving them the alcohol.

1046
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,320
No, of course not.

1047
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,320
But again, think back.

1048
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,320
Yeah.

1049
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,320
No.

1050
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,320
I never drank.

1051
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,320
I mean, either.

1052
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,320
I mean, a beer too.

1053
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,320
No.

1054
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,320
No.

1055
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,320
But, you know, how about your peers?

1056
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,320
They drank.

1057
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,320
They did stuff.

1058
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,320
No, in my days.

1059
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,320
No.

1060
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,320
It was not like, no, it was not like that.

1061
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,320
I think the smoking was a big thing.

1062
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,320
Do you have a cigarette?

1063
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,320
I remember that, too.

1064
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,320
Yeah.

1065
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,320
Sneak and smoke.

1066
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,320
Yeah.

1067
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,320
Yeah.

1068
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,320
Okay.

1069
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,320
Well, this was a good catch-up with you.

1070
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,320
Yeah.

1071
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,320
Would you drop by the house more often?

1072
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,320
You're kind of fun.

1073
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,320
Let me, yeah.

1074
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,320
Let me play a song.

1075
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,320
New lyrics, though.

1076
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,320
Please feel free to sing.

1077
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,320
We were so happy until my PC died.

1078
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,320
Got disconnected.

1079
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,320
I just sat down and cried.

1080
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,320
To search for you.

1081
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,320
Believe me, I tried.

1082
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,320
I wanted you to be my digital bride.

1083
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,320
I loved you.

1084
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,320
I loved you.

1085
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,320

00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,320
I loved you.

1111
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,320
I loved you.

1112
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,320
I loved you.

1113
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:48,320

I loved you.

1121
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:05,320
I was true, I'm not a lifesaver, I weigh 202

1122
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:09,320
I like sleeping with animals and calling for sex lines too

1123
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:13,320
I was gonna tell you when I got to meet you

1124
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:21,320
You took girl, you took girl, you took girl

1125
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:26,320
You took girl, you took girl, you took girl

1126
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:39,320
I love you so, I love you so, yeah

1127
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,320
It's kind of like, I heard I liked it

1128
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,320
I was all right

1129
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,320
It's the Gorski's, they're from Australia

1130
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,320
They have a whole bunch of stuff on the bottom of the music network

1131
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,320
Would you go to Australia with me please?

1132
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,320
No, why not?

1133
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,320
I don't feel like it

1134
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,320
One day, you may be haunted

1135
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,320
You're almost there

1136
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,320
You should

1137
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,320
I got a lot of friends there

1138
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,320
We can stay all over the place

1139
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,320
Yeah, absolutely

1140
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,320
I know you only go for the five star hotel

1141
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,320
We have invites, we can meet you

1142
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,320
I'm afraid, we're like it

1143
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,320
One hour?

1144
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,320
It sounds good

1145
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,320
It's beautiful

1146
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,320
It really is

1147
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,320
We should go

1148
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,320
It's a sort of American England

1149
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,320
It's a complete mix between

1150
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,320
It has the British Properness

1151
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,320
It has the Dutch Fuzzella Hight

1152
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,320
Cozyness

1153
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,320
And it has the American Commercialism

1154
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,320
Is that a country from me or what?

1155
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,320
Yeah, it sounds very attractive

1156
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,320
And the shaders are really hot-looking

1157
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,320
Okay

1158
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,320
Yeah

1159
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,320
Oh look at that

1160
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,320
Nice guys, I heard

Very nice looking guy

1162
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,320
Very good surfer boy

1163
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,320
Oh

1164
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,320
Please, I'll stand back for the enthusiasm

1165
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,320
Yes

1166
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,320
All right

1167
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,320
Okay

1168
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,320
Now we're done

1169
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,320
All right

1170
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,320
Thank you, hon

1171
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,320
Are you welcome?

1172
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,320
I was loving when you come on the show

00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,320
What?

I love when you come any time

1175
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,320
But when you come on the show, it's the best

1176
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,320
God

1177
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,320
Oh

1178
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,320
You will get comments

1179
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,320
Yeah, no, God is going to punish me

1180
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,320
Yes

1181
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,320
For impure thoughts

1182
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,320
Yeah

1183
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,320
All right

1184
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,320
Do you get dinner?
