Delta Sierra Charlie 4-1-1.

00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,280
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,280
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:33,280
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,280
Fantastic, it's Adam Curry!

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:51,280
I know everything's all just a little bit crazy.

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:58,280
Days gone by month and year I'm fine.

11
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:05,280
Your friends let's say you should blame me.

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,280
I think that I'm wrong, I know they're right.

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,280
I said it home, we didn't fall in for you for me.

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,280
I know you'll think I'll be heaven fun.

15
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,280
Let me tell you that my life is boring.

16
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,280
And I miss the times we had when we were young.

17
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:43,280
I'm sorry for the way I left you standing there.

18
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,280
I know I made you look just like a...

19
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,280
I know it's hard to make up.

20
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,280
I know it's hard to wake up.

21
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,280
All I want is you that you're my yours.

22
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,280
I know all you need is a little time.

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:15,280
Someone just bring me next year.

24
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,280
I hope you know that I'll read in minutes.

25
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,280
I will fly around the world to make you see.

26
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,280
I'm sorry for the way I left you standing there.

27
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,280
I know I made you look just like a...

28
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,280
I know it's hard to make up.

29
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,280
I know it's hard to wake up.

30
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,280
All I want is you that you're my yours.

31
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:25,280
I'm sorry for the way I left you standing there.

32
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,280
I know I made you look just like a...

33
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,280
I know it's hard to make up.

34
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,280
I know it's hard to wake up.

35
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,280
All I want is you that you're my yours.

36
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,280
I'm sorry for the way I left you standing there.

37
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:57,280
I know I made you look just like a...

38
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,280
I know it's hard to make up.

39
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,280
I know it's hard to wake up.

40
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,280
All I want is you that you're my yours.

41
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,280
All I want is you that you're my yours.

42
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,280
All I want is you that you're my yours.

43
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,280
That's too bad you didn't listen to the whole song because I was playing it for you.

44
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,280
Back in my arms.

45
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,280
Yes.

46
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Hey just sitting there like looking into space.

47
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,280
No, I was listening.

48
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
How?

49
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
I didn't know it was three.

50
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,280
Hey everybody, how you doing?

51
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,280
I welcome to the loud enough...

52
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,280
If you don't have it, I know.

53
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,280
Come to the daily source code.

54
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,280
It's Monday coming to you once again from the cottage.

55
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,280
We're back.

56
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,280
A rive yesterday morning from San Francisco.

57
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,280
And I'm back with my lovely girls.

58
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
And you feel like shit.

59
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,280
I feel like total crap.

60
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,280
I really do.

61
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
But I didn't sleep yesterday.

62
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,280
Didn't have my regular nap except for after the...

63
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,280
After the Holland versus Portugal game.

64
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,280
I think I was drooling for an hour or so.

65
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,280
Wasn't I drooling on the couch?

66
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,280
Totally dead.

67
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,280
But can you imagine how your body is feeling?

68
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,280
The body doesn't know where it is?

69
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
Oh, my body is saying...

70
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,280
Day or night?

71
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,280
My body is saying...

72
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
You're almost 42.

73
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
Are you out of your mind?

74
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
What are you doing?

75
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,280
What are you doing?

76
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
But don't you think you could use to that?

77
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,280
Yeah.

78
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,280
If that's a body you could use to doing these things.

79
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
Yeah, oh yeah.

80
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,280
I think so.

81
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
Oh yeah.

82
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,280
You were even more used to it last time.

83
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,280
Which of course is my problem because...

84
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,280
I do very well.

85
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,280
You are fantastic.

86
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,280
But I have to say you're losing weight.

87
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
Yeah, no shit.

88
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
No shit.

89
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,280
No shit.

90
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
What do you expect?

91
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
Do you think I lost?

92
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,280
Do you think I lost?

93
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
Are you feeding you there?

94
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
No.

95
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
I've got no girlfriends in the corner.

96
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,280
You have to be careful.

97
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,280
People are going to bring food to you.

98
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,280
There's one rule I had at MTV.

99
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,280
It's like, once if someone leaves food from me, it'd throw it out.

100
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,280
Yeah.

101
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,280
Not going to eat food that someone prepared that I don't know.

102
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,280
Yeah.

103
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,280
That's very dangerous.

104
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
People send brownies and cookies.

105
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,280
I'm sure it was all the best attention.

106
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
Yeah, you never know.

107
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
Hey, just wanted to say something about that song.

108
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
The one I played for you that you weren't listening to.

109
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
Yeah.

110
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
It's not true.

111
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
I was listening.

112
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,280
The band is called Tate in My Arms.

113
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
This is from South Africa.

114
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,280
Really?

115
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
This band.

116
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
Yeah, this is Glenn from the Zed A show.

117
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,280
To Americans that would be the Zed A show.

118
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,280
We say Zed A.

119
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
He sent in this email.

120
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,280
It was like, he got, it was it.

121
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,280
A huge independent label in Cape Town called Fresh Music.

122
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
He got him to upload over 30 tracks.

123
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
The podcast music network.

124
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
This is just one of them.

125
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
It's cool, isn't it?

126
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Very cool.

127
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,280
No idea what the pop scene was like.

128
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
No.

129
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,280
No.

130
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,280
It's South Africa.

131
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,280
And apparently a live and well and vibrant.

132
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,280
And you know what?

133
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,280
I always meet people from South Africa, especially in England.

134
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
Especially in England.

135
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,280
And we can always speak with them because they speak South Africa.

136
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,280
Which is very similar to South Africa.

137
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,280
Do you speak South Africa?

138
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,280
And they say, yeah.

139
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,280
So yesterday we went to look at this house that Patricia found while I was gone.

140
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,280
Which is without a doubt a spectacular home.

141
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,280
Yes.

142
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Spectacular.

143
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,280
And the guys also from South Africa.

144
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,280
Beautiful views.

145
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,280
Amazing views.

146
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,280
Yeah.

147
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
I got to go count the pennies, baby.

148
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
Yeah.

149
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
See if we can afford it.

150
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,280
It's beautiful.

151
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
Yeah.

152
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
It's expensive here.

153
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,280
But this is really, it's the Beverly Hills of the,

154
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,280
Yeah.

155
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
Or maybe it's at the Hollywood Hills.

156
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,280
The Hollywood Hills of Gilford.

157
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
I found it.

158
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
It's beautiful.

159
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
Finally found it.

160
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
You look all the way down.

161
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,280
And you can see how Gilford lay in there.

162
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Yeah.

163
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
And it's beautiful.

164
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,280
There's no place to land a helicopter I noticed.

165
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
No.

166
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
No.

167
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,280
No.

168
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,280
I wouldn't.

169
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,280
No.

170
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,280
It's a pity.

171
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
It's just a minor pity.

172
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
But man, was that a great house?

173
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
Yes.

174
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,280
It's a holy crap.

175
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,280
No.

176
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
And you know what you liked?

177
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,280
Yeah.

178
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,280
Because it looks a bit like a man's thing in there.

179
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
Totally.

180
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,280
This guy got it together, man.

181
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,280
He designed this thing, right?

182
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
Yeah.

183
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
Because he likes it.

184
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,280
Everything goes switch off switch on.

185
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,280
You can all do it by a remote.

186
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,280
Wireless sound throughout the entire house.

187
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
Plasma screens building.

188
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,280
That's why you had to see it because yeah, this is what you want.

189
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,280
And normally you have to, you know, you have to put that in, which never happens.

190
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
No.

191
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,280
Because I don't even have music in my living room downstairs.

192
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,280
Nothing.

193
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,280
Or did you request it?

194
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:20,280
Oh, don't you think that is, you know, the most normal thing you were you to have?

195
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,280
No.

196
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
No.

197
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,280
Well, I miss it.

198
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
When we're in the living room, we only want to television or entertain guests.

199
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,280
No.

200
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
No.

201
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,280
You know, all the, also the reception room and family room.

202
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
For your clients?

203
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
For your clients?

204
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
For your clients?

205
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,280
I didn't.

206
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,280
And do my, you know, my reading and, and it's nice because now.

207
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,280
Okay.

208
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,280
I got the message.

209
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Yeah.

210
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
When I got the message.

211
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Just, I just played the four seasons downstairs because, you know, it was raining a little bit.

212
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Your, you know, you could be a disco jockey because I'm in the bathroom and I hear Patricia go.

213
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,280
Oh, I think I should play some four seasons.

214
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
It's evolved.

215
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
It's evolved.

216
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Yeah.

217
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
Yeah.

218
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,280
I haven't played them for a long time because, you know, it's not really classic.

219
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,280
They call it actually popular.

220
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,280
I think it's classic and not for me.

221
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,280
So, and I saw the, you know, it was dark and a little bit, a little bit hazy.

222
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,280
And I thought, yeah.

223
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280
Yeah.

224
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
Yeah.

225
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
Yeah.

226
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
And I thought, oh, it's a pity.

227
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,280
Can't play it in living room.

228
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,280
Okay.

229
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
Well, I'll make sure you can.

230
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Can't play house.

231
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
Yeah.

232
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
That's the problem is that we're renting the cottage.

233
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
Yeah.

234
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
We cannot open the walls.

235
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,280
We've been here for a year and a half and I have to say we're pretty sick of the place.

236
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,280
I mean, it's a great house and it's got, it's the location you almost can't be.

237
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
It doesn't function.

238
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:35,280
Well, you can't do anything because and everything we do to the house would be for the, for the, for

239
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,280
Cox, for Kevin Cox, for the owner.

240
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,280
Well, I like him a lot, but I'm not going to.

241
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Sweet.

242
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
Yeah.

243
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
I'm not going to fix his house.

244
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,280
No, because things you need and you want to do, you know, you can do that.

245
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
No.

246
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
No.

247
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,280
So, I missed you.

248
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,280
I missed you too.

249
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,280
I don't know.

250
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,280
But this time, I really, really miss.

251
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,280
You know, why is because I've been, we've been together for two months.

252
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
That maybe that was it.

253
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
We were in Portugal.

254
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
I was here.

255
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
What were getting the pleasure.

256
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
You came off us going.

257
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Then we went to California together.

258
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
We came back.

259
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,280
Yeah.

260
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,280
And then I kind of like, and also because I left a day earlier than planned.

261
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,280
I kind of like did a, we came back.

262
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,280
You and I and we did a 360 and I went right back.

263
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,280
Yeah.

264
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Almost a week later.

265
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,280
Right.

266
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,280
That's why I'm tired.

267
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Yeah.

268
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
I'm wrecked.

269
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,280
That was pretty tough.

270
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
Yeah.

271
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,280
You know, being with Christina all the time.

272
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280
Yeah.

273
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
So for teenage level.

274
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,280
So this is interesting Friday.

275
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,280
Friday morning.

276
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:36,280
I was at the Department of Motor Vehicles, which is a fantastically fun place to be in San Francisco.

277
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,280
I had to get Trinity registered.

278
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,280
And I have to get a California driver's license on that crap.

279
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,280
And there's only one department of motor vehicles and all of San Francisco.

280
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,280
Only one.

281
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,280
And it's, it's always fun.

282
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,280
Very fun.

283
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,280
And so just as I'm at the counter.

284
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,280
You know, getting ready to go through all this paperwork.

285
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,280
I look at my blackberry and there's a message from you.

286
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,280
And you tell me that Christina had an accident in a school.

287
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,280
And I want my, my, my gut just went, oh my God.

288
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
Yeah.

289
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
You want to tell the story?

290
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,280
Well, I got the same call from school.

291
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
Here's the call.

292
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,280
You never want to receive.

293
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
No, never.

294
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
Never.

295
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,280
So it was sports day.

296
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,280
And a couple of schools in Guildford had sort of a sports day.

297
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
Field day as we call it.

298
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,280
No, yeah, it's a sports day.

299
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,280
But in Yemen and states, I say, field day.

300
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,280
And Christina said, in the morning, I'm not feeling well.

301
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,280
My neck is a little bit stiff.

302
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,280
I don't think I go.

303
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,280
And I thought, well, it's pity because you know, the teenager.

304
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
And she's good at it.

305
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,280
And she's good at running to move a little bit.

306
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Because they're already a little bit lazy.

307
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
A little bit.

308
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
And yeah.

309
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,280
And she got MSN, but my space asks.

310
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,280
And they do snack a lot.

311
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
You know, so that should, you know, of course.

312
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
You snack.

313
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,280
You have to also move physical education.

314
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,280
Very important.

315
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,280
That's right.

316
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,280
So I said, you know, she was going.

317
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
And she didn't want to.

318
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,280
Then we got a call at nine thirty from her girlfriends from school.

319
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,280
And we heard all giggling in the old outside and everything.

320
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,280
And it was nice weather.

321
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,280
So there's the orchestra in the police.

322
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
Come, please.

323
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,280
If we need you, because you're such a great runner.

324
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
Was it against another school or just different classes?

325
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
I don't know.

326
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,280
I think so.

327
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
It was something going up.

328
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,280
And she said, Mama, should I go at you?

329
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,280
Okay, you're such a great runner.

330
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
You should go.

331
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
You know, it's good.

332
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,280
It's nice weather.

333
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,280
And if you don't want to just be there.

334
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
And so she went.

335
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,280
So I felt so guilty afterwards.

336
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
You forced it to go and look what happened.

337
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,280
Okay.

338
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,280
So you got a phone call.

339
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
So I got a phone call.

340
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
And they said, Christine had an accident.

341
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
And she's already.

342
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
The ambulance is coming.

343
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
And I hear ambulance.

344
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
And my God.

345
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
It's like your heart.

346
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,280
You want to like you want to puke immediately.

347
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
Yeah.

348
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,280
So I said, where is she?

349
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,280
And they told me the guilt for the royal guilt for the hospital.

350
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,280
No clue where it is, of course.

351
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,280
Where is it actually?

352
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Is it the one near school?

353
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
I don't even know where I went there.

354
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Well, how did you get there?

355
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,280
I called the taxi.

356
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280
I called the cab.

357
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280
And I drove behind him.

358
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Oh, okay.

359
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
You had a.

360
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,280
Because I don't know how long it takes.

361
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
So sorry.

362
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
And you still don't know where it is.

363
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
You just followed him.

364
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
I followed him.

365
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Okay.

366
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
But I found my way back.

367
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,280
Good girl.

368
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,280
When I came down, I was actually earlier than ambulance.

369
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
And I had to give.

370
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
And it's so funny.

371
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,280
Because you have to give your name.

372
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,280
You have to give.

373
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,280
You know, Christina was born.

374
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
I didn't know anything anymore.

375
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,280
I said, I'm so, I'm Dutch.

376
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,280
Oh.

377
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,280
No, not just.

378
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
My brain is moist.

379
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
No, I'm Dutch.

380
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,280
I'm so, I'm Dutch.

381
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
And I'm so nervous.

382
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
Yeah.

383
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,280
So I'm very nervous.

384
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,280
I didn't know anymore.

385
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,280
I didn't know my address.

386
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
But then.

387
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,280
Did you have your teeth in?

388
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
Yes.

389
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,280
Well, you know, no, there was nothing to smile about.

390
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
No, no, no, no.

391
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,280
Um.

392
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
But I could just imagine.

393
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
I gave it.

394
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
I don't know who I am.

395
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
There's one with no teeth.

396
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
Remember when I was pregnant?

397
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
That's the same thing.

398
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,280
I didn't know, you know, lots of things that I didn't know anymore.

399
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,280
No.

400
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,280
Which is normal for pregnant women.

401
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,280
I think I, I think I didn't remember either.

402
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
I think I was.

403
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
When you were pregnant, I was in mush too.

404
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
All right.

405
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
So come on.

406
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
People want to hear the story now.

407
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
Yeah.

408
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,280
So she came in.

409
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
And I hear her outside.

410
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
And I hear

411
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,280
I hear

412
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,280
And the door's open.

413
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,280
And Christina screaming.

414
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,280
Um, she dislocated her kneecap.

415
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,280
Well, it was located on the outside.

416
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,280
Oh, that's so horrible.

417
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,280
And that freaking hurts.

418
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
Yeah, no kidding.

419
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
That hurt so much.

420
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
Yeah.

421
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
And.

422
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
I said, I mean, is this?

423
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,280
Mom, you see your mom is here.

424
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,280
Yes, she didn't, she did.

425
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:40,120
a nitrous oxide. They gave her nitrous oxide so she told you. She's sucking on something.

426
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,240
Yeah, he is. She said she was really stoned. I'm stoned.

427
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,800
She was saying that. She was saying I'm stoned. That's my daughter.

428
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,000
Yeah. So anyway, so she's been home now for her.

429
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,560
How do you know about stone darling? You said that night, so they popped it back.

430
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:03,240
Yeah, so no, she had to, when she came in, you have to wait so long.

431
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,320
I think you die if you, if you know, if you're, I mean, obviously a kneecap.

432
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,600
This okay, kneecap is a press, press, or it's you in.

433
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,120
Yeah, of course, but there must be some other people with, I mean, it's not life-threatening. So

434
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,520
no, it's just like any emergency room. The ambulance is they, they are all queuing

435
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,560
with their, with their patients for the patient. Sure. Sure. So took a while, finally a

436
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:30,200
Chinese doctor came and he said, well, I have to put it back. No, she screamed no. So they gave her

437
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,880
a letter, more, read on something else. More, more, more night or so.

438
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:39,240
We're relaxed, her, her muscle. And while the muscles were relaxed, he puk her pop. Pop the

439
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:45,240
back. Pop the back. Pop the back, so that was it. But now it's like sort of a baby head. It's so.

440
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,000
It is, man. It's huge. Yeah. But as it's, and I'm going to do her show with her today. So she'll

441
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,240
tell, exactly what happened. She'll tell that part of the story because she's ready to do another

442
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:01,240
pod save the queen. Yeah. Yeah. So, all as well, the end's well, I guess.

443
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:07,320
Me. Yeah. That's, that was pretty frightening. It was actually, I felt so horrible. Of course.

444
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,680
And I said, oh, go, it's beautiful. Well, and I feel felt so guilty about it. See, Mom, I shouldn't have

445
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:19,160
got, oh, yeah, she's going to lay that out on the road for quite a while. You know, fried, I know

446
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,800
you don't listen to the show. But Friday, I played another song for you, actually. I know,

447
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,400
but you know, sometimes I talk about you. And I'm, but we'll play another song for you.

448
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:33,800
Yeah, but didn't I tell you that if I sit and do things on the internet, that thinks in the house,

449
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:39,000
and it's all about it. It's in the refrigerator. So I said to you, you know, I know now that it's

450
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,200
not good when Mommy sit, you know, and this, and it's automatic. You don't have to sit and listen.

451
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,200
You can just walk around, like you listen to Terry Morgan, except you actually have sex with me.

452
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,680
And not with Terry Morgan. No, but I, you know, I need to hear the news and know that I got news.

453
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,160
And then you call, and then I hear you. No, but see, the thing is, is if you want to know really what's

454
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,560
going on, see, whenever we call, when I'm in San Francisco, the eight hours time difference. So either you're

455
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:09,560
going to sleep, or I'm going to sleep, or I mean, we're almost exact opposite to the clock. And I'm not,

456
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,040
and I'm high, right? And you're asleep. Right. So we rarely really have anything to say other than, hey,

457
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,800
how you doing, yet it's going great. It's 11 o'clock in the morning. And then you said to me, something

458
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,080
wrong, no, I said, tired. End of the day. Right. But if you, if you would listen to the show,

459
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,400
then you could hear what's going on. Okay. What's going on, dear? Well, no, I just wanted you to,

460
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,400
so someone else, a couple of other people were listening to the show. Yeah. And one guy

461
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,240
called in about this song that I played for you. Yeah, it's nice. It's kind of for an hour.

462
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:47,320
This is me. This is me. This is better. I've gotta go home. See, I'm screaming. I gotta go home.

463
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:53,240
This is my Pico. I'm the voice of Scotty eyes on children of the gods.

464
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:59,400
I mean, that's W. W. W. That's one of the gods done. Next. I'm also, uh, the guy who does the

465
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:09,240
creepy podcasting news with Garland P on the Sunday Go to meet in podcast, which is never on Sunday.

466
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:18,520
Anyway, I wanted to say that this song, when you play at the end of the SC410 on 6206,

467
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,840
happened to coincide with the last five minutes of my day and I'll pay it gave me the drive to get

468
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:31,800
one more thing done. I want to thank you for that. Thank you very much. I hope you've had a

469
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:41,240
soap, fake trip home and enjoy your girls. You hear this song? I'm going home. Yeah.

470
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,040
Yeah, it's very song. I'll play that some other time. Isn't it nice if you, you know,

471
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:53,560
you're happy to go home? Yeah. Go be the other way around. I got no place to go in. I don't want to go home.

472
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:59,480
Oh, it's so. Yeah. If you want to call in, uh, we certainly would like to hear from you this week.

473
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,520
I'm going to be home for a couple of weeks now. They've got nice. Yes. We have a numbers feed

474
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:15,720
to call in New Jersey. 201, 201, 605, 657, or in London, O2O7, 681, 3753. Because people have

475
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:23,240
called in for you as well, but now the comments are so old. It's warm. Is it just me or is it warm? No,

476
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:30,680
you know, I know, you know, you just put on the heater. Well, but you turned it down, didn't you?

477
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:36,440
I turned it off. Yeah. I don't know. My body is on the place. But I was called this morning because

478
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:42,680
it's a wet outside. That's making a little bit, you know. So what the hell did you do for two weeks?

479
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,160
You were, you know, I know what you were doing. You were watching football. I was watching football.

480
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:57,000
I had my, my, my, my, my, um, operation. It's nice to those pieces of, uh, of iron in my

481
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,440
image. Yeah. They put the metal rods in your head. Yeah. So I was very, very great. And I felt so alone.

482
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,600
Yeah. See, not, go ahead. Stick the knife in. Yeah. I feel, that's what, yeah. It's just not,

483
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,040
not good. No, it's not good. I mean, you know, you come home and then you teenage, you said,

484
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:20,200
oh, yeah, you went to the, uh, okay. How are you? Yeah, okay. He makes somebody eat for me. Yeah.

485
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:27,480
And now I want. And now I would like to, uh, yeah. I was amazed at how into the football you were.

486
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:33,560
I was in meetings and you were sending me the score. Yeah. You were texting me the score.

487
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:39,160
I said, this can't be my wife. She must be there with like three guys. It's impossible. Yeah.

488
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,920
I've never known you to watch football. Even, they're so buy yourself. They're so good.

489
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Oh, yeah. This is it. I think since David Beckham is, uh, you're smiling and your eyes are,

490
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:59,080
are just twinkling all of a sudden. Great bodies. And I'm waiting at the end of the, uh,

491
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:05,880
thing, when they take off their shirts. Oh, are you really serious? No, of course. No, I think you are.

492
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,800
I'm too intelligent for that. What head of a port? Is that have to do with it? That's nothing to do with it.

493
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,440
I like it when women take off their shirts. I'm pretty intelligent. It's nothing. So,

494
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,160
literally nothing wrong with that. But Beckham, yes, they may be puking all over the place. That was,

495
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:24,120
yeah, well, that's interesting. No. No, I didn't think it was interesting. I felt bad for it.

496
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,680
Yeah, yeah. But what a goal, man. Yeah, but it was a real. That gave, they gave you a

497
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:33,480
beautiful, that was Beckham. That was Beckham, man. That was unbelievable. Yes,

498
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:39,160
today was a double header. Um, it was the Netherlands against Portugal. Yeah. And the winner of that

499
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,280
game would determine who would play against England. And I was so ready for a Holland England match.

500
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,640
And what a game. What a game. I mean, three guys kicked off the field. The most yellow cards handed

501
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:56,280
out ever. He was he for history. Oh, the, uh, the referee. He didn't have the game under control.

502
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:01,560
No, no, it was just handing out all those yellow cards. Yeah. But I think Portugal was a little

503
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,880
bit stronger. I mean. Oh, but they've, but didn't we didn't Holland lose against them in the

504
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,840
European championship? Yeah, I think they did. But you could just see the Dutch people on the

505
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:19,560
stands, just with disbelief going like, oh my god, how is this possible? Yeah, I'm not up. Oh,

506
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:25,320
we didn't expect this. Yeah. Well, it makes it easy. It had a hard time. They had a really hard time.

507
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:31,000
Yeah, well, it makes it easy because now all we have to look for is a little bit the way they played

508
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,680
was a bit like street fighters. You know what I mean? Nasty. Well, and I thought there might be

509
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,960
some not something else here because, you know, the Netherlands and Portugal always, you know,

510
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,320
had a lot to do together historically throughout hundreds of years. And if anything, the Dutch

511
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:50,280
are always vacationing in Portugal. Yeah. Maybe the Portuguese are just a second time of the Dutch

512
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:55,080
coming to their country and build golf courses that they just like, we're going to kick your ass. Yeah,

513
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,120
now we're going to kick your ass. Yeah. Well, but this team, this Dutch team, next championship,

514
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,680
I think they'll be, they'll be really good. Yeah, it was pretty much all new guys. Yeah.

515
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,320
You know, Snyder and fun. Look at me knowing all this shit. But listen, what's happening to me?

516
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:15,560
They weren't actually not, not, they were actually from other countries. You know, they buy those.

517
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:21,240
It's not fair, you know? Well, one or two, one or two, one or two, one or two, we're, one or two,

518
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,560
we're Dutch. No, they're all Dutch. They're all Dutch. Yeah. You have to be Dutch.

519
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:32,280
Yeah, of course. Because I, you know, some of them were even in Portuguese. In case you had noticed,

520
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,880
there's like a lot of immigration that went on in the middle of the past 15 years. They just bought

521
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,880
those. You know, let's buy a couple of new food bulk players. No, that, that works. Isn't it possible?

522
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:51,240
Well, no, not really. In fact, they tried to get, there was another guy who's been playing for

523
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,800
Dutch team. I don't know all their names. And he's not a Dutch citizen. And they tried to,

524
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:01,720
to get him on a fast track to get him citizenship so that he could play in the, in the world cup,

525
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:07,160
for Holland. But they refused to fast track him. No, of course not. No, why? Why would just because

526
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,080
if a football player are you going to give him preference over everybody else? No, of course not.

527
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,600
So what you also didn't hear is I've been trying to figure out the history of the word football.

528
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:22,120
And why in America, it's called soccer. Okay. And I, I, would you, I always want to get how it was

529
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:27,560
one of them. Thank you. I was wondering. Well, what's got soccer to do with your cha cha friends?

530
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:34,280
I've been saying soccer soccer soccer soccer. Okay. So your, your Charlie friends have been,

531
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,440
oh, shoot. It's not like windows closing. If you listen to serious stars, we got a whole

532
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:43,080
three and a half hours of pod show podcast lined up for you. But if it goes to hell,

533
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:52,040
way is next and I'll talk to you tomorrow. Okay. So in America, I can't go through the whole thing

534
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:56,280
because we've learned most already in the past two weeks. We were talking about this when you

535
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:03,000
went listening. But it comes from association football, association. Oh. So that's how they got the

536
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:11,480
sock association sock, SOC. But then what I didn't figure out is how to the curb get land

537
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,520
and get added on to it. You got sock curve. So the sock I understand from SO, you know, association

538
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:23,960
is ASOC. So they just took the SOC. And member Malcolm from Abu Dhabi. Malcolm, you know,

539
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,720
you will when you hear the voice. I think he's going to demystify how it became, it went from

540
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:37,560
association to sock to soccer. I much appreciate your encouragement with regard to starting my own

541
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,880
blog. There's a DSR on the way. And I think I'll start in a regular audio cast from the sandlands

542
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:50,360
after the summer break. I appreciate somewhat less being outed as major Tom from way back in the

543
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,600
day of space oddity. Remember the guy now? This is the guy who directed the major Tom video. He

544
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:00,520
outed himself by the way. Oh. Yeah. I'll start now. I've heard him. And it took a long time before I could

545
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:06,120
find someone who could send me the photo you found on Flicka. Why so long? Because Flicka is not

546
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,400
accessible from the United Arab Emirates. The sensors want to protect people from having to see an

547
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:17,720
awful photo of a strange looking get who was snapped at some kind of event in Can of which for

548
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,400
some reason I have no recall whatsoever. He's not interesting that in the United Arab Emirates

549
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:28,680
that like Dubai, that you can't reach Flicka, you know, Flicka where we have our pictures too.

550
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:34,120
Oh. Yeah. It's censorship. Oh. Yeah. Because they, you know, because it's naked pictures.

551
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:40,200
Stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. But the reason I am once again subjecting you to a

552
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,000
surface of turbulence is your perplexity would regard to the curve in soccer.

553
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:51,480
May I humbly offer the missing link? Yes. We have to thank the students of the 1880s for the

554
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:58,200
word soccer. The well-bred students of Oxford had the affectation of abbreviating words and then

555
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:05,560
adding err to the end. Breakfast became Brecker. Football played according to the rules developed

556
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:11,800
at rugby school became Rugga. Oh. Those who had this preference were disparaged by players

557
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:17,720
of association football rules as Rugga Buggers, which typically killed two birds with one stone.

558
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,920
The obvious retaliation was to abbreviate the term association Oxford style to soccer.

559
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:31,640
Google answers confirms this by the way. And that's it for today from Malcolm in Abu Dhabi.

560
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,440
Thank you very much, Malcolm. Well. But what's so what's doubly interesting that actually the

561
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:42,600
name was developed in the United Kingdom by Oxford University. But how come when you guys play

562
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:50,120
a football on the table? It's football. Well, no, that's football. Well, that's a good sound like

563
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:56,600
football. Well, it's because the game was, I think the game was developed in Germany, the

564
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:02,440
table top of the ball. So that would be football. Yeah. And that just became a brand name. It

565
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,680
just became a brand. So I think we should get one of them. Maybe we don't we have a football table

566
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:12,760
somewhere we had one. No. Yeah, New Jersey we had one. Sure we did upstairs. Remember? Yeah,

567
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:18,760
that's right. Yeah, that's right. Whatever. You know that we had, we were because we moved so many

568
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:23,960
times. I sometimes don't remember what kind of shit we feel about like where has this in the

569
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:30,920
where is didn't we have this? And then we have no clue. It's either in Holland in storage or thrown

570
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:36,360
out or sold or given away somewhere. There's so much shit I don't know about anymore. And I really

571
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,880
don't miss it quite honestly. No, but we have to go and take a look. But wouldn't the football table

572
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:56,200
look beautiful in that house? Yeah. So radio is 100 years old. This week did you know that?

573
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:02,680
No. Yeah. Oh, second. I have it here. Which I think is so antique.

574
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,840
Yeah, there you go. It's officially antique. Yeah, that's an antique. 100 years old. Which you can

575
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:13,720
hear now then. So now we can actually say an antiquated medium. Yes, it is. The web page isn't

576
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:19,320
coming in. I'll put it in the show notes so you can take a look at it. But yeah, pretty interesting.

577
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:25,000
100 years old. So, oh, it all out's loading. Let me see. Load, crap, bitch. Here we go.

578
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:31,320
Christmas Eve. Okay. It's almost. Christmas Eve 1906. I guess it's almost 100 years old.

579
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,520
Oh. Apparently Canadian inventor Reginald Fessendon made the world's first radio broadcasts

580
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,440
where wireless operators and several ships need land to pick up an unusual program transmitted

581
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:46,200
over their radio sets. This wasn't the first actual radio transmission. But he was broadcasting

582
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:52,280
a recording of Handel's Largo. Okay. And they did his own performance on his own violin.

583
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:58,520
Ah, nice, nice. So I thought it would be particularly nice in conjunction with this email

584
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:04,520
message that I got from Marcus Couch from the scenes scene. He does this and the pod

585
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:11,080
hit music rewind. So he's a pod show network podcast. And so he sent a private email to me.

586
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,000
I'm just going to read a little piece because it really touched me. I really like it. Thanks again

587
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,400
for the video cast plug. I received great positive feedback. I'm quitting my day job of six years

588
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,040
and moving to Orange County, California on July 31. The compensation I've received from

589
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:29,640
Pod Show has enabled the opportunity for my wife and I to make the move. Her son and nephew are

590
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,080
there and the move will bring us all together again. We really appreciate everything you would

591
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,240
poncho provided us and I can't thank you enough. Ah, in that beautiful. That's beautiful.

592
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,640
And this isn't and it's not like we, I mean, this is just based upon his own creativity and

593
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:50,040
performance. And anyone who signs up because, you know, we're about to unleash if anyone knows,

594
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,840
you know. So that anyone can do this. And here's a guy who actually made it happen.

595
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,600
I mean, I just love it. That's what you want to know. Exactly. And I'm just like, I read and

596
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,400
there's more, there's a whole bunch more to it. But remember, you told that that story on TV

597
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,560
in Holland and everybody laughed. Oh, that I said, everyone will have their own brother,

598
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:16,840
the transmitter. Yes. Oh, yeah, they all laughed. They all laughed when. And we're reset it.

599
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Who's got the last laugh now? Yeah. All right, baby. So what are we going to do this week? What

600
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:36,840
else do we have going on? I don't know. Just enjoy each other. I guess. And I have to go to Holland.

601
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:43,160
Wow, that's right. Yeah, I have to do that. Yeah, me too. I got to, I got to get my,

602
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,160
and there's something ahead. Oh, my, I got to finish some paperwork, which I have to do with the

603
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:56,360
the consulate. Yeah. But we have to wait until Christina feels a bit better. Yeah. But she'll be,

604
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,560
I mean, she'll be walking around in two days. That goes much faster than you think. Today,

605
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,880
you saw the difference with her knee today versus yesterday. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think she'll be able to

606
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,200
go for. She should be able to go to school tomorrow too. Yeah, she's going to try. But she can

607
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:14,600
do, she come to the steps. She has to go upstairs with the class. Does she have a friend who she's

608
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,520
in every class with? I don't think so. No, she's going to, they're going to keep her downstairs

609
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,160
and I'm going to bring everything to. Really? That's what the, the teachers at this morning to me.

610
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:30,280
Okay. So, and we may be, we'll find some other houses to see if you want to see it. Okay.

611
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,120
Interesting. Well, I'm glad we're going to be here. Glad I'm going to be here for a little while.

612
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:39,240
Oh, and Ron's coming over next week. Not this week with next week. Yeah.

613
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:46,040
With Marta or probably. Yeah, probably. Yeah. We're going to, you know, we're working on the

614
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:51,400
big advertising campaign. It's going to be so fucking cool. Oh, man. Yeah. I got to show you some of the

615
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:57,960
video we've done. Yes. Yes. It's going to look really good. And what else? Mmm. I don't know,

616
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,360
nothing actually happened. You're going to do really in two weeks? Yeah, I guess nothing happened.

617
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:07,560
I'm not here. Yeah. Nothing happened. Of course. A lot of things happen in the world. Thank God.

618
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:12,200
But it's nice and quiet here. And the afterwards supper looks serious. You know, full on the hill.

619
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,480
Uh-huh. Proceeding here on the hill. Okay. What's good to see you again, huh? Good to see you too, baby.

620
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,680
Yeah. And by the end of the day, I'll probably tell him how you came in with the beard.

621
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:31,880
We were disgusting. I was trying to stay away from that conversation. He said, I had a

622
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:39,800
you man. What? Everybody knows I had the beard. Oh, you, you, you said that. Yeah, I had a little,

623
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:46,440
I have a little bit of beard. A little bit. He comes in. I mean, I literally, the door opens.

624
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:56,760
And I'm like, hi, and you go, and Christina, what? It hurts. It hurts on your face. Even though you

625
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:03,560
are women who like it. We don't. No kidding. You actually, you're like gagging. What's this?

626
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:11,320
That she is. Hello. Hello. Heather. Heather. What did you say?

627
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,480
Heather wants to go. Heather wants to go. Heather wants to go downstairs.

628
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,960
Heather, you know. Yeah. Really? Why is mom, you go?

629
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:24,520
Don't know. What else do you, what is your got to do with someone? She was married to John Lennon.

630
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:29,560
There you go. Yeah. And John, then, and listen to her. Okay. No, no. I know. And you listen to me.

631
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,440
And Heather Mills was married to Paul McCartney. And Heather, you don't have one leg. Don't even

632
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:39,880
make jokes about that. Be lucky you have to. That's what I said. You know, can you imagine? Every time I

633
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:46,440
said it, can you imagine? Can you imagine if you, if you look at her leg, it's like twice the size of the

634
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:53,080
other one. It is. You're so lucky. So we're going to do a pod save the queen today. You got the

635
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:59,800
tracks ready? No. Well, once you, once you fall down the stairs. Okay. Full down the stairs.

636
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,040
All right. Good. Then we'll end the show. And then we'll help you. Yeah. Can you see mom's doing something?

637
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,920
Yeah. I need to hobble. Just a moment. Okay. Can you, can you sit down for a second?

638
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:20,680
Yeah. Wait in line. All right, Yoko. I guess I can go. Yoko. Oh, man. All right. I'm going to play one

639
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:26,120
more song. And then we'll take a bite. Okay. Oh, this is from New Jersey. I think you're like this

640
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,160
guy. It's great song.

641
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:42,840
I put a new guitar on the only credit card that I had maxed and now I'm walking down the

642
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:48,520
track. There's the rhythm parts. No job, no home, no hard. Got the knowledge to kill.

643
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:54,040
Cherry, big trash, hell. With a rubbish and watch the cars roll up a ramp.

644
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:59,320
Had the sun take slow and throw in the shadow of the ship of factory cross. The

645
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:06,840
BQP race leads through doors of the bars. My wish it be on. I got a record deal and all the

646
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:12,200
records I can see him from the midnight show. How did the pirate trade deal behind the

647
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:19,480
side? Emily and E-Line. Broke has the line between pipes and pants. I know how to turn

648
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,920
