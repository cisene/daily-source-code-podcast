blightybtpodshot.com, single-handedly making a man's for giving you Madonna.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,880
One show at a time.

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The end of course, your host, Adam Curry, Delta Sierra Charlie, 4-9-8.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,680
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation

6
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,680
radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:53,680
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:28,680
You like sleep alone and I say, I miss the way you breathe, you say, I get away

9
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,680
with you.

10
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,680
You know I've paid for it, and someone can't leave me.

11
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:48,680
Do you feel something when you're back and they see something you want to see

12
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,680
you get, I could be the one.

13
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,680
I could make it up to you, say goodbye.

14
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:13,680
I'm the only boy, I love you.

15
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:26,680
You say, I broken heart because we I say, I tell it sheeps to you, say.

16
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:33,680
You say, I'm the only boy, I love you.

17
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,680
You say, I'm the only boy, I love you.

18
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,680
You say, I'm the only boy, I love you.

19
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:52,680
You say, I'm the only boy, I love you.

20
00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:10,680
You say, I'm the only boy, I love you.

21
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:21,680
You say, I'm the only boy, I love you.

22
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:50,680
You say, I'm the only boy, I love you.

23
00:03:50,680 --> 00:04:01,680
You say, I'm the only boy, I love you.

24
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,280
Never ceases to amaze me when I hear a song.

25
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,880
That's, yeah.

26
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,160
Think, hey, that sounds like you, too.

27
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,320
And then you go to the artist page.

28
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,280
And there it is.

29
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,360
Influences, you, too, echoing the bunny men's

30
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,920
psychedelic for his radiohead and prodigy.

31
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,440
And I believe if it's not, then it should be part

32
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,400
of the recommendation engine that you find at poncho.com slash

33
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,120
music because what a great amount of data that is.

34
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,600
Instead of having to kind of figure out what other people

35
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,240
have listened to, add to that the data that the artist feels

36
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,800
that they sound like, you, too, or influenced by echoing the

37
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,680
bunny men cross reference.

38
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,880
Look at other artists who have done the same thing.

39
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
And voila, you have a recommendation.

40
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,800
It's Thursday, everybody.

41
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,640
How you doing?

42
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,000
Coming to you from the Curry Cottage in actually a rainy

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,880
affluent suburb of Surrey, known as Guilford.

44
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,480
Been busy.

45
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,680
Been, well, as you know, Mr. Mom Patricia's coming home

46
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,440
from Rotterdam later tonight from her rehearsals for

47
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,040
strictly come dancing, as we call it here in the UK, or

48
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,520
dancing with the stars in the rest of the world.

49
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,680
Last night was a late one for me and other folks in the UK

50
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,160
office because we had our monthly management meeting, which, of

51
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,120
course, means we all dial in video through iChat or Skype

52
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,080
video, multitude of protocols and formats and systems.

53
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,160
And it was very good, of course, but around 130, I definitely

54
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,920
started to fade and Christine was coughing all night.

55
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,040
That's that's that flu, man.

56
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,000
That's exactly what I had a month ago, and I'm just not

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,520
getting over it.

58
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,160
And you know, on top of all that, her knee, I remember she

59
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,120
dislocated her knee about four months ago during a field day,

60
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,680
or sport day, as they call it here.

61
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,560
And actually it was doing quite well as she and Patricia

62
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,480
been to the gym a couple of times.

63
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,360
She was thinking about doing some more horseback riding.

64
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,640
And I think a week ago during PE and school, she

65
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,160
heard her knee again.

66
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,400
And now it's swollen, and it's quite swollen.

67
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,000
So I took her to the doctor this morning.

68
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,200
And a doctor said, well, there could be a piece of

69
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,040
cartilage that is roaming around there.

70
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,840
And of course, it, you know, gets jarred loose and floats into

71
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,640
other places and it can hurt and can irritate and you need to have an

72
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,960
MRI scan.

73
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,080
That's no big deal.

74
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,520
Now, in the UK, they have a national health care system,

75
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,880
the NHS.

76
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,280
I think it stands for National Health Care Service

77
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,760
or system.

78
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,160
I don't know.

79
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,560
But it's nationalized health care.

80
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,200
Which, of course, comes with good and comes with bad.

81
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,080
The good, seemingly, is that you get free health care, just about

82
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,080
anyone under 16 gets free medication.

83
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,280
If you have to buy medication and you're over 16, I think there's a

84
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,920
cap on what you can pay, like five pounds, essentially

85
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,400
10 bucks no matter what the prescription is.

86
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,000
That's kind of your copay, which is obviously quite low.

87
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,520
So, you know, that is without doubt the good news.

88
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,400
Of course, anyone in the UK listening to this show will say,

89
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,320
oh, but it's a crap system, it's bankrupt.

90
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,520
But of course, because it's nationalized and everyone's sharing

91
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,880
the resources often people die unnecessarily.

92
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,200
That's just the way it goes.

93
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,960
But at least, I think the majority of people are enjoying the

94
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,000
benefits.

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,080
Now, you certainly can understand that with Patricia's

96
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,800
cardiac condition, I have private insurance as well.

97
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,800
And that private insurance, of course, is for the entire family,

98
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,880
and it's quite comprehensive, it's very expensive insurance.

99
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,720
By the way, every single pod show employee has medical insurance,

100
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,640
has health benefits, including dental benefits.

101
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,240
And every company that I've built, and certainly the ones that

102
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,040
run and I've done together, that's always been something where

103
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,680
we're very, very keen on is making sure that everyone is properly

104
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,200
insured and can be healthy.

105
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,360
So, when the doctor said, well, Christina needs an MRI, I said,

106
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,360
well, how long can we get one?

107
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,800
She said, well, you know, it could be two weeks or whatever.

108
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,280
And the kids in pain, you know, just so you know, I'm more than

109
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,680
happy to pay for it privately, because I know that I can

110
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,480
declare that from my insurance.

111
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,720
If you think that will speed things long, she said, oh, yeah,

112
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,320
well, I'll pass that along.

113
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,960
So, we barely even got home in the hospital calls.

114
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,520
Yes, calling for Christina's MRI.

115
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,920
And, you know, do you have health insurance?

116
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,520
Yeah, but it's based in the Netherlands.

117
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,920
So, I'll have to declare that and get the money back.

118
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,280
So, you know, I got to pay him up front.

119
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,640
It's 500 pounds, 1000 bucks for an MRI.

120
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,320
And I said, well, you know, how quick can you get us?

121
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,520
Then she said, well, you know, any time today, if you like, I said, well,

122
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,520
I thought it was really busy.

123
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,720
Because that is certainly the impression I got from,

124
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,000
from the doctor who, of course, wanted to send us through the,

125
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,760
the, the national health care system.

126
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,560
Just, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we've got plenty of spots open today.

127
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,080
You know, almost any time this week, you know, and whenever you want to.

128
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,000
And so, it struck me that, you know, there is a huge disconnect there with the

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,960
health care system, because clearly the resources are there.

130
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,320
And this, you know, people always complain about having to wait.

131
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,920
And I basically do the same thing.

132
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,120
She, I don't want to wait two weeks.

133
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,960
Kids in pain if she needs an operation to remove cartilage, then we've got to get this

134
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,840
movement.

135
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:21,840
But I think what happens is the national health care system probably buys a block of time,

136
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,560
because they use the same MRI machine.

137
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,680
I, I omitted that piece of my explanation, because it's very expensive equipment.

138
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,360
So there's, it's kind of a time share.

139
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,720
But I guess the only bite in blocks were very small blocks.

140
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,160
And, you know, and this is where it breaks down for me, because everyone who's in line for an MRI

141
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,960
is going to get the MRI, whether it takes a day, a week, or a month, or a year.

142
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,760
Eventually, they will get the MRI.

143
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,480
So to me, it seems like you're going to be paying the money anyway as the national health care provider.

144
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,880
You know, why not buy a bigger block of time?

145
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,920
If you, and I'm sure that comes down to the actual accounting of how it all works.

146
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,920
And maybe politicians sit in, in parliament and say, look, we're going to get to everybody

147
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,120
eventually.

148
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,920
So why don't we just spread the cost out over more years?

149
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,160
Could be, but it was just, to me, it was, you know, almost flabbergasting that here's this resource

150
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,960
sitting there.

151
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:21,520
And if we go through the national health care system, which has to pay for it anyway, you have to

152
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,080
wait, even though it's just sitting there idle, not doing anything.

153
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,320
You basically eating a wattage from from being in low power state or whatever the

154
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,280
held these things do.

155
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,680
So, uh, interesting.

156
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,240
Good old ducto called in through the voicemail line.

157
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,120
That would, of course, be the UK voicemail line number, which I want to kind of program that

158
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,320
went into your memory as well.

159
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,520
So feel free to assume.

160
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,240
Remember, add the plus for extra savings.

161
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,400
You're just, make it functional on your mobile no matter where you are in the world.

162
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,800
So here's the, you see the sparkers when they show, so that's noise.

163
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,080
And so I really know these buses and love that song you, uh, open the show is.

164
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,360
I don't know if it's echoed, but fast, or buses, if you call them.

165
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,800
And in Scotland, and I think in some sort of thing, then sucks fast.

166
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,520
And that's the type of cheapest, if you're blind, I don't even know what it is.

167
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,800
The minted fruit for some sort.

168
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,400
But it's cheapest, cheap, cheap, you get, and you see, uh,

169
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,040
poppers of it, get to the round the trains late at night, aren't you, ladies, and seen that.

170
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,760
And it's also a favourite with, uh, you know, um, the same kind of people who's,

171
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,080
jinx tenants, or such and fruit.

172
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,320
Um, anyway, I sure have a great funny, a band called Buckfast.

173
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,280
Okay, bye.

174
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,960
Well, there you go.

175
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,080
Learn something again.

176
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,880
Buckfast.

177
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,360
Yeah.

178
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,320
Bravo uniform Charlie Kilo, Fox start Alpha Sierra Tango, Buckfast, Buckfast.

179
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,920
Buckfast.

180
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,720
Yeah.

181
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,000
I got to get me a bottle of that.

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,880
Is that a brand name or is that the actual type of liquor?

183
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,800
And, and Joe, a doctor, call me from somewhere quiet.

184
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,600
Next time, will you?

185
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,960
I hated, you're always calling me from the bus or on the street.

186
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,960
What castle won't let you call from the house?

187
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,400
Are you embarrassed that you're calling me?

188
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,720
Come on, baby.

189
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,600
I don't want to hear you.

190
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,640
That's such a sweet voice.

191
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,840
You know, I've been, uh, on the, uh, window side of the personal computing equation

192
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,840
for quite some time now, uh, being a lifelong Mac guy just totally got fed up with all the hardware

193
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,200
failures couldn't deal with it couldn't live with the in unreliability.

194
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,720
And so I've been using windows and actually, uh, friend of mine last night said, uh, hey,

195
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,640
you know, do you miss the Mac?

196
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,280
Because I was, uh, actually, uh, using the Mac for, uh, for the I chat for the, for the conference,

197
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,640
uh, for the management meeting.

198
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,120
I said, you know, when I sit behind the Mac and of course,

199
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,440
I don't have, uh, a Mac book pro.

200
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:06,160
I have a G4, which, uh, oh, only, uh, a year ago with state of the art, 17 incher, uh, which, of course,

201
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,840
has been repaired and come back and other batteries crap, you know, the batteries fully charged,

202
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,800
you unplug it, you use it for 10 minutes batteries completely dead.

203
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,400
So that's how I received my power book back from Apple.

204
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,640
I sent it off with a good battery as far as I can recall.

205
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,840
Maybe this is their safety measure.

206
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,920
It's probably one of those batteries that blow up so they just make sure it doesn't work anymore.

207
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,320
Um, and then I was thinking, you know, do I miss anything, uh, of the Mac on Windows?

208
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,600
And besides some of the display things, the Mac is really, it's just slower.

209
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,600
I know the MacBook Pro is probably on par with my via dual core, etc.

210
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,520
So I'm not going to say that's a real comparison, but I really don't miss anything.

211
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,520
Some things do just work simpler and better.

212
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,400
Um, not know, not even better, but just simpler to configure things, you know,

213
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,040
less steps, more intuitive, but once you kind of understand, uh, Windows and you've got it down,

214
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,360
it's no problem whatsoever at all.

215
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,240
And of course I got rid of that stupid, um, uh,

216
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,160
tele-tubbies background that XP comes with by default.

217
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,200
I don't know if something is that.

218
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,400
I put a nice OSX background in.

219
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,880
Um, for some reason, and I don't know if there was a Windows update,

220
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,640
that's another thing I don't really like, um, you know, sometimes that you turn it off and say,

221
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,040
you know, don't reboot and do shit without me saying it's okay.

222
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,000
And sometimes it just does it anyway when it's a critical system update.

223
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,720
Um, but now when I open up dialogs within an application.

224
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,240
So let me just use cast blasters the example, because that's where it's most irritating.

225
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,320
Um, so it'll open up a, you know, so you say, okay, I'm going to add a file to cast blaster.

226
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,680
It opens up a dialog box.

227
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,560
So not a folder.

228
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,680
The folders are okay.

229
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:55,360
But in a dialog box now, it opens up and it is in the pretty much the default,

230
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,120
which is sorted by name.

231
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,880
And I want it in detail mode.

232
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,360
So I can see, you know, um, file size, et cetera, any other information.

233
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,200
And I want it listed by date, uh, last modified.

234
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,280
And I want the most recent modified files, which is the ones I just put into that folder,

235
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,560
because that's how I prep my show.

236
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,600
I want them to be on top.

237
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,080
So I don't have to go hunting around for stuff that I've just added.

238
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,640
And, you know, so I'll, I'll set it and it takes two clicks for set it to details.

239
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,840
Then it takes three clicks.

240
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,120
Then click on date modified.

241
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,800
Click on date modified again so that it sorts from, uh, most recent at the top.

242
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,760
Select the file, uh, click okay.

243
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,480
And I'm good.

244
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,600
And then I do it again.

245
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,480
And it opens up in the same default mode.

246
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,600
And I've tried everything.

247
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,240
I've tried opening up the dialog box and set the properties.

248
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,160
You know, I say, sort this way.

249
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,440
It just, it won't stick.

250
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,800
I don't get it.

251
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,280
And that is really frustrating.

252
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,200
Please, if you can help me on that, it will be greatly appreciated.

253
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,280
I think I'm doing everything right.

254
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,640
Um, in fact, let me just do it right now while we're here together.

255
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,000
So I'm going to open up.

256
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,440
Okay.

257
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,120
So it's opened up my DSC-bin folder.

258
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,880
And it's listed now.

259
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,480
It's in, uh, what mode is it in?

260
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,680
It's in list mode.

261
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,240
And it's sorted by name.

262
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,280
Uh, I can see because it has the folders at the top and then it starts with the one

263
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,400
o one o one o one and then pretty soon it gets to a.

264
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,640
Now I'm going to go to details mode.

265
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,960
And I can see date modified.

266
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,920
Of course, I have to expand the dialog box because date modified is the third one to the right.

267
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,000
Click on date modified.

268
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,200
Click on it again.

269
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,880
And so now I can actually add something.

270
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,880
So let me just add something here.

271
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,080
Okay. Now I'm going to do it again.

272
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,680
I open up boom.

273
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,960
It's in default mode again.

274
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,480
It's very, very frustrating.

275
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:51,120
And then, you know, so when you open up and then you right click, there's like properties

276
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,560
and properties gives me sharing, customized.

277
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,120
That's all.

278
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,280
Then do anything for me advanced.

279
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,680
God, this is the stuff that I really hate about Windows.

280
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,200
Okay, okay, that's not it.

281
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,360
Please help me out.

282
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,480
Can't you help a brother, huh?

283
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,120
I really want to understand how this works because it wasn't doing this before.

284
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,240
Something changed.

285
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,000
And then, I don't know.

286
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:22,320
So Windows is successfully added over three clicks per part of my daily routine.

287
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm liking that.

288
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,600
Hello, they spirit is coming my friends.

289
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,720
Steve Webb here, host of the Life Spring Family of podcast.

290
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,280
Beginning on December 1st, the Life Spring Advent calendar will make its debut.

291
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,120
Together with James Cooper of the WhyChristmas.com website,

292
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,600
a brand new Life Spring member will begin that will enhance your Christmas season.

293
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,800
Each day from December 1st until Christmas,

294
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,280
James and I will be talking about Christmas traditions from around the world and helping you to

295
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,600
focus on the real reason for the season.

296
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,640
We'll discover how many of our traditions began like the exchanging of Christmas cards,

297
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,480
bringing trees into our homes, and the singing of Christmas carols.

298
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,880
And of course, we'll talk about the very first Christmas gift, the birth of Jesus.

299
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,400
If you love Christmas like I do, I think you're going to love the new Life Spring Advent calendar.

300
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,000
You can get the show at advent.podshow.com.

301
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,360
James and I are excited to bring you these very special new shows.

302
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,240
Come join us for the Life Spring Advent calendar from the Life Spring Family of podcasts

303
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,760
and WhyChristmas.com.

304
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,160
Nice.

305
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,560
Advent.podshow.com.

306
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,960
I would mind knowing why we exchanged gifts and why we bring trees into our house.

307
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,080
I'm going to it right now, Advent.

308
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,320
Of course, it is automatically switched now to advent.btpodshow.com.

309
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,200
Which is kind of cool. We can finally got that working.

310
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,480
That was also a source of some of the feeds messing up.

311
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,360
Is this the kind of the digital version of...

312
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,520
Remember you had, I don't know if you still have the calendars and on December 1st,

313
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,680
you get to open a window and there's a little thing behind it and then all the way through to the

314
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,280
25th. Let's see each day from December 1st, they'll Christmas. James and Steve will be talking

315
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,360
about Christmas for today. I'm going to get this show.

316
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:24,240
So let me get this show. Get it and I'm going to add it to, which led to, I got a channel here.

317
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,480
I've got my on the go. Here we go. On the go. It has no episodes yet, but...

318
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,120
I'll be ready for when they do come up. Cool. Most excellence, Steve.

319
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,360
Christian Leonard says, Adam, in case someone is making notes about where splendid is distributed,

320
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,120
yesterday I spotted it on the shelves, then to shop here in Norway. I don't drink coffee.

321
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,040
I don't drink tea and I otherwise have no use for an artificial sweetener. However,

322
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,600
being confident about the fact that I could probably use it in some way or other, I bought a box.

323
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,720
I now have a large box of splendor on my shelf and no idea on how to use it.

324
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,560
But every time I hear splendid mention, well, I look over it and say myself long lines,

325
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:12,000
well, now why the hell did I buy this? I can say one thing for sure. If I ever find a way to use it

326
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,280
and get a regular use for sweetener, I'll be using splendor and thinking of the DSC every time I do.

327
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:40,880
I had some in here from SRAM Idol. You mentioned on a couple of shows ago that the

328
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,320
all tracks were now able to be purchased from the podcast music network. I just checked them out.

329
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:54,320
I went on to podshow.com as I do quite a lot of these days. It redirected me,

330
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,440
so they're going to podshow.com and redirects me to btpotshow.com. I wonder whether that's something

331
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,280
that you've got to have a new K. But if I'm going to be saying, you can still get to podshow.com.

332
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,960
But I can't, I always get forward to btpotshow.com. Which is fair enough. It's more or less the same

333
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:20,320
content and the same basis available. I was trying to find this button to buy music and I couldn't

334
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:29,280
find it. I don't know whether I just can't find it or whether it's just not a feature on btpotshow.com

335
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,680
and the podshow music tracks are only able to be purchased in the US. So if you question there,

336
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,000
I don't, I've been interested to hear what you have to say about those. Thanks a lot, mate. Cheers.

337
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,680
Yeah, I'm in command. You're going to tell me something. I don't know.

338
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,920
Okay, a couple of things here. First of all, we have integrated the pod save music network

339
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,240
into podshow.com but really the audience side of the equation. Which the pod save music network didn't

340
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,840
do a very good job of. That was really intended for a place for artists to put their music up

341
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:08,720
and for producers of podcasts and other independent programming to put them on a playlist,

342
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,880
mark them download them and report back that they've played them. Now, we have show note links.

343
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,640
I'm this is music.podshow.com which I'm here in the UK now. Let me just double check. I'm pretty sure

344
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:27,440
that music.podshow.com just want double check. Yeah, that just results to music.podshow.com. That doesn't

345
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:36,240
go to anything else. We have their links in there on each artist page. The takes you to an artist page

346
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,680
which we call the show notes friendly link. And I just opened up a ticket for this in our

347
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,160
system because I want this changed. So if you copy that link, which I've been doing for the,

348
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,400
you know, even though the new podshow pluses out, I've just been kind of, you know, a creature of

349
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,960
habit, right? You just right click that link copy it, paste it into the show notes. That will actually

350
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:02,000
take the listeners to the pod save music network. The old pages where you see, you know, it's a

351
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,840
sparse page. Let's put it that, that, you know, no recommendations. Now, the new artist pages

352
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:15,120
at podshow plus include a lot more information. They include, you know, recommendations. There's

353
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:21,840
a playlist that pop up all kinds of groovy stuff. And actually, I think, you know, much, you can actually

354
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,280
get all the songs from an artist, put them in your collection and you can play them through the

355
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,520
dashboard later if you want. There's all kinds of great stuff. But we need to change that link

356
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,160
obviously because we want, I want my audience to go see the cool page, not the sparsely, you know,

357
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,960
kind of hop-alongacity page that we've had for how, what is it now two years, almost. We've had the

358
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,440
pod save music network up, something like that, two years. Yeah, getting close to two years.

359
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:53,440
So that has to change. And I believe the second part of your question, Simon, is, you know,

360
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:01,440
if when you do go to podshow.com slash music, any artist that has songs available for purchase,

361
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,080
it'll show up in that little play or next to each track, it'll say buy, it'll be highlighted,

362
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:13,760
if you can actually buy the track. So now there may have been some weirdness when you call this in

363
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:21,680
because although it sounds pretty simple, really creating a localized version of something big,

364
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:28,080
like podshow plus, it is quite complicated actually. You know, you're sniffing out where IPs are

365
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,120
coming from and, you know, there's stuff that you that you do want to portray in the English version

366
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,040
stuff. You don't, and of course, with it brings a whole nother set of what we put on the home page.

367
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,160
I mean, it's a whole bunch of things going on and on that actual cutover, you know, DNS has to

368
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:47,040
propagate. It's all kind of technical jargon. What I'm saying is it all sucks, but it'll fix itself.

369
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:55,680
I think, so far it's working for me and the UK feeds are now also updating quite nicely.

370
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,560
Hi Adam, I'm the manager of a band called Three Blind Mice, an aims Victoria, or sometimes I'm

371
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,800
called the Farmers Wife. We've had some tracks available on the pod save music network for pod

372
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:10,240
gasters to play for about a year now and we're really grateful for all the pod play and all the

373
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:16,160
positive feedback we've received. However, we do need that pod play to translate into sales and we've

374
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,240
heard you for the past years saying it's coming soon. It's coming soon. Soon, all artists will be

375
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,680
able to sell tracks on the pod save music network. That's exactly how I sound. That is exactly the hype.

376
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:31,040
So imagine how excited we were earlier this week to hear you say, finally, we could make

377
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:36,080
our tracks available for sale directly through pod show plus. Yeah. Well, I paid off the promise

378
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,800
didn't I? So I rushed to our artist page on the PMN to check it out and I found out the payments

379
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,760
to artists will be made by check in US dollars. Well, with international banking charges the way

380
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,560
they are, that means there's no point in us making tracks available for sale yet. Okay. I'm going

381
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:56,400
to stop you right there. Not with that attitude, madam. Not with that attitude. What do you think

382
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,400
you're all you're going to do is nickel and dimes off this stuff? If that's all you think you're

383
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,160
going to do, and that's all you deserve to get. So, you know, yes, I'll let you finish your comment,

384
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,920
but I just can't stand that attitude. We'd end up paying the bank more than we receive.

385
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:15,200
What I wanted to ask you is do you know if there are any plans to make payments to UK artists

386
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,560
via PayPal? Thanks, Adam. I don't mean to seem ungrateful, but we have waited a year.

387
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,400
Oh, and since you asked, I'm a folder. Yeah, it's crunchier. Oh, the mood takes me.

388
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:36,160
Nice voice, by the way. Mm-hmm. But before I get wrapped up in that, that's strange because,

389
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,320
you know, we don't actually touch the money. As you know, pod show takes nothing of the sale.

390
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,880
We have priced it competitively. If you'll, you know, each track of the pod set music now work,

391
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,080
it should be no better or worse than anything anywhere else on Napster or iTunes. So 99 cents,

392
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,000
industry standard, I like that. Nine cents of that goes to a company called Click and Buy.

393
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,200
And we chose Click and Buy specifically because they deal with international payments.

394
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:11,120
And I believe they're even UK based. So it makes no sense to me that they only hand out checks in

395
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,840
US dollars. And I, of course, I totally understand what a pain in the ass that is.

396
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,680
I still have checks here from Amazon laying around from when I had cents sale on the home page.

397
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,000
And it lets like $1,000. I just like, I can't be bothered. You know, it can be bothered.

398
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,400
But it makes no sense that they're not cutting checks or sending out payment in in local currency.

399
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,520
I can understand some, well, no, I think it should be, you know, dollar should work. It should do

400
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,160
the euro and it should do the pound. Does it do euros, by the way? Because anyway, I was quite sure

401
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,360
that one of the main reasons we chose Click and Buy is for their international aspect. So,

402
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:58,640
I shall inquire on your behalf, madam. And while we're at it, let me see if I can make up for it with

403
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,920
a free blind mice, too.

404
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:41,440
I don't know how to be any pain, so I'm gonna sing it out like I think of the same as me.

405
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:51,360
One more between us until we believe in a star and a big offering free.

406
00:28:51,360 --> 00:29:05,360
Look to the north when the watch's always gather up your soul from the light.

407
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:13,280
Here's a way while the wind turns around to a time yet on time.

408
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:22,560
And the star sends you back to the sun.

409
00:29:43,280 --> 00:30:07,280
Look to the north when the watch's always gather up your soul from the light.

410
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:27,280
Here's a way while the wind turns around to a time yet on time and the star sends you back to the sun.

411
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:53,280
Look to the north when the watch's always gather up your soul from the light.

412
00:30:53,280 --> 00:31:09,280
Here's a way while the watch's always gather up your soul from the light.

413
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:33,280
So I don't know how to be any pain, so I don't know how to be any pain.

414
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:57,280
One more between us until we believe in a star and a big offering free.

415
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:21,280
Look to the north when the watch's always gather up your soul from the light.

416
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:47,280
Here's a way while the watch's always gather up your soul from the light.

417
00:32:47,280 --> 00:33:13,280
The watch's always gather up your soul from the light.

418
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:37,280
I will say that tracks and music have been completely commoditized through the series of tubes we call the internet.

419
00:33:37,280 --> 00:34:01,280
I can't tell you if I compare the time Christina has talked to me about a song or track versus the band that is playing somewhere.

420
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:25,280
This is a piece of feedback about the show where we're talking about Heather Mills and if I recall correctly,

421
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:40,280
I did step up a bit for Heather Mills who of course is the former Miss Lady McCartney or not even former yet because they're still married but they're in a very public messy divorce process.

422
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:48,280
Which of course is made messy and ugly by the press?

423
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:57,280
I think there's so many people calling in from the UK now.

424
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Just a follow-in from the last call.

425
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,280
Just a bit about Heather McCartney or Heather Mills or whatever you want to call.

426
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:13,280
She actually comes from not too far away from her.

427
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:35,280
I'm going to ask her to hear the press go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.

428
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:45,280
Just a funny grubber who's even behind boyfriend's back Marianne and well just a divorce together with Penny.

429
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,280
After all, it's certainly done.

430
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:57,280
It's not really up to when you're as to George but the last set up very important charity doing landmings.

431
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,280
I'm letting you know I understand that's what you've been up to.

432
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:08,280
And you know if you don't need to time and money to bury prominent causes.

433
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:15,280
And I just think it's about saying that the press just back off because I honestly don't think this is coming from men's of the public.

434
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,280
And this is the public really honestly don't give a damn.

435
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,280
I'm not really interested.

436
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,280
It's just probably crap in all stuff to stick on the front of your glossy magazines.

437
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,280
Let's have a go and a little headache.

438
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,280
Because we've got nothing better to do with our things.

439
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,280
I'm not more like for for.

440
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,280
I think she's a she's a canny last she's a bunny last.

441
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,280
You know good luck.

442
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,280
I just talk this thing doesn't get any worse for them.

443
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,280
It's a bit of a shame the Satan people split any two people.

444
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,280
You forgot fold or scruncher but I'll let you slide.

445
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:57,280
I really appreciated that comment because you know and when Patricia was doing this as well and boy I.

446
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:04,280
I'm sure she sometimes just may want to pop me over the head because I'm always the guy that says don't believe what you fucking read there.

447
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:12,280
You know how many times have we been on the front page and it's something completely stupid fabricated or so far from the truth that it's just not the truth.

448
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:19,280
And everyone believes it's the truth and we've definitely in our own little microcosm of the lowlands known as the Netherlands.

449
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,280
We've had that out of control thing happened to us.

450
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,280
It's it's not nice now.

451
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,280
Luckily it wasn't about divorce or anything like that but it's it's horrible.

452
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:36,280
And this is really nothing you can do about it and let me just say there's no difference between glossy magazines and web logs.

453
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:44,280
It's human nature people like to do this and and I just keep going back to that one that one comment I should look that comment up again.

454
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,280
The Robin and Suzanne from the inside works at me.

455
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,280
You know it's people projecting their baggage on to you don't accept other people's baggage.

456
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:59,280
Of course when it's when it's in the papers or when it's on a web log and most many people read it you know they happily accept the baggage.

457
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,280
I'll take that because I've got some of that and in fact it goes nicely with this piece of luggage I have over here.

458
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,280
So it just happens and you know we shouldn't be quick to judge.

459
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
Absolutely.

460
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,280
I had a whole I had a whole point to that and I was really going to go somewhere with it.

461
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,280
Oh yes I know.

462
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,280
This is why I love watching I'm a celebrity get me out of here.

463
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:30,280
I don't know if you've seen this program I don't know if it's as successful in the United States as it is in the United Kingdom but it's big.

464
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:36,280
So ITV program 8 million viewers at least that's what they had historically I don't know they just started so I don't know where they're at.

465
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:48,280
But I love this because you know you you find yourself being surprised at how judgmental you are about people thinking oh this guys like this this this this woman is probably like that.

466
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:59,280
And and of course there's a lot of manipulation because it is edited but in general it's a reality programming you do get to see a lot of the true people but again there's a lot of manipulation that takes place on the.

467
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:11,280
The the production side literally making it more fun to watch by trumping things up which is very easy to do very very easy in video particularly.

468
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:23,280
But as an example David guest is on I'm a celebrity get me out of here on the UK version he of course is known as Lysamonelli's ex and you think it would be this real slimy.

469
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:31,280
Dork and he's actually got something got a vibe about him I'm really starting to to like this guy.

470
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:38,280
And you know what the person who is the most shallow the most self obsessed and has the largest ego.

471
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,280
Is a journalist who is in the jungle.

472
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,280
She reblairs sister I forget her first name.

473
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,280
She reblairs of course wife of the prime minister of the UK.

474
00:39:50,280 --> 00:40:01,280
She's horrible she really really is and and by the way David guest called her out before that even went in the jungle just when they met each other he said oh you're the.

475
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:15,280
You're the person who was in the newspaper saying that I had a horrible face lift and I shouldn't stay in the sun too long because my face will melt and you know she was busted and she said oh yeah you know these were flippant remarks I shouldn't have made them and she didn't really even say I'm sorry.

476
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:25,280
But you know she had also just you know just one often just said stuff because she was being interviewed for going into the jungle and there you go celebrities.

477
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,280
You should say the journalist was more offensive.

478
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,280
Then then.

479
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,280
I'm getting stuck on what I'm trying to say.

480
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:40,280
It just blew me away that this came from a journalist or she calls herself a journalist I have no idea if she really is a journalist.

481
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:48,280
But anyway you got to watch this show it's fantastic because if you watch it kind of with an open mind and say wow I really thought this person was different than that good or bad.

482
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:58,280
It's just because you really don't know someone until you actually know someone which is why I defend Madonna which is why to a certain extent I defend defend Michael Jackson.

483
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:12,280
You know people who I've met and you know it's not like I hung out with them for days on end but you do get a vibe from someone when you look them in the eye your neurotransmitters are in close proximity actually making some kind of connection.

484
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:17,280
You do get a different a different view about someone.

485
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,280
What should we do well have you 41 minutes forget about it one more song.

486
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:32,280
Nigel who brought Thomas Dolby on to the podcast music network keeps emailing me and says dude you haven't played this song yet and you have to.

487
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:38,280
All right now I don't know problem clear but lie on your daily source code.

488
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:57,280
I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know.

489
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:07,280
I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know.

490
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:17,280
I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know.

491
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:32,280
I don't know I don't know I don't know.

492
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:47,280
I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know.

493
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:57,280
I don't know I don't know I don't know.

494
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:12,280
I don't know I don't know I don't know.

495
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:27,280
I don't know I don't know I don't know.

496
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:42,280
I don't know I don't know I don't know.

497
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:15,280
I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know.

498
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:41,280
I don't know I don't know I don't know.

499
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:57,280
I don't know I don't know.

500
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:17,280
I don't know I don't know I don't know.

501
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:43,280
I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know.

502
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:58,280
I don't know I don't listen to the slick mainstream radio anymore because you get sick of it.

503
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:07,280
I don't mind it's nice to hear something that's really slickly produced.

504
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:23,280
I have a lot of stuff happening at the Pod Show crash pad in London which of course I'm not able to attend now but I'm checking in regularly.

505
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:48,280

506
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:26,280
and more great ones like it on the BT Pod Show media network.
