This is Delta Sierra Charlie 457.

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:31,480
My name is Matt Weinstein, the Jewish Lesbian, I am a little free ski, and I hate George W.

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,760
But I love Adam Carey, and I am funny.

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:41,560
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, and the next generation

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:51,080
radio content in my ears.

9
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:58,360
Carey, this is not Antonio Panteras, but this is the judge, all 57.

10
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:11,760
Until we add him, his wife will mainly be greeted on your list, because Patricia is on mine.

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,080
Why is marijuana not legal?

12
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,080
Why is marijuana not legal?

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,160
It's a natural plant that grows in the dirt.

14
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,720
You know, it's not natural, 80-year-old dudes with hard-ons.

15
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,680
That's not natural, but we got pills for that.

16
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,200
We're dedicating all our medical resources to keeping the old guys erect, but we're

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,200
putting people in jail for smoking something that grows in the dirt.

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,760
You know, we have more prescription drugs now, that every commercial out TV is a prescription

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,760
drug add.

20
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,440
I can't watch TV for four minutes without the guy who has five serious diseases.

21
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,880
Like, you have a wake up tired in the morning, I'm like, God, I have this right to

22
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,480
down whenever it is I have it.

23
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,160
At the time, you don't even know what the commercial is, if people run it through fields

24
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,680
or fly kites or swim in the ocean like that is the greatest disease ever, how to get

25
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
that.

26
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,320
That disease comes with a hot chick and a puppy.

27
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,640
Schools and how it's all about self-esteem and a school, build a kid self-esteem, make

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
them feel good about themselves.

29
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,640
If everybody grows up with high self-esteem, who's going to dance in our strip clubs?

30
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,640
What's going to happen?

31
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,640
Our 4-0 industry.

32
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,280
These women don't just grow on trees and takes lots of drunk datties, missing a lot of

33
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,640
dance recitals before you decide to blow a goat on the internet for 50 bucks.

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,960
And if that disappears, where does that lead me on a Friday with my new high-speed

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
connection?

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:37,880
Mastermind's another word that comes up all the time, do you keep hearing about these

37
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,880
terrorists?

38
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,400
Mastermind's are being killed up in the middle of these terrorists.

39
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,240
Mastermind's sort of a lofty area to describe what these guys do, don't you think they're

40
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,240
not mastermind's?

41
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,040
Okay, you'll take farm, right?

42
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,880
And you'll put it back back and you'll get on the bus and you'll blow yourself up.

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,880
Why do I have to blow myself up?

44
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,880
Why do I have to blow myself up?

45
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,560
Who's the king mastermind here, real you?

46
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
Americans, let's face it.

47
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,560
We've been a spoiled country for a long time, you know what the number one health risk in

48
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
America is?

49
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
Obesity, obesity.

50
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,160
They say we're in the middle of an obesity epidemic.

51
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,280
And epidemic, like it's polio, like we'll be telling our grandkids about it one day,

52
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,080
the great obesity epidemic of 2004, had to get through a grand pie.

53
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,920
Oh, it was horrible, Charney, there was cheese, cake, and pork chops everywhere.

54
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,120
Nobody knows why we're getting fat, or look at our lifestyle, and I'll sit in a drive

55
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
to us at different.

56
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,480
I'll sit there, be on 15 other cars, instead of getting up and making a paper walk to the

57
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,840
totally empty counter, everything's a mega meal, super size, won't biggie fries with

58
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,280
that one, a jumbo fried one, a collage, one, a biggie fries, one, a 30-puggest

59
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,720
for a niggly, a prime on the floor, there's room in the back, take it.

60
00:03:37,720 --> 00:04:04,400
One, a 55 gallon drum, a coke with that, it's only three more cents.

61
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,200
Sometimes you've got to suffer a little in your youth, the motor may use to see later

62
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,200
in life.

63
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,200
You think if Bill Gates got laid in high school, you think there'd be a Microsoft?

64
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,960
Of course not, you've got to spend a lot of time, stuff in your own locker with your

65
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,240
underwear, wedge stuff, you're asked before you start thinking, and I want to take

66
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,560
all the world with computers, you'll see, I'll show them.

67
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,000
We're in one of the richest countries in the world, and the minimum wages is lower now

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,720
than it was 35 years ago.

69
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,000
They're homeless people everywhere.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,680
This homeless guy asked me for money the other day, I was about to give it to him, and I

71
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,200
thought he's just going to use it on drugs or alcohol.

72
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,520
And then I thought, that's what I'm going to use it on.

73
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,200
Why am I judging this poor bastard?

74
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,240
People love to judge homeless guys like you get in the money, he's just going to waste

75
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
it, he's going to waste the money.

76
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,240
Well, he lives in a box, what do you want him to do with it, save it up by a wall, you

77
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,200
want to take a little run of the store for a throw rug and a CD rack, he's homeless.

78
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,120
I walk behind this guy the other day, a homeless guy asked him for money, he looked

79
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,360
right at the homeless guy, he was much better, I'm going to get a job of him, people always

80
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,600
saying that to homeless guys, get a job, like it's always that easy, this homeless guy

81
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,560
would learn his underwear outside his pants, I'm guessing his resume ain't all up

82
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
to date.

83
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,360
I'm predicting some problem during the interview process, I'm pretty sure even

84
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,000
McDonald's has an underwear go inside the pants policy, not the day important, very strictly,

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:18,280
but technically I'm sure it's on the books.

86
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:25,040
Now the suggestion was, smoke some of the only herb, then listen to the song, but I don't

87
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,800
think that's even necessary.

88
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:39,720
Thank you very much Sam Green for suggesting that, let me give you all the details,

89
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,840
it's not on the pod save music network, you can find it's lazy boy and you can find it

90
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,880
on, what is it on my space?

91
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,400
Yeah, so I'll put a link to that in the show notes, wow that was awesome, like all

92
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,760
the bomb is going to do is spend the money on drugs now alcohol, wait a minute, that's

93
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,360
what I do with the money, everybody welcome to the daily store's code episode number 457

94
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,440
coming to you from the affluent suburb of Surrey, it's known as Gilford in the United Kingdom,

95
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,120
my name is Adam Curry, and not it's another beautiful day, I don't care where you are,

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,400
outside today and we've got a great show, a lot of response about half of the interview

98
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,480
Ron and I did, being held hostage by Joseph Jaffey, so your comments on that coming

99
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,840
up in this program, program, and of course some other nice little late bits and it's

It is day six of the Save Adam's ass camp, and I'm Amy Mack, right on, I got to tell

104
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,560
bathing fantastic, all right, let's get started, you're going to remain standing and your

105
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,080
legs are going to be wide apart, okay, wide apart, wide enough to squat, yet not wide enough

106
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,320
to fall over, okay, now this is a new one, so listen carefully, I want your toes to point

107
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,320
out to the side, and now you're going to squat making sure that you keep your chest, shoulders

108
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,480
and head straight up, okay, so, you want to go as far as you can or until you're even

109
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:29,680
with your knee, and then come back up, even with my knee, okay, okay, again you have

110
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,200
seven more, he's in the butt, his knees are in the same line as your legs, six, he's in the

111
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,920
butt, of course the knees don't come over the toes, five, he's in the butt, good, keep

113
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:56,040
want you to hold the last one down in the squat, all the way down, all the way down, 20 seconds

114
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,400
to go, watch, this is a great leg and butt exercise, it also focuses on balance and stability

115
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:09,160
too, right Adam, yes, yes, right up, 10 seconds, as always you can find me at fitness.potshow.com

okay Adam, you can come out, feeling pretty good, like crap, the answer is supposed to be great,

117
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:28,520
I can do more sets, oh well, next time, hey me back, he was so mean, hey me back,

118
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,920
I was prepared for it, I have something ready to go, well I catch a breath here,

119
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:54,440
this the hands of me, greetings, open more hands, I am Valquire, I can do, I'm in the god box,

120
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:07,000
a place you can linger before you make your way home, put down your swords, park your trusty

121
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:19,960
state, and leave your troubles here, one problem at a time, tonight, here's your cup of

122
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:34,040
meat, drink tea, three, then ask me any questions, brush to shortage, they will be answered as well,

123
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:50,120
oh man, see I was prepared this time, I had a promo standing by so I catch my breath,

124
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,520
you know Amy Mag does it to me every single time, is that last set and then she makes you hold this

125
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,760
for 20 seconds, did you try that, did you actually try that squat that she suggested for and hold

126
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:05,400
it for 20 seconds after you already done seven, it really hurt my thighs though, it was burning in my

127
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,040
thighs in my knees and wait a minute, no there is a little bit of burning sensation in my ass,

128
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:19,080
thank you Amy Mag, yesterday I told you the story about an interview that Ron Blumen I did,

129
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:26,200
it was about an hour and a half, we scheduled multiple time zones with this new marketing podcast

130
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:34,040
from Joseph Jeffy called across the sound and so he split it up into two parts and I told him

131
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,760
you know you shouldn't edit it at all, just do the whole thing, and so he decided to split that

132
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,400
interview into two parts over two episodes, which is not his choice, I don't like it at all,

133
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:50,280
I just don't like that personally as a listener, as a user, but then he went on this whole thing

134
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,840
about I hadn't sent him any love, no link, love, no traffic and so he was holding

135
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:00,840
part two of the interview hostage and so I kind of went off on that yesterday and of course immediately

136
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:08,440
revoked his permission to use any other part of as of yet un-aird part of our interview, forget about it,

137
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:16,440
I kind of made it my bitch, hey Adam it's Kevin Crossman from the Frappac podcast,

138
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:24,280
man you laid down the smack, that was awesome, when you told off Joseph and he held your interview

139
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:30,440
hostage and now you're holding his podcast hostage, I love it, I mean what did the guy expect?

140
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,160
Did he send you a promo, three to play, no did he talk to you about it, you know that you

141
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,720
needed to show him some love before you do your interview, no, if he did then that might be

142
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:47,800
sure, but I'm sure he didn't, you are the man Adam Curry, Boulder, thank you, well a lot of people

143
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,360
checked in including someone who always has advice and can tell you what to do when you're in trouble,

144
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,120
it's a little bit different though unfortunately, Peter I'm a satellite repair man coming after

145
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,240
you, satellite repair man watching on a new hill that you're missing,

146
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:11,000
and answer questions too, learn nothing in the universe and you can't do for you, a satellite repair man,

147
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:20,760
whew, satellite repair man, here it goes, I need money, Adam you owe me brother,

148
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,920
in your effort to put a snotty podcast or in his place, and the moral of that story is

149
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:33,080
not to give interviews to shows that nobody listens to anyway, in that effort you insulted

150
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,360
two of my favorite people, first, I didn't hear, I don't know if he added a lot, it didn't sound

151
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,880
like it in the first half, maybe some bits, maybe his own stumbles that he took out, that's that's

152
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,320
pretty typical, that's what Rob does, a forward podcast four on one, is he takes out all the

153
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:56,760
ohms in the stumbles that he does, it's just so, it's so contrary to what I like, I made an appearance

154
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:04,840
on Rob's podcast four one one show and let me tell you, the majority of the editing was done on me,

155
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:10,360
if Rob had chosen to leave that show on edited, it would have been, it would have been actually

156
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,160
entertaining is what you're trying to say, I hate it when you're editing, why? We don't have

157
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:21,160
any network news to hit, there's no penalty, who cares if you're stumbling and bump, you're

158
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,800
human, that's what it's about, I love it, that was, you know, I keep reminding myself, that's the

159
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:33,000
first thing I loved about independently produced audio entertainment, it was raw and it was like,

160
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,960
it wasn't those can things that were so used to, I love the rawness, it would have sounded

161
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:44,040
actually entertaining, Peter, at least an hour longer and people would have had no doubt as to why

162
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:52,920
I don't do digital flats in life and second, you will, I guarantee you that you have a very different

163
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,200
image of what Joseph Jaffee looks like, because actually he's a good looking guy, as, you know,

164
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:08,040
as guys go, but he sounds like, you know, Roger Smalls territory, that was just rude, without Roger,

165
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Uncle Jesse, the satellite repairman wouldn't even exist, he wait, that's right, screw him that

166
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,840
little twitch, oh we haven't heard from Roger in a while, I'm sure this will evoke some sort of

167
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:28,280
response, Peter, thank you. Oh yeah, there's more where that came from. Hi, this message is for Adam

168
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,480
Curry, my name is John Carman, I'm calling from the G-spotted division of G-mix.com, we are a queer

169
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,120
podcast and we're putting together a conference on Metro Sexual Identities and I wanted to invite you to

170
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:46,840
sit your Metro Sexual Ask Down on my panel, you could reach me at 412, oh fuck shit, okay, I've got to

171
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:57,160
redo that, all right, take it, take it, oh crap, shit, fuck, you didn't want us to, um, you didn't want us

172
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:04,200
to, um, edit, so all right, I'll try to be as wrong as possible, I just had a spare moment and figured

173
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:12,280
I'd give you a call on a second, hold it. Yeah, I just had a question about something you said on your show,

174
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:20,040
um, no, if we bend over, you'll not only give us love, but an interview, you know, I, uh,

175
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,400
like, by personally, I'm tempted, but I can't bend over, Sam, I'm already game married to another

176
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,840
big head, that's in the 80s, so, uh, what I can offer you is, uh, some of the drag queens and maybe

177
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,320
a trans-secret, we're two from our show, the G-spotted, give me a call, let me know.

178
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:46,200
Right. I was when I made Joseph Jaffee bend over and told him he was my bitch, I didn't say what was

179
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:59,240
happening, of course. Now Joseph Jaffee sent back a very lengthy MP3 file with an apology, but it wasn't

180
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:05,400
sincere. And, you know, and I'm only partially kind of, you know, making fun of this situation,

181
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:11,320
because, well, shit, something to talk about, right? Uh, but it, to me, if he thinks that, okay,

182
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:16,360
so now he sends me the apology and now we've created a little bit of buzz and, uh, and now everyone's

183
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:22,360
talking about it, now they're going to go listen, that's like, no, no, yeah, the, uh, the band is

184
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,120
still on Joseph, um, so there's no, what you sent me, I'm not even going to play it. That's how

185
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,240
pathetic it was as an apology. And, you know what, I'm doing it for your protection. If people

186
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,360
actually heard what you said, you know, they think that you're a douche because you, you know,

187
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,920
you clearly, you're trying to get some traffic to your show, which I think, uh, you know,

188
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,600
you're, you're, you're the new marketing podcast guru. This is it. This is how you do new marketing.

189
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,880
I don't think so. I'm not playing that game. Home, we don't play that game.

190
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,440
And others agree totally.

191
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:00,680
Hi, Mr. Curry. It's column was all here and I was just listening to show four, five, six.

192
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,280
And, uh, I've started that you haven't been playing enough of my audio comments. And, uh,

193
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,880
I'm holding your show hostage. Um, if this audio comments not played on the net show,

194
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,880
I actually refused to listen to podcast anymore.

195
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:24,920
Um, it seems that the revolution has begun. And, uh, I hope you understand my terms. Thanks. Bye.

196
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:32,600
So, unlike, uh, unlike George W. Bush, we do talk to terrorists here on the Charlie.

197
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:39,400
And, uh, that was an easy one. Good. So, we saved one listener there, fantastic. But, Joseph,

198
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,440
you're not other words, man. In fact, uh, since you have not been capable of coming up with

199
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:50,760
some kind of fantastic, uh, penalty or punishment for your horrible horrific deed,

200
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm going to open that up to the listeners of the Charlie. And, uh, they're going to decide what

201
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,320
your punishment should be for this clearly, clearly way off base action that you've bestowed upon me.

202
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,680
So, you know how to do it? Call into the voice mail.

203
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:20,440
One, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven.

204
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,880
Now so many people hate that, that jingle. I just keep playing it until you send me a better one.

205
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,840
Voice mail number, if you're entering it into your mobile phone, put the plus in it for, in, in,

206
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,400
in front of the number, plus one, two, zero, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven,

207
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,680
in London, 0207, six, eight, one, three, seven, five, three. Let me know what you think the

208
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,880
punishment should be for Joseph Jaffee's heinous crime. Hey Adam, this is Christopher Penn from

209
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,960
the Financial Aid podcast with a tinfoil hat moment about scrunching, folding, and what it says about

210
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,080
you. Use my conspiracy theory. You, Adam, career, are the party committing the conspiracy here.

211
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,120
Using the scruncher of folder survey to assess the socioeconomic background of the audience members.

212
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,880
What am I talking about? Scrunching and folding is largely a function of the quality of toilet

213
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,280
they we use. Good quality, higher cost toilet paper can be folded easily. Poor quality,

214
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,720
commercial grade toilet paper, like you find in fast food restaurants and rest areas and,

215
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,920
you know, highways, folds poorly because of its lack of quality. Mix it nearly impossible to fold.

216
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,840
Most of us learned our bathroom habits when we were young. Our homes growing up had a level of

217
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,160
toilet paper quality that dictated that our parents and therefore us, scrunched or folded when we

218
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,760
learned how to first use the bathroom. To where the papers are commodity, if you're cutting

219
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,120
gossip home, it's one of the first areas to be cut. And therefore it could be used as a

220
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,240
predictor of your socioeconomic background. The habits you learned then are still likely with you today.

221
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,160
Scruncher of folder tells the tale of your background and it's Adam Curry's secret waves

222
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,880
assessing your socioeconomic status. It's not 100% reliable by any means, but I would bet a whole

223
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,360
role of Sherman that the correlation is there. This is Christopher Penn from the financial aid podcast

224
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:55,320
with another tinfoil hat moment. See you all at Pod Camp this weekend. Yeah, that's really interesting.

225
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,800
Interesting analysis there, Chris, and I really do appreciate it, of course, with your tinfoil hat

226
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:07,880
moment. I should have done tinfoil tinfoil at moments.

227
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,720
But as I've said before, that doesn't really hold true because the richest guy I know who is

228
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:28,680
worth more than $100 million has his own aircraft and is a very nice guy is a scruncher.

229
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,480
So it doesn't really hold water. Now, of course, I'm sure there's got to be some kind of adjustment

230
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,880
for you and your calculations there. But that's not really why I said it up. The only reason I want to

231
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,600
know if someone is a scruncher of folder is, well, I can play the song, of course.

232
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,720
Hey, this is Sharon and tampon and just giving you a little bit of birthday wish and

233
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:18,760
listener profile female 41 widow mother of two boys. I'm an architect though. I haven't played

234
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:27,960
a net game for a while. I'm an online retailer and I'm a scruncher by nature, but I'm trying to

235
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:36,120
learn to fold. I have to say I like it better, but don't always think about it. Don't always remember

236
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:42,440
and, you know, frankly, just doesn't matter. But love the show. Thank you, bye.

237
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,760
Oh, thank you. I appreciate that so much. Single mom of two, everybody.

238
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:55,960
A milk sent me naked pictures. Please. Hello, Adam. This is Terry. Let me start off by saying I'm sorry.

239
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:02,360
I missed your birthday, but here's a belated birthday greeting. I'm creeping up on the same age.

240
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:09,720
So don't let anybody give you out hard time. It's really not worth it. You were looking for some

241
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:16,600
feedback on how your listeners are. Well, you know, the one area that you haven't touched

242
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:27,480
as far as your listeners and the spectrum is poetry or writing. You do excellent work with music

243
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:34,040
and pod show and the pod safe music network are awesome. I use them all the time. You've also

244
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:42,440
turned me on to several new podcasts. And I thank you very much, by the way, shuttle falls. Oh,

245
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:54,360
please, gotta keep it coming. Excellent. The drama. Anyway, happy birthday, belated, and

246
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:02,600
keep doing what you do because you make a lot of people very, very happy. This is Terry Witterdorf,

247
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,920
better known as the little red from Little Red's writing hood. Let me read.

248
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,040
Find the podcast. It's somewhere. Anyway, have a great day and keep Patricia on the phone.

249
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:19,640
You guys are awesome together. Bye for now. Bye. Love you. Me and it.

250
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,600
Yes. No, I was going to say something. I can't remember what I was going to say about that.

251
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:34,040
Anyway, thank you very much. I appreciate it daily source code.com or adamantpodshow.com.

252
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,520
And don't forget to keep your promos coming in through promos.podshow.com. We're going to start

253
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:44,280
something new on our serious satellite window. We've got four hours a day on the serious satellite

254
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:51,640
stars network channel 102. And we now and besides the shows that we have a rotation and we're

255
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,640
rotating more and more shows since we have, I was like a thousand shows on the network now.

256
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,560
Since we have so many of them, we're just trying to get as many people exposed as possible.

257
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,320
Those you're listening to serious stars want to know that by now every week they have to

258
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,840
new between six and ten you hear it all. But we also want to, since we, you know, there's no way

259
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,120
to feature everybody. You want to put in promos. So get your 60 second promos. Can be 30 seconds

260
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,760
but no longer than 60 seconds. I know it's counterintuitive to what pod castings all about, but

261
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:27,240
in the linear satellite world, we have, we do have top of the hours and commercial breaks to hit

262
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:33,720
and stuff like that. So put that at promos.podshow.com and we're going to set it up so

263
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,920
when you are featured, you'll know all about it. And of course, that happens every single day.

264
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,320
Monday through Friday from six in the afternoon to 10 in the evening, Eastern time on

265
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:49,800
serious stars 102. I'm going to do one more thing here for you and then we'll play a song.

266
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:55,640
I won't check this out. Hey, I don't make long time listener first time caller, not really

267
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,400
calling the first time. I know three or how long I second. Why is it mono?

268
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,280
I hate this. Can I make it mono like that? It was Mike. I was on the one channel. The hell was that?

269
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,360
It didn't sound like one channel when I set it up. Wait a minute. Maybe I can, uh,

270
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,520
oh man. There's no way to make a mono. Let me see if it gets better. Let me check.

271
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:23,560
Be sure of. It doesn't. Okay. Crap. I'm sorry about that. I'll play it tomorrow. I'll go

272
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:28,200
modify it. That sucks. All right. He's another song. Again, not from the pod save music network,

273
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:39,240
but I liked it so much. I was sent this to me. Howie. Howie. I put together a project called

274
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:45,480
ROTFLMAO, which I guess would be rolling on the floor laughing my ass off, which features

275
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:51,560
check this out. Ricky Lee Jones with Tom Maxwell and Ken Mosher of the squirrel nut zippers.

276
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,720
And I listened to the song, and you heard the song that I started off with today,

277
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,760
which was definitely a song to think about. Well, this is an, and of course, the name Ricky

278
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:08,280
Lee Jones caught my eye because, uh, man, Chuck Eason love has got to be one of my most favorite songs

279
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,520
of all time. You know what? Can we actually, uh, hear something? Let's try a little test.

280
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:17,720
Well, we're messing around, shall we? Let me open up Windows Media Player. This will be cool of this work.

281
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:26,840
Uh, let me see. I go to music. And I, uh, what the hell? Okay. I'm, uh, I subscribed to Napster.

282
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,560
You know, you know, the Napsters, you know, that illegal thing that turned kind of legal?

283
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,080
Well, the thing they've still got kind of right is the search function because, you know,

284
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,440
well, how cool was that back in the Napster days when you just go search for your favorite song?

285
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:45,960
It'll kind of show up. So now it does the same thing. Only, um, you couldn't, the, when you download

286
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:53,080
something and actually downloads. Let me see. Search. Ricky Lee Jones, tell me they have Chuck Eason love.

287
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,640
I can't believe it. They don't. Oh, no. Oh, that's horrible.

288
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:09,320
Wait, let me try the track. Uh, Chuck Eason love. Don't tell me they don't have that.

289
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:15,080
I hear it is. Uh, live. We don't want live. Uh, the LP version.

290
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:22,040
Thank goodness. Okay. Let's, let's see if I can play this for you. Play. Come on. Do it. Do it.

291
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,680
You, you love, I'll just play a little bit of the song because of course that's not pod safe either.

292
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,240
But when you hear this tune, I guarantee it's going to, it's going to just freak you out.

293
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:38,920
Connecting to media buffering 37% of the lead. Oh, yeah. Listen to that. Listen to that. Listen to that. Listen to that.

294
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,960
The quality of this recording is so good. You can actually hear the microphone come on.

295
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,040
You listen to this here. Be real quiet and out of the point out where it comes. Here comes.

296
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,280
Listen. Here comes.

297
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,520
I'll just get to the chorus for a second.

298
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,320
Cut out the code out the code. Yeah, sure. Okay. Listen to that.

299
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,320
Come on. Get to the chorus.

300
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:45,160
Well, it's getting so new. It's going to be the whole song before I get to the chorus.

301
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,320
I hear it. All right. It's the longer part of the tune.

302
00:28:47,560 --> 00:29:01,560
Thinking back, Chuckies love, Chuckies love, Chuckies love, Chuckies love,

303
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,720
Chuckies love, Chuckies love,

304
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,280
I don't believe. How good is that?

305
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,920
Oh, man. I wish I could share the whole song with you guys, but let's listen. There we go.

306
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:24,040
Okay. Yeah. Okay. Stop that. Let me just really make it really make it horrible and say that

307
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:29,400
that song was brought to you by the accurate target cast for the accurate new RDX SUV.

308
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,840
Find that it's accurate.podshow.com and by Earthlink, the ad challenge. We're about to announce

309
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,640
the winners. You can listen to all the finalists at earthlink.podshow.com.

310
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,880
And they have another one. Oh, yeah. If you want to say send that big-haired

311
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:50,680
tag from the 80s to jail for playing RIA Music on his podcast.com, use Chuck out code DSC3.

312
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:56,200
It'd go daddy.com. So anyway, back to the email that how he climbed sent. So he's put this

313
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,840
project together with Ricky Lee Jones and that's why it immediately caught my eye and he said the

314
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,480
play it. So how are we? I'm going to play it. Would you please be so kind to support this on the

315
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:16,120
pod save music network? Could you? It's it's it's really funky but the lyrics of course really

316
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:24,760
kick ass particularly because it's Ricky Lee Jones. And you can be a Lindy Hopper. Have you had

317
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,760
enough? Or do you still let me in?

318
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:24,760

322
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:00,360
network. Would you please? And that's it for today. Short, sweet, simple. I'm feeling good. Lots

323
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,480
of stuff happening. Next week, big announcement in the United Kingdom. So I'm going to say,

324
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:11,720
and after that, I hope to go back to San Francisco for a little bit and hang out with the crew

325
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:17,400
there. There's like five new people I haven't met yet, at least virtually I've met them, but not through

326
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:24,520
not in interpersonal contact. Yesterday, those of you in the UK probably have heard of

327
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:29,000
Dr. Cockney. Well, he was in San Francisco. And he dropped by the pod show offices, doing his

328
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,600
Dr. Cockney sex talk thing. And it was like 1130 here, 1130 midnight. And we had the video conference

329
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:42,040
going and there was a bizarre, I'm sure it'll show up in his show somewhere. DailySourceco.com for all

330
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:48,280
the links, et cetera, for things discussed on today's show in the show notes. And of course,

331
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:53,400

332
