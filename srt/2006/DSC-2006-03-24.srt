54
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,180
Do you kiss all the first names?

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,780
Let's do it all the first names!

56
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,780
What do you do all the first names?

57
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:24,160
Thank you very much, Jersey Todd, for sending that in this suggestion for kickoff of the

58
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,980
weekend festivities on the thank god it's Friday edition of the Charity Daily source code.

59
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,660
only guy from Jersey could really understand exactly what song you want at the beginning of

60
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,540
a show like that. Thank you, dude. Appreciate it. Hey everybody, it's the last day. The last

61
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:43,700
full day, last show day for me for this trip out west. Tomorrow, going back home, can't wait.

62
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,020
Gotta be really honest about that. Although it's gonna be pretty busy before we take off on

63
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,700
vacation for Portugal. So I'll still have shows all next week and I haven't quite decided what to

64
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:57,220
do in my absence. I know I want to do at least one, probably one or two shows from vacation.

65
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,380
I mean, of course, I'll be checking in, but I do really need to take a break.

66
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:08,420
For example, just last night as I came home. That was a long day yesterday and I stayed

67
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,500
late at the office because I was working on some video stuff which I'll talk to you about in a second.

68
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,860
So I'll come home and it's like nine o'clock and nine o'clock is like, you know, you could, yeah,

69
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,020
you could order some food if you want, but you know, so you probably won't be eating until nine

70
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:29,540
45 or 10. I wanted to prep today's show, but I just wanted something to eat and, you know,

71
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:34,180
hey, look, I'm a bachelor out here. You know, I got the complete tricked out bachelor pad. Right

72
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,820
now, I was funny. I was looking at last night. I got three high-end computers running here all the

73
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:44,980
time. This, you know, just gadgets plugged into every available wall outlet. Man, when Patricia

74
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:50,020
comes along with me in May when she's coming over. She's just gonna hate it so much.

75
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,500
But I don't have anyone to, you know, I don't have a lot of stuff here to cook. You know, yeah,

76
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,180
I've got my pantry filled up with stuff. And of course, you can always make some pasta, right?

77
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:04,340
And it's real easy. I like making the sauce and I've got all kinds of stuff herbs and stuff around

78
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,420
the house. Really easy to to whip something up. And that's always, you know, that's, that's like,

79
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:14,740
it's almost like nature's fast food. Let's be honest. So here I am and I've, and I got my pot and I'm

80
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:20,500
cooking up my, my pasta, angel hair pasta. And I have this, you know, this sink, which is really

81
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,740
this whole area. I really should take a picture of that shooting. I should publish a picture. So I've

82
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,540
got, I'm on the kitchen, open kitchen bars where my computers are, where the studio is. And then,

83
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:35,300
of course, there's a dual sink, you know, with garbage disposal. And so I've got the pasta. I'm

84
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,940
gonna, I know, what I didn't have is a strainer. I thought I had one, but I guess I don't. So I have

85
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:44,340
to get a strainer. So what do you do is you, you know, you grab the pot with the lid on and you

86
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:51,700
try and strain out the water carefully. So the, so now it's now it's 930 that I've got the finally,

87
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,460
I've got the pasta going like, okay, I'll just have, I'll just eat something, then I'll, you know,

88
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:01,140
I'll chill out and I'll go to bed. And, and I start pouring out the water. And I can, some of

89
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:06,980
you already know what happened. Yeah, exactly. All the pasta went right down into the garbage disposal.

90
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:16,980
So I'm still hungry. If you know what I mean. God, man, this video stuff is hard. I've been,

91
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:24,020
I've been working on, on figuring out how to, hey, how to get video stuff just right, you know?

92
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:29,460
And Apple is not very helpful in this because, okay, so what's very easy, if you just want to

93
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,820
make something and publish it to your iPod or, or make it compatible with the iPod, it's easy,

94
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:40,420
because there's an actual button there tab, a pull down menu that says iPod. So, you know, I did that

95
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:46,420
a couple times and of course, lots of people said, hey, I don't have quick time. I'm running Linux.

96
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:52,100
It doesn't work for me. I use a different player. And the consensus that I could see pretty much

97
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:59,540
was, you know, get yourself into the habit of creating real MPEG for video. Let me just see, I had,

98
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:08,580
yeah, for instance, super, right, that's a different one. And, and that's not easy. You know,

99
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:15,220
you try MPEG for and then it, it won't even play back properly on my machine for some reason.

100
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:22,180
It's almost like you're being forced towards an Apple way instead of something that would be

101
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,700
universally useful. And so, yes, I tried, I did the MPEG for, I did the, I used several different

102
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:35,540
settings. And, and, of course, when I put it into the podcast feed, it didn't make it in,

103
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:40,580
which means you may have picked it up, but not, if you were using iTunes, you didn't get it.

104
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:46,500
So, you'd actually have to download it and then you'd have to recompress it with the iPod.

105
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,580
You know, so mysterious what those settings are with the iPod setting so that it then will go into your iPod.

106
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,780
So, this, this means that unless I can figure out one setting that will also work on iPods,

107
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:04,900
as well as any other MPEG player, and I have no idea, now I'm really lost, you know, because I thought

108
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:12,260
I did it all right. I chose the MPEG for compressor anyway. And then, of course, as a question

109
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,620
of putting it into the feed. Now, this feed, my podcast feed for the daily source code is,

110
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,620
and that's a pretty valuable property. You know, anything I put in there is guaranteed to get to a

111
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:27,620
lot of people, or at least if I'm using the proper video codex. But not everybody likes it.

112
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:34,660
For different reasons, let me see, here's an email from Frederick. I want to say that a second

113
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:39,300
feed for the videos will be a good idea. I have a fourth generation non-video iPod, and my iTunes

114
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,500
set up to only copy the latest episode and delete the older ones. So, if you send out a video,

115
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,220
iTunes don't copy anything on it. Well, I mean, hey, look, this would happen if I did a whole bunch

116
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:56,580
of audio releases, too, your stuff would start to get deleted. In fact, Frederick does say that,

117
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,060
you know, this actually could be a bug on his system that iTunes won't copy anything to the iPod.

118
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:06,340
I don't know, man. I thought the iPod would take MPEG for an any version, but apparently not.

119
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:12,900
And then another piece of feedback about that from Andrew Stanley Jones. You mentioned no

120
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,660
and complain, so I thought I would. This always nice to have someone who will step up to the

121
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,220
plate, isn't it? I haven't since I think it's actually a bug in my feed fetcher. I don't

122
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,300
want to fetch the videos automatically. I can't see them on the nano and have a meter to internet.

123
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,100
I can only get 500 megs a day, yeah, that does suck. But that's life on the satellite internet

124
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:39,140
in BFE, middle of no rural Indiana. But anyways, it would be easy to limit what type of

125
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,780
enclosures it should fetch versus automatically fetching them. So, after all, I blame the software.

126
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:48,580
Okay, well, it is all kind of software, software issues. So, working on it, trying to figure it out.

127
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,580
And everyone has sent me different ideas and suggestions and different settings. And, you know,

128
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,820
we're going to figure it out one way or the other. And meantime, we'll just keep making the videos.

129
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,180
People seem to like it. You know, this was a very interesting test. And I think I really

130
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,380
have to document how I did it, because people think now that I have some awesome,

131
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,500
the software switching video, which it really was much simpler than that. Although,

132
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:15,700
Casplaster Mike did check in with me. He's on his way. He usually goes off for a couple of days

133
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,820
to go program and like the woods. It's not really the woods where he's going. But it's like the

134
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,780
woods. Which means he's getting ready to do a final release of Casplaster, I presume.

135
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:32,100
And of course, he's already been thinking about the video version of Casplaster. And,

136
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,380
and the other first pop up is what are we going to do about formats, because, you know, Windows,

137
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:43,620
the Windows Media format is much more prevalent, which also should be able to just create a simple

138
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,820
MPG. Anyway, if you've got info, if your tech heads, please let me know. But try and

139
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,620
and whittle it down because my eyes fucking glaze over at the stuff some people say. Oh, I'm

140
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,820
extremely stressed. Can't start a weekend without him, you know.

141
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:04,660
Comics trip. Comics trip. Comics trip. Comics trip. Comics trip.

142
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,180
As our friend, Comics trip blogger can't finish up a week without him, you know?

143
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:16,660
Ciao, ciao, I'm Kerry. Once upon a time I lived in Italy and spoke Italian. And I remember saying

144
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,460
once to my palpfabizio. But I don't know how to say it today. And he replied,

145
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:27,860
what funculo is cosy? Maiono, I begoto, Ilca, Ferrancoa. What could be translated as,

146
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:34,660
how are you today Fabrizio? And, fuck off, I haven't drank coffee yet. So, you see that for some

147
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,220
people coffee is important, but not for me. I don't drink coffee at all, so I am not digging

148
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:44,100
here, since I'm a belching advertisements. Sorry. But when you announced it now,

149
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,860
naturally as a deal with Go Daddy, I was happy I am very often good customer of Go Daddy,

150
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:55,140
and when I needed to add additional demand to my collections, for example, with blogger in the

151
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:01,700
main name instead of blog in the main name, I just go to www.godaddy.com and or the new domain

152
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:07,220
and they even have a very nice feature of privacy protection. So, you can buy internet domain

153
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:13,780
in the same time, hide from the word that this domain is released by yourself. Cool stuff.

154
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:20,580
Yo, dude, thank you so much, and then actual comic strip blogger endorsement for Go Daddy,

155
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:27,140
I love it, man, and it is true because I got an email from, was it, no, this was an email,

156
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:33,780
this was a comment that I saw on curry.com. Low and behold, someone has gone out and actually

157
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:42,260
done me a service by registering a domain name for me with GoDaddy.com. Yes, if you type in

158
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:51,220
bighairedfag.com, you'll see that it goes straight off to curry.com. Yeah, you know, these are

159
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,860
great gag gifts and they can be great love gifts and well, and I consider this one definitely to be

160
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:04,180
the latter. This is for generations of the government and the electorate have had an uneasy

161
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:12,420
relationship, a relationship based upon the politics of fear, power, and and harmony. The

162
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:20,180
media has often neglected its responsibility as the four branch of governments. As citizens

163
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:27,460
we can no longer tolerate this, but it is time for us to remain what is ours.

164
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:37,700
You can even use an independent politics with groupy sweet shows, college without affiliation

165
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:45,700
with a head of curry and an odd show network. Though some may snuff, groupy sweet and

166
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:52,740
perfectly boldly, that the others in the media have advocated its responsibility to a more

167
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:59,860
ordinary electorate. This is a journalism, this is the future, because we can no longer

168
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:05,140
lie among a government to tell us the truth, and because we can no longer lie among the

169
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:11,140
needs to help us make informed decisions. It is up to us to pursue an adverse

170
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:32,740
responsibility to join our show and release it as our audience support.

171
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:42,740
Oh man, right, dude, I'm expecting quite a lot from you now.

172
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,740
Nice, nice boots, jack boots in the background.

173
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:00,740
Okay, the pod people are coming creepy sleepy show in the pod show pod has not worked great to have in the board of course.

174
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,740
And there's so much love, so it's such an outpouring of love and it comes in all forms.

175
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,740
As you know, this is really one of the prime examples of a user generated program.

176
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,740
75% of the show is put together by the people who are actually listening to it.

177
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,740
And that's what I love so much about it because I can wake up in the morning.

178
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,740
And people who heard that, you know, I had problems during yesterday's show and, you know,

179
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:29,740
and I couldn't get the complete line out out in time to tell the folks who are listening to us on serious satellite that,

180
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,740
you know, that what else is coming up.

181
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,740
And it's just because I don't have a producer, it's shoot man, it's 730,

182
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,740
I'm sorry, 630, 630 in the morning.

183
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,740
You know, it's hard.

184
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,740
And then my friends come up and stand next to me and say,

185
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,740
we're going to help you out and we're going to help you get through the Charlie.

186
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,740
Hey everybody now, you know what that means?

187
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,740
Oh, the window! He's over there by the window!

188
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,740
He's a satellite repair man, what's he gonna do?

189
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,740
He'll fit your misconceptions and answer questions too.

190
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,740
He's turned nothing in the universe and he can't do for you.

191
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,740
A satellite repair man.

192
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,740
Woo!

193
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,740
A satellite repair man.

194
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,740
Hey, I just beat him!

195
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,740
Everybody.

196
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,740
Alright, beat up, come in!

197
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,740
Beat up, you out of me.

198
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,740
Beat up, you out of me.

199
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,740
I saw one that I saw.

200
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,740
I saw a satellite line up, are you ready to copy?

201
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,740
Ready?

202
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,740
After the daily source code, it's a specific code's hell-weight,

203
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,740
followed by East Radio.

204
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,740
And it's gone and grew, followed by Steve Gilmore's Gilmore Daily.

205
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,740
And we wrap up the satellite transmission with Wichita Rottenford's

206
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,740
Groove Crash Show, and our newest music show, the scene scene.

207
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,740
Have a good weekend at him on a tape trip home.

208
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,740
Coming up on Lawson Signal.

209
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,740
Thank you.

210
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,740
Let's do that one more time, man.

211
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,740
It just maybe feels so happy, especially for fun.

212
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,740
You know, we bet everybody, he's known as the EU.

213
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,740
The satellite repair man.

214
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,740
Coming after you.

215
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,740
The satellite repair man.

216
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,740
What's he gonna do?

217
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,740
He'll fit your misconceptions and answer questions too.

218
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,740
Learn nothing in the universe,

219
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,740
and he can't do for you.

220
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,740
The satellite repair man.

221
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,740
Woo!

222
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,740
The satellite repair man.

223
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,740
Here I go.

224
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,740
Alright, honey, we've got to get some airtime on the DSC.

225
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,740
And I've got some ideas.

226
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,740
I was kind of thinking that I could set him a spot for the Metro sexual

227
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,740
moment.

228
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,740
How does this sound?

229
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,740
Hey, Adam, I just want to give you some of my skincare ideas for your Metro sexual.

230
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,740
No, no, no, sweetie.

231
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,740
Sweetie, sweetie.

232
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,740
Okay, you are so not Metro sexual.

233
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,740
I mean, you don't have any hair to put mousse on.

234
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:50,740
And as far as I know, you've never removed any hair from any other part of your body

235
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,740
besides your face and hair.

236
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,740
I saved my legs one time for a swim mate.

237
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,740
Does that can?

238
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,740
No, sweetie.

239
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,740
Alright, um, that could be like a stalker.

240
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,740
The new Adam stalker.

241
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,740
A stalker?

242
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,740
Yeah, well, I don't know.

243
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,740
Just hang with me.

244
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,740
Hey, Adam, I saw you in Trinity this last weekend.

245
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,740
You were looking pretty good.

246
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:14,740
Ew, Robin, you did not see Adam in Trinity this weekend.

247
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,740
He doesn't know that.

248
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,740
And I'm an airline pilot.

249
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,740
I can be in San Francisco.

250
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,740
I can be in New York and be in London.

251
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,740
And is there something that you're not telling me about your layovers?

252
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,740
Uh, no.

253
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,740
No.

254
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,740
Uh, I sense you're getting a little tense.

255
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,740
You know what, honey?

256
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,740
We can talk about it.

257
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,740
Hey, easy on the psychology stuff, honey.

258
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,740
This is about Adam's show.

259
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,740
Not about me.

260
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,740
How about if I start bitching out of like,

261
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,740
Madge?

262
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,740
No, no, come on, come on.

263
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,740
Come on, come on, hang on.

264
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,740
Adam, you f***!

265
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,740
Get your hair!

266
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,740
You f***!

267
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,740
Why f***!

268
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,740
And the nair in the Netherlands, I don't f***!

269
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,740
Get it!

270
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,740
No.

271
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,740
Oh, that went well.

272
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,740
You think?

273
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,740
Mm-hmm.

274
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,740
Honey, I think that we should just speak straight from our heart

275
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,740
without any tricks or gimmicks and just say something like this.

276
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,740
Thanks, Adam, and Ron for inviting us into the patch of family.

277
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,740
No, try it.

278
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,740
Thanks, Adam, and Ron for inviting us into the patch of family.

279
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,740
Hey, that's not gonna get it.

280
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,740
Okay.

281
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,740
Thank you, and bye for now from InsightWorks.com.

282
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,740
That's Ion as YTWORKS.com.

283
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,740
Wait for it.

284
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,740
Here comes.

285
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,740
Tailwind.

286
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,740
Oh yeah.

287
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:38,740
And Robin is one of the people who definitely definitely can say tailwinds

288
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,740
because my plane is such a thinking to Ion compared to the ones that he flies.

289
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,740
Great to have you guys in the patch of podcast network as well.

290
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,740
Very nice.

291
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:52,740
It was InsightWorks that, you know, first, actually I got a lot of benefit from listening

292
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,740
to the show.

293
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,740
When they told me not to accept other people's baggage, it really made a difference in my life.

294
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,740
So it's much appreciated.

295
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,740
And great to have you guys, you know, your voice out here on the network.

296
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,740
Let's see what we're talking about.

297
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,740
Oh, you know, it's actually, it's interesting how much feedback I've received

298
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,740
on the Metrosexual moment, which we did the other day, where I talked about using

299
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,740
narrow on the other regions, narrow in the other regions, everybody.

300
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,740
Gosh, you know, Americans are freaked out by that.

301
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,740
What is it with, you know, is this a homosexuality, you know, homophobia type thing?

302
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,740
I don't know.

303
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,740
I mean, I just think that it looks so much cleaner and nicer and, you know, shit,

304
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,740
we're not in the 70s anymore.

305
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,740
And I go back to the porn.

306
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,740
Look at the porn, guys.

307
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,740
You look at women in porn movies.

308
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,740
Yeah.

309
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,740
Yeah.

310
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,740
Yeah.

311
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,740
And if you are watching that with your, with your woman, with your,

312
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,740
if you're watching it with your men, with your partner, doesn't matter.

313
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,740
Someone's looking at the guy.

314
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,740
And your wife or your girlfriend, your partner's probably going,

315
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,740
yeah.

316
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,740
But not if it's all one big bushy mess down there, come on.

317
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,740
Jesus, Jesus, Louise.

318
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,740
It's like everyone's like, oh, well, that's really weird.

319
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,740
I don't think it's weird at all.

320
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,740
But it only seems to be Americans who think that's really weird.

321
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,740
Yeah.

322
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,740
Anyway, just wanted to make that observation.

323
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,740
And we were talking about the album covers, and when we're talking about potsafe,

324
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,740
music, network, how I used to love that double album cover.

325
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,740
See, you had Frampton comes alive with a double album.

326
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:27,740
There was Stevie Wonder songs in the Key of Life, was a great double album.

327
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,740
We just folded it over and had all these great, great bits in it.

328
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,740
And then, of course, there was the Greece soundtrack, which had,

329
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,740
really, I remember looking at that album, a lot, the double album.

330
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,740
It all, you know, pictures of little fifties, trinkets on it.

331
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,740
And in the comments, curry.com, comments on the show.

332
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,740
Jimmy, Jimmy Crackhead said, speaking of albums,

333
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,740
did you have a favorite for getting seeds out of the bag of weed you just bought?

334
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,740
I was used Frampton comes alive.

335
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,740
There it is.

336
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,740
It's absolutely right.

337
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,740
Frampton comes alive, baby.

338
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,740
That was the best one.

339
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,740
Yesterday, the, the podpim came to me.

340
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:12,740
The podpim, Aaron Bersel, who does all our PR and marketing.

341
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,740
He's a pimp.

342
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,740
He's our podpim.

343
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:21,740
And he has, in his hand, a copy of the latest edition of Playboy Magazine.

344
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,740
And on the cover of this is the Go Daddy Girl.

345
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,740
And so here's the message I got.

346
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,740
He says, and it's beautiful, by the way.

347
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,740
Very voluptuous.

348
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,740
If you haven't seen the videos for it,

349
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,740
I think you can find it at GoDaddy.com.

350
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,740
Madge Weinstein played some of the videos.

351
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,740
Cali played some on Geek Brief TV.

352
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,740
So you can find them around.

353
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,740
She's stunningly beautiful in sexy.

354
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,740
And Aaron says, well, you know, this came from GoDaddy.

355
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,740
And it actually came from the GoDaddy girl who wanted you to have it.

356
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,740
And so, of course, I said, yeah, right bullshit.

357
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,740
And he said, no, no, it's really, really true.

358
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,740
The GoDaddy girl wanted you to have this.

359
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,740
And I'm looking at that.

360
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,740
And so the first of all, I say, hey, wow, that's cool.

361
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,740
Of course, I say, podpin.

362
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,740
Get her on my show.

363
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,740
Now I want to talk to her.

364
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,740
And she said, yeah, yeah, that's a great idea.

365
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,740
And then I'm looking at this picture.

366
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,740
And I'm thinking to myself, this girl is worthy of the list.

367
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,740
Now, don't tell me that if you're not married,

368
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,740
you don't have a list.

369
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,740
Because I think every couple has at least discussed the list.

370
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,740
You know what I'm talking about.

371
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,740
The list is the list of usually celebrities

372
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,740
that either one of you was allowed to have sex with

373
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,740
if you should happen to bump into them.

374
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,740
So, you know, we've talked about my list, right?

375
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,740
Angelina Jolie.

376
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,740
Patricia's list has Brad Pitt.

377
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,740
Oh, shoot.

378
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,740
People on the satellite.

379
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,740
You're not going to hear what happens.

380
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,740
You left to go to dailysourcecode.com.

381
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,740
Sometime over the weekend to hear the rest.

382
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,740
PCH next.

383
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,740
See you guys on Monday.

384
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,740
Okay.

385
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,740
Glad you're still here on the podcast.

386
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,740
So Patricia has Brad Pitt on her list.

387
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,740
I got Brad Pitt on my list.

388
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,740
And I'm thinking, I bet you.

389
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,740
If it's really true, if this girl want me to have the,

390
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,740
want to be to have that playboy, there's a message there.

391
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,740
I bet you I could swap Angelina Jolie for the Go Daddy girl.

392
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,740
I bet you.

393
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,740
I'll get back to you on that one for sure.

394
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,740
You know, dealing with most domain name registrars is like this.

395
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,740
Oh.

396
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,740
But dealing with GoDaddy.com for your domain registration needs

397
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,740
is like this.

398
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,740
Oh.

399
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,740
Yeah.

400
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,740
Yeah.

401
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,740
Oh.

402
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,740
Oh.

403
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,740
Oh.

00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,740

What are you doing?

409
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,740
Can I help?

410
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,740
Oh.

Oh.

414
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,740
Oh.

415
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,740
Oh.

And I've got a couple more pieces of feedback for you today.

428
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,740
No, not a sense.

429
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,740
Oh, just a nice cup of tea.

430
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,740
Adam.

431
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,740
Yeah.

432
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,740
Mr. Curry.

433
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,740
Yes.

434
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:46,740
I think you're the only man on a first name basis with the entire world.

435
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,740
Good morning.

436
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,740
Good afternoon.

437
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,740
Or good evening depending on where on the planet you are.

438
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:57,740
This is Al-Lock or aka Uncle Normie from a hate the radio.

439
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,740
Today I want to discuss networking.

440
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,740
Not the, hey, how come these email servers keep crashing?

441
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,740
So I know what?

442
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,740
I'm sorry.

443
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,740
You know what?

444
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,740
This is a really long comment that actually deserves a lot of comment for me and thought.

445
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,740
So I'm going to save that until next week if you don't mind.

446
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,740
Because it's Friday.

447
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,740
We got to move through to show you.

448
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,740
Yeah.

449
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,740
Adam.

450
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,740
It's Brian from the Procrastecast.

451
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,740
Yeah, Brian.

452
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,740
At the Procrastecast.com.

453
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:27,740
And I've been playing around trying to get into this podcasting game and I'm having a lot

454
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,740
of fun actually.

455
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,740
I had the audacity to put up the first eight.

456
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,740
That was in the last few weeks.

457
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,740
And audacity works pretty well.

458
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,740
I don't mind the program.

459
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,740
It's actually quite easy to use.

460
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,740
But the problem is once I get the music tracks down and once I get the, you know, the

461
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,740
show opener thing and whatever you call that, I don't know what the hell I'm doing on this

462
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,740
stuff.

463
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,740
But I'm modeling through.

464
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,740
And I get ready to do my comments.

465
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,740
I've sort of lost the mood.

466
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:01,740
It's like it's like having to put on a condom just when you're, you know, ready to do it.

467
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,740
It just kind of loses.

468
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,740
It just kind of fizzles.

469
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:09,740
And I'm afraid I, you know, anybody who's bothered to stumble on that show probably

470
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,740
fell asleep in the middle of it.

471
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,740
And that's not really what I'm going for.

472
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,740
I love playing the music from the pod safe music network.

473
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,740
And I, you know, that's kind of what I want to do.

474
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:25,740
Just play a few tunes and make a few comments and get it up, right?

475
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,740
And so my problem is, you know, the flow.

476
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:34,740
So I decided to go get cast blaster and, you know, the thing works.

477
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,740
I figured it out.

478
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,740
I was able to put some shows together.

479
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,740
Two programs or so I put together with cast blaster.

480
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,740
I was able to get it up really fast and really well.

481
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,740
And, and that's a good thing, right?

482
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,740
I mean, you, when you're ready to, to get it up, you want to get it up.

483
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,740
And so I'm not doing that.

484
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,740
That boring thing.

485
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,740
It's embarrassing.

486
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,740
I'm sorry.

487
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,740
I think you're really hot at him.

488
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,740
I really do.

489
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,740
But not that.

490
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,740
You know, while anything can happen, I doubt it's going to happen between us.

491
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,740
All right.

492
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,740
So are you going to interact with this cast blaster question?

493
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,740
Mm-hmm.

494
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:14,740
I know that you use it at least as why I've heard that you use this cast blaster software.

495
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:22,740
And what I would like to know is, while you can get it up fast, I'm missing some volume.

496
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,740
So the program just doesn't have the volume that I need.

497
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,740
And so that's kind of my question for you.

498
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,740
How can I get more volume out of cast blaster?

499
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,740
Do you do it?

500
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,740
Yeah.

501
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,740
You know, I was standing in front of the mirror yesterday, coughing and I said, damn it.

502
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,740
I need more volume.

503
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,740
Give me more volume.

504
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,740
I don't know what the, what the problem is.

505
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,740
And you need to basically turn it to 11.

506
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,740
So you got to crank your mic up so that the meters are hitting almost hitting zero

507
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,740
at the very end of the scale there in the reds.

508
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,740
And the same for the music.

509
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,740
And then it should be working.

510
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,740
And I don't know if you're talking about the volume that you are recording or the volume.

511
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,740
That you hear in your headsets.

512
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,740
You have to be a little more precise about that.

513
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,740
But I'm using it now.

514
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,740
And I got plenty of volume.

515
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,740
In fact, sometimes I have too much volume.

516
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,740
It does happen.

517
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:20,740
So yesterday we turned on portions of D-gap dynamically generated.

518
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,740
What do we call it now?

519
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,740
We change the name dynamically generated asset placement.

520
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,740
Ass placement.

521
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:34,740
And it's cool because now you can have multiple segments to any podcast that can be configured

522
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,740
dynamically through the network or through the individual podcast very soon.

523
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,740
And eventually I believe the listener.

524
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,740
And so we have these, we have the ability to insert a tag.

525
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,740
So you probably heard the beginning of this show.

526
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,740
And it, you know, it's all randomized.

527
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,740
And we have different grids.

528
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,740
So you'll hear P-dub doing a tag first.

529
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,740
And Brian, no.

530
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,740
We'll do a tag later.

531
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,740
And there's a whole logic to it, which is very cool,

532
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,740
a whole management system that we've created.

533
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,740
And so we started with the GoDaddy ads, which, or the GoDaddy tags,

534
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:11,740
I should say, which was it like you want a badass domain name for your killer content.

535
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,740
A rather short-sighted on the networking side from my point of view,

536
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,740
because I should have taken into consideration.

537
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,740
And of course, now we've automated this.

538
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:25,740
That should have taken into consideration that some podcasters may not like the term badass.

539
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,740
And in fact, Steve Webb, of life spring, as I told you yesterday, said,

540
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,740
Oh, man, you know, this won't go from my show.

541
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,740
He wasn't alone.

542
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,740
I had him into the Danny Caster lab rat beta tester from 100.

543
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,740
One uses for baby wipes with some audio feedback.

544
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,740
Hold on, it's Bita.

545
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,740
You're a beauty attesta.

546
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,740
Yeah, I've been attempting in vain to upload a show to the PDN,

547
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,740
since I was invited to join the network way back in February,

548
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,740
which, you know, in podcasting terms, like half a century ago.

549
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,740
Now, I've been very patient.

550
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,740
And my patients was rewarded today.

551
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,740
I was finally successful in uploading a show.

552
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,740
Woo!

553
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,740
Later that morning, I listened to the Chuck E 359er,

554
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,740
and heard you talk about Steve's dilemma over at life spring

555
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,740
and thought, I wonder, did that happen to me?

556
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,740
Now, I can cast bad enough to make a sailor blush, okay?

557
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,740
Enough said.

558
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,740
I just don't do it in front of my kid,

559
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,740
and I wouldn't want someone else's kids to hear it.

560
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,740
Now, the PDN is already asking if the show is explicit or not,

561
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,740
so just cue off that to decide which ad to attach,

562
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,740
so that we don't have to listen to bad ass.

563
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,740
Okay?

564
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,740
Bad ass.

565
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,740
Can you help a fellow podcaster out,

566
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,740
and then, you know, fix my one and only uploaded show?

567
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,740
Please?

568
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,740
Okay, okay.

569
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,740
I'm going back in my test now, see ya.

570
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,740
Oh, dude.

571
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,740
Totally appreciate that feedback.

572
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,740
And you know what? Great fucking idea.

573
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,740
Don't play that, what I just said to your kids.

574
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,740
Great idea.

575
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,740
So we immediately implemented that,

576
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,740
because yes, when you, when you create a show,

577
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,740
and you put it on the podcast,

578
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,740
the library network, you could say,

579
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,740
is this particular show explicit or not,

580
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,740
and that, of course, shows up in the tags

581
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,740
that are useful in other places, like on iTunes, et cetera.

582
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,740
And also, for our own internal system,

583
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,740
if it should you wish to filter by that.

584
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,740
So, first of all, I'm really glad that you got your stuff uploaded

585
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,740
because we've had, like,

586
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,740
I think, three of the beta testers have had issues,

587
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,740
and you were one of the final ones.

588
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,740
So it sounds like we got that fixed.

589
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,740
And yeah, as you know,

590
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,740
after he sent out this comment, he realized

591
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,740
that we had changed that, and we put the,

592
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,740
actually, you get PWM and Brian

593
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,740
cut some special new ones really quick.

594
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,740
This is what it takes man to figure out a real network of shows.

595
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,740
And so what we've implemented now,

596
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,740
what Andrew Romitt is doing, is indeed that simple.

597
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,740
But explicit, yes, then you get all the great ads,

598
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,740
or for that particular campaign,

599
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,740
or no, would be the PG version of the campaign.

600
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,740
So that's a great idea.

601
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,740
I really appreciate it.

602
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,740
Fantastic feedback.

603
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,740
Really works.

604
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,740
And the golden ticket idea, which I told you about,

605
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,740
we're going to try that.

606
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,740
I think Tuesday, Wednesday, next week,

607
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,740
it kind of depends on the timing.

608
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,740
Now, this is just going to be a test.

609
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:06,740
So the way it'll work is on a designated daily source code.

610
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,740
You'll either download it from the website,

611
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,740
or your iTunes will get it, or juice receiver,

612
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,740
or it's something, however you normally get the show.

613
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,740
And I think we'll do it this way.

614
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:20,740
The show will start off probably with a network tag.

615
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:24,740
And then before I actually start with the show tag,

616
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,740
you know, DeltaShare Charity, whatever,

617
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,740
you will hear, either I'm sorry,

618
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,740
you did not win the Golden ticket,

619
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,740
or you'll hear, congratulations.

620
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,740
You won the Golden ticket, call this number now,

621
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,740
with this, you know, with whatever password or code,

622
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,740
or whatever I'm going to use for that.

623
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,740
Because we'll be able to insert into one,

624
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:48,740
only one of the thousands and thousands of downloads

625
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,740
of this show.

626
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,740
And we're only testing it on daily source code.

627
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,740
One of the people who downloads it,

628
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,740
will actually win a prize.

629
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,740
And that's the thing that Sam Leaven hooked up

630
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,740
that iPod remote with the power remote,

631
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,740
the AV thing.

632
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,740
I'll get all the details on that Monday.

633
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,740
So be on the lookout for it.

634
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,740
One of these shows that's going to happen.

635
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,740
Now, of course, what could happen is that that show

636
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,740
will have been downloaded, but someone might not listen to it

637
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,740
for a day, for two days, for a week, or at all.

638
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,740
So it's going to be interesting to find out what happens.

639
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,740
And it'll just be at random.

640
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,740
So it doesn't matter if you're earlier late.

641
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,740
It'll be, you know, a rather large random generator

642
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,740
thing, because there's a lot of downloads of the show.

643
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:40,740
But we'll make sure that it will definitely be downloaded

644
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,740
within the first day, because that we can kind of figure out.

645
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,740
You know, knowing how many downloads there will be,

646
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,740
and we'll make sure that the numbers lower than that.

647
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,740
So, what else did I have?

648
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,740
You know, we could wrap it up now.

649
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,740
You know what, there's time, there's enough time for.

650
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,740
Should we just do one more?

651
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,740
I don't know.

652
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,740
I'm feeling kind of.

653
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:06,740
Yeah, well, you know, this was such a nice piece of feedback

654
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,740
from Greece.

655
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:12,740
And I don't think we've ever had a Greek charlie head on the show.

656
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:17,740
And also, full of really good ideas about the ID3 tags

657
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,740
conversation that we've been having on the pod safe music network.

658
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:26,740
Now, for those of you who don't know, ID3 tags are little pieces of information.

659
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,740
You can put into your MP3 file when you make it available to the world

660
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,740
or to your friend or when you make it public.

661
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:36,740
So that your player can actually, you know, display information

662
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,740
about the song or that file itself.

663
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,740
So if you look at your player right now,

664
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,740
you'll see that it says daily source, Adam Curry's daily source code.

665
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,740
It'll have some numbers there, maybe even the show notes appear.

666
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,740
All that information is baked right into the file.

667
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,740
And you can do some pretty interesting things with that.

668
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,740
And besides that, it's just, I said, I said,

669
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,740
Panayotes is just interesting to have on the show.

670
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,740
Hey, Adam, this is Panayotes from Greece.

671
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:06,740
Recording this message on my way to the office,

672
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:10,740
as I'm driving on my mobile phone,

673
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:17,740
here are some thoughts regarding the ID tags on pod safe music network.

674
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:22,740
I don't understand your approach that, you know,

675
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:27,740
we just provide the space and the community where it's our system market

676
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:32,740
and promote his songs or his songs.

677
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:43,740
And they are responsible to make sure that the customer gets the best,

678
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,740
how is the worst in some cases.

679
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:51,740
On the other hand, since the artists already provide

680
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,740
all the information needed,

681
00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:01,740
such as artist name, song name,

682
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,740
sometimes record name too.

683
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:10,740
It would be pretty easy to embed these information

684
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:15,740
in the MP3 files automatically.

685
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,740
What would be nice if you do that?

686
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:25,740
Well, there are two places where you could automatically

687
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,740
add the ID tags, ID3 tags.

688
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:34,740
One place is when the artist uploads the songs.

689
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:41,740
So you do that once, and the MP3 file has all the ID3 tags it needs.

690
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:48,740
The other place would be just before someone download the song.

691
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:53,740
This might seem a bit more with those consuming

692
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,740
because you will have to do this every time.

693
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:05,740
But on the other hand, this opens up a whole new space for promotions.

694
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:11,740
What I mean is that if you embed the ID tags,

695
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,740
I'm just listening to this and I'm thinking to myself,

696
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,740
isn't it amazing what we're doing here?

697
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,740
I mean, you take it so for granted what's happening.

698
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,740
But I'm sitting here in my kitchen in San Francisco.

699
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:32,740
I recorded some stuff and some thoughts about independent people's music.

700
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:35,740
And here's a guy in Greece on his way to the office,

701
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,740
recording something on his mobile phone,

702
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,740
and able to send it off to me and it's within our community the next day.

703
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,740
This shit just freaks me out.

704
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:49,740
Well, just before someone downloads the MP3 file,

705
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:59,740
you could say that every 100 downloads take your...

706
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,740
It sounds like the golden ticket idea.

707
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,740
Eggs of the songs.

708
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:10,740
And if you see the promo code, you have this gift.

709
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:18,740
Or an artist could add additional ID tags,

710
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:26,740
for example, what's his concert schedule for the next couple of weeks or months.

711
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,740
Or I don't know.

712
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,740
I think it would be a pretty interesting advertising space.

713
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:38,740
Or at least a nice tool to promote things.

714
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,740
Well, what was it?

715
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,740
I hope I helped.

716
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,740
Well, I do have a podcast in Greece,

717
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:52,740
but I won't mention it here since very few people will be able to understand Greek.

718
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:58,740
If someone knows Greek and understand Greek,

719
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:03,740
they can visit www.repa.net.

720
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,740
We are YPA.net.

721
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:11,740
And find the link for my podcast there.

722
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,740
Goodbye, Adam.

723
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,740
All right, buddy.

724
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,740
Thank you very much.

725
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,740
Patricia's Greek, part Greek.

726
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,740
Her mom is, her mom's side of the family is Greek.

727
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,740
And Christina also has a lot of that Greek blood running through her.

728
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:26,740
Hot tempered, I have to say, but love the Greek.

729
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,740
Oh yeah.

730
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,740
Okay.

731
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,740
By the way, although a really good idea,

732
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,740
I don't think it's a good idea to start altering ID three tags,

733
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:42,740
because that, for me, falls under the publishing of the,

734
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:47,740
excuse me, under the publishing and the copyright of the creator of that.

735
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:51,740
So that's probably not a very good idea, unless you, you know,

736
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,740
agree to it beforehand.

737
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:57,740
But for artists, yeah, that could be kind of cool to create a system

738
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,740
and dig up can completely do this.

739
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:05,740
And that's what I liked about your idea is not only on pod safe music,

740
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,740
but it could also be a part of the podcast,

741
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:12,740
where when you put your show up on the PDN,

742
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:15,740
we could make a space available for you to type in a message,

743
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,740
which would then be added in, and you could change that message.

744
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,740
So you could say, for every show that goes out for this week,

745
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,740
I want this message to scroll across an ID three tag,

746
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:29,740
and the description or whatever of the MP3 file.

747
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,740
We can totally do that.

748
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,740
So that seems like a great step for us to implement for podcasters.

749
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,740
I think it'll be very cool.

750
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:40,740
Now, the big problem is of course that ID three tags,

751
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,740
it's not consistent.

752
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:44,740
You have 15 million fucking different versions.

753
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:47,740
You know, Silicon Valley really fucked this stuff up.

754
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,740
The only thing that's good came out of Germany,

755
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,740
and that's the MP3 format,

756
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,740
because that's the only thing that's really pretty much consistent.

757
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,740
Everything else is so goddamn incompatible.

758
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,740
It really pisses me off that it works like that,

759
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,740
like that in computer land.

760
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,740
It's stupid.

761
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,740
Everyone trying to wall off everybody else.

762
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:06,740
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

763
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:10,740
Okay, let's wind it up with a song from the pod safe music network.

764
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,740
This is another recommendation from my favorite frogcaster,

765
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,740
Arnau Uber.

766
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,740
Adam's email,

767
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,740
I found a great talent on the PMN,

768
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,740
who just uploaded it to stuff,

769
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,740
Justin Winnerker.

770
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,740
So we're going to play Justin.

771
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,740
I just played him on my latest French language podcast,

772
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,740
De Genouille, don't, am I saying this right?

773
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:31,740
De Genouille, Genouille, don't le valet.

774
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:35,740
De Genouille, don la valet.

775
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,740
Bonjour, les bonjour Monsieur le professeur.

776
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,740
Great stuff, he's difficult to find as far as it's sound,

777
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,740
but who cares, it's great music.

778
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:47,740
Let's see, God, he wanted to hook up for a drink.

779
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,740
Shit, man, next time I'm out, we'll definitely do that.

780
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,740
And I really appreciate the recommendation.

781
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:55,740
There's nothing more fun than having someone give me an idea

782
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,740
of what to play instead of me having to choose

783
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,740
that every single day.

784
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,740
He's Justin Winnerker.

785
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:15,740
You would crawl at me and mother chance to be.

786
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:21,740
I love to know you're home.

787
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:25,740
I love to be the way I do now,

788
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,740
every single day of the week.

789
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,740
I'm happy to sleep around.

790
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:34,740
Up in shows, trips across the sea.

791
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:39,740
It's just go out with me.

792
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:44,740
If you're just go out with me.

793
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,740
If you're all kissing your lips,

794
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:56,740
I do just have a red rocket shot.

795
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,740
All for each day of the week.

796
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,740
We fly up to base on romantic,

797
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:08,740
we can dream, and we show you how good it is to be.

798
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:14,740
I love to know you're home.

799
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:18,740
I love to be the way I do now,

800
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,740
every single day of the week.

801
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,740
We're happy to sleep around.

802
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:27,740
Up in shows, trips across the sea.

803
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:32,740
Just go out with me.

804
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:35,740
Just go out with me.

805
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:39,740
If you're just go out with me,

806
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,740
I can fly around.

807
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,740
Justin Winnerker, just go out with me.

808
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,740
Two date songs in one charlie.

809
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,740
I mean, does it get any better than that?

810
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:54,740
The hell is this more to the song?

811
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,740
The kid made.

812
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,740
No.

813
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,740
What is that?

814
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,740
That's just like the band played on as the Titanic Cirque.

815
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,740
Just a two quick after thoughts here.

816
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:08,740
One is about to go daddy girl.

817
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:12,740
It just kind of hit me that Patricia might want to go daddy girl on her list.

818
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:16,740
And maybe what we should do is we should both just take Brad Pitt off our list.

819
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,740
Hmm.

820
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:22,740
Everybody had a great week.

821
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,740
Thank you very much for hanging out.

822
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,740
DailyStoresCode.com.

823
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:30,740
Adam at curie.com, although you may not be able to send me any email until I get back in the cottage

824
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,740
because Gmail is full once again.

825
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,740
Google, I will pay you.

826
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,740
