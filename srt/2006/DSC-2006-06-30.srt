00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,240
Adam Rodrigo, call you from SoHo, the hard of London.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,720
I don't know how you time it made, you went to the U.S., the weather turned cold,

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:39,120
20 sweaters last week, but now the weather's turned and I tell you, the boobs are out.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,520
The boobs are out, oh shit, the people look at me.

9
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,400
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass,

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,120
then the next generation radio content in my ears.

11
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,480
I like to think I'm flying into this show.

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,680
I'm just kidding, he's so angry.

13
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,280
That's right, it's special Friday edition of the Daily Source Code celebrating the beauty of women worldwide.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,840
Should back relax and enjoy.

15
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:04,040
I tell you, the whole me is still answering my emails to a last time to burn.

16
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:15,320
I tell you, the whole me and Queen, I'm begging you, I'm begging you, I want to be to I'm begging you.

17
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,560
Love is all I need and they will get me there.

18
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,200
Love is all of change and hope is shining.

19
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,400
Love is all I need and they will get me there.

20
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,880
Love is all change and hope is shining in my arms.

21
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,320
I hope is shining in my arms.

22
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:55,320
Love is all I need and hope is shining in my arms.

23
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:05,320
Love is all I need and hope is shining in my arms.

24
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:12,520
Love is all I need and they will get me there.

25
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:18,440
Love is all I need and hope is shining in my arms.

26
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,720
Love is all I need and they will get me there.

27
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,240
Love is all change and hope is shining in my arms.

28
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,240
There's all I need, and then go get me there

29
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:38,240
I'll be able to change him, hope is shining

30
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,240
Love is all I need, and then go get me there

31
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,240
I'll be able to change him, hope is shining

32
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:53,240
There's all I need, hope is shining

33
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,240
Love is all I need, hope is shining

34
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,240
Love is all I need, hope is shining

35
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,240
Love is all I need, hope is shining

36
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,240
To be around us, Esperanza, on the daily source code

37
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,240
It's right everybody, how you're doing

38
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,240
It's an all-female Friday on the Charlie Why?

39
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,240
Because it's my show, that's why

40
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,240
And you can hear the luxurious air conditioner

41
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,240
In the background here, and the curry cottage studios

42
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,240
And the affluent suburb of Surrey and Geilford

43
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,240
Better known as the fan

44
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
Where do you get it from?

45
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Tesco?

46
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Something like that?

47
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,240
Yeah, it's heating up

48
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,240
And I guess when it heats up, the host of your show heats up

49
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,240
And I was checking the podsafe music network this morning

50
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,240
As I always do, listen to all the new songs

51
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,240
I also have a look at the top ten played songs of yesterday

52
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,240
Of the week, today, and of the month

53
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
And it was just a whole bunch of women in there

54
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
Like, you know, and I just one song after

55
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
Now, they're not all as up tempo

56
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,240
As Esperanza, but how they're just beautiful

57
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
And, you know, there's not a woman in the world

58
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,240
That I can't find beauty in, I just love women

59
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,240
So, today the show is dedicated to all the women of the world

60
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,240
I almost want to break out moments in what knots with girls

61
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,240
But of course, that would be violating the rules

62
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,240
And I did it, yes, so they would Billy Preston

63
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
Man, you know, that's so messed up

64
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
That all this great music

65
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
That you'll just never hear on the radio again

66
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
It's going to just slowly fade away

67
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
And no one will ever hear about it

68
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
And it'll be gone, you know, we still listen to classical music

69
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,240
Two day, you know

70
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
And there's reasons for that

71
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,240
Two, 200 years after the fact even

72
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,240
There's, there's definite reasons for it

73
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,240
And it's, and it's not because

74
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,240
There was an RIA back then, you know what I mean?

75
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,240
So, we're just losing all that

76
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,240
So, it's going to be some different tunes on the show today

77
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,240
There's some stuff you definitely will never hear on the radio

78
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
But of course, all by beautiful women

79
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,240
Hey Adam, young from the Netherlands

80
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,240
I just want to let you know that I really really enjoy

81
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,240
Listening to your show

82
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
And there are two things

83
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
I had a nice day last night

84
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,240
And if I birded my non-year-old daughter set 10-0

85
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
But just a big laugh

86
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,240
And for the things, I really like the way you respond to

87
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,240
Some emails from myself

88
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
And give me a good feeling about it

89
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,240
That you really, really try to listen to your

90
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,240
Audience

91
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,240
Keep up the good work

92
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,240
Love hearing you

93
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
Yeah, thank you

94
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,240
Nice to meet you

95
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,240
Love hearing you, isn't that nice?

96
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,240
Young, dude, the audience is the show

97
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,240
It's like I just sit here and play stuff that you guys make

98
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
That's all I'm doing

99
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
And if it's not that, then it's the lady Patricia

100
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,240
So it's my job is relatively easy

101
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,240
I appreciate it

102
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,240
I need some good sensal verbs actually

103
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,240
I haven't been very gastronomic

104
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,240
Lately

105
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
So send them in

106
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
That's what those voice mail numbers are really for, you know?

107
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
I had them, this is Paul Smith

108
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,240
And the athlete went to suburb both, Gainesville, Florida

109
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Yeah

110
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,240
Hey, hopefully this is the right number

111
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,240
I've been listening to the Delta Sierra since the beginning

112
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,240
And you say those numbers

113
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,240
The column number is so fast

114
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
And I could ever write it down

115
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
But for some reason, drive it home for more

116
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
This afternoon, I caught it

117
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,240
So I just want to say hey, I love the music, I love the show

118
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,240
Hey, have a good one

119
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,240
You all man

120
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,240
Okay, so here we go

121
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
Get out your mobile phones

122
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,240
So you can program it and you only have to do it once

123
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
I'll do it real slow, you're right of course

124
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,240
I rattled those numbers off really quickly

125
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,240
Thinking that the disjocchi after me on the station will repeat it again

126
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
And eventually you'll get it

127
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,240
But of course, that's not the way it works in podcasting

128
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
So two numbers

129
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
You can choose one of the United States

130
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,240
Which may be cheaper for you or in London

131
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Which would be for just I guess the European number

132
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Let's call it that

133
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,240
So in New Jersey

134
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,240
And you want to do a plus on your mobile phone

135
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,240
Plus one

136
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,240
So if you move to a different area code

137
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,240
If you're in a different country, you can still call in

138
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
To the Charlie

139
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,240
Plus one

140
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
Two zero one

141
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,240
Six two five

142
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,240
Six three five seven

143
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,240
Or

144
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,240
If you're in London

145
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,240
Or any if you want to call the London number

146
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,240
Sorry, I'm gonna put it that way

147
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
Plus four four

148
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Two zero

149
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
Seven six

150
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,240
Eight one

151
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Three seven

152
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
Five three

153
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
You will not hear professional greeting

154
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
When you call this number

155
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
I can't figure out how to put a professional greeting in

156
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,240
Go Adam

157
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,240
Trucker Tom

158
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
Hey you

159
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
Thank you

160
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,240
You know we now have the

161
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,240
First family of pod

162
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,240
Your podcast thing

163
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
And

164
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
Christina's podcast thing

165
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,240
And of course Patricia is part of your podcast

166
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,240
So hey that means you're all gonna have to show up at the portable media expo

167
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,240
Towards the end of September

168
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
But before it's meeting

169
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,240
The rest of the first pod family

170
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,240
So

171
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,240
Keep up the great work

172
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,240
And of course you can find me at trucker tom. podshow.com

173
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,240
Right on Trucker Tom

174
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,240
Good to hear from you buddy

175
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
Yeah

176
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
You know, well first of all I would

177
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
Well, I think Christina's

178
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
School year will have already started

179
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
So that won't be possible

180
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
Which of course means one of the two parental units

181
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
Should probably stay home

182
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
So in this case that would be

183
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Patricia now I'm not planning on going this year to the portable media expo

184
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,240
And there's a couple of reasons for it

185
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,240
One is I want to try and keep my travel to

186
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,240
At a minimum and very flexible

187
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,240
Just for the family situation the second is

188
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,240
It's no fun for me

189
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,240
You know

190
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,240
Last year we went which was the first

191
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,240
PME and

192
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,240
And I was really looking forward to meeting a whole bunch of people

193
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
And what I thought would happen happened

194
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Which is you know I can't move three feet

195
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
Without people wanting to talk to me

196
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Which is cool

197
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,240
Only you can't really focus your attention on anyone person

198
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
Because then someone else comes in

199
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Someone else want to say something

200
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,240
And of course if you if you don't see someone

201
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Then they hate you forever

202
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
And it's you can't win

203
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
It's a lose lose situation

204
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
And so that's why we got a hotel suite

205
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,240
And just met people in there

206
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Or did a pool party

207
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,240
And did our own

208
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Unexpo if you will

209
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
And that of course pissed off

210
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,240
The organizers so I'm just going to stay away from it

211
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
We'll find plenty of other opportunities to hook up

212
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
And meet with each other

213
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Of course if you're ever in London or if you're ever in San Francisco

214
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,240
That makes it a whole lot easier

215
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,240
Just drop me a line

216
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,240
On this fabulous voice mail line

217
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Hey there Adam

218
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,240

Well rock on this is Nick from the Nick and Jane share

231
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240

232
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,240
I'm out

233
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
I'm out

234
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,240
Now that's the way to get a promo played on

235
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,240
Delta Sierra Charlie

236
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,240
You know if you want to get on the Chuck you just got a suck up

237
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
Suck up to the Chuck

238
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,240
Happy Friday Dear Charlie friends

239
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
Here's episode three

240
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,240
Of Ray on the Charlie

241
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,240
And I must say Adam

242
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,240
I really was bummed out by your story

243
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,240
And the Daily Source code 413

244
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,240
The story about your mother

245
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,240
And really got the tears in my eyes

246
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,240
Because

247
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,240
Well lately I've been thinking about it a lot

248
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,240
Both my parents are still alive

249
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,240
But I've seen the cancer catching both my grandmother's

250
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,240
The first one died in the 80s

251
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,240
And the other one died last year

252
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,240
Once he was 84 years old

253
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,240
The cancer catchers so fast

254
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,240
Since a while I've been thinking a lot about losing my parents

255
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
I don't know why but

256
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,240
Maybe it has something to do with my job as a police officer

257
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,240
And Amsterdam

258
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
I've seen so much and it was all so real

259
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,240
From naturally died until little children killed by the father

260
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,240
This week a 16 year old boy cut on well during the soccer game on the field

261
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240
We had to reanimate him

262
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,240
It was hard but in my life death is real

263
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,240
Recently I dreamt about losing my father

264
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,240
Last April he went 60

265
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,240
The dream was so real that I woke up with the tears in my eyes

266
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,240
And when I actually saw my father later that day

267
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,240
I was paying attention

268
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,240
Watching him thinking about my dream

269
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,240
I realized I really have to live and love him now

270
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,240
Because tomorrow could be too late

271
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,240
It really burned me out

272
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,240
I think it must be really hard losing a parent

273
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
Adam, static to mom

274
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
Take care

275
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
Bye

276
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,240
Hey Adam

277
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,240
This is a joke that goes up

278
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,240
From pod by radio

279
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,240
We've emailed in the past about our moms

280
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,240
Both having one cancer

281
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,240
And looking at your show man

282
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,240
I know exactly what you're going through

283
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,240
My mom actually passed away seven weeks ago

284
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,240
And it's tough I'm not going to bullshit you on that man

285
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,240
I think the second month is actually tougher

286
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
Because then you kind of realize that it's real

287
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,240
And I just got to the point yesterday

288
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,240
Where I deleted her number off my speed dial

289
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
I went cell phone

290
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,240
So in fact I could say the only regret I have

291
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,240
In this process was the fact that I didn't

292
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,240
Call her more and tell her I love her

293
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,240
And so if you get any bit of advice man

294
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,240
Just get on the phone and tell her you love her

295
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,240
I was trying to be stressed out working

296
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,240
I know how to call her tomorrow

297
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,240
And it's tough

298
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,240
And note you going through

299
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,240
And I listened to your show my way into work every morning

300
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,240
So I understand if you got to take a few days off

301
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,240
Or how many times much time you need to take off

302
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,240
Take it off

303
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,240
I'll be able to listen when you come back

304
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,240
So anyway, keep up the faith

305
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,240
And peace out

306
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
And you're at a prayer

307
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
Back

308
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,240
Oh dude, thank you you're in mind too

309
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,240
Yeah, that's

310
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,240
Isn't that funky?

311
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,240
This has happened to me over the past couple of years

312
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,240
I'd say the past three years for sure

313
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,240
Don't mean to bum me out though, by the way

314
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,240
On a female Friday

315
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,240
We'll get on with the festivities

316
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,240
But I've had this exact same situation

317
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,240
A couple of times where you keep seeing a person's name

318
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,240
In your telephone book

319
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,240
And you think in yourself

320
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,240
Is it time to delete it yet?

321
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
You know, it took me a long time

322
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
With the, for instance, Teo from Hoch

323
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
The Dutch filmmaker

324
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
Who was assassinated

325
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,240
In Amsterdam over a year ago

326
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,240
Because that was a guy

327
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,240
Who's phone was glued to his ear

328
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,240
In fact, they buried him with his mobile phone

329
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,240
And I did send him a text message

330
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,240
As they, after they had already buried him

331
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,240
It's, that is one of the weirdest things of modern life

332
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
Isn't it?

333
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
Well, you just, you know, it used to be

334
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,240
You read the obituaries

335
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
And you'd be looking for names that you recognize

336
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
And now it's, you know, you're looking at your mobile phone

337
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,240
And thinking

338
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,240
It's maybe time to get rid of that one or not

339
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
Okay

340
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,240
Here's one of those songs I found this morning

341
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,240
That just blew me away

342
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Well, it's a Forbes

343
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
She's from Down Under

344
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
No more Mondays

345
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,240
Yet all the eyes shared

346
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
A little pile, a little note

347
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,240
I know, phrase by phrase

348
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,240
I spun gold of your melodies

349
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,240
The sadness of your ways

350
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,240
You're holding out

351
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,240
You're holding in your car

352
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,240
Go home again

353
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,240
You've got broken wings

354
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,240
Hey

355
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,240
Whew

356
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Says a la�aист

357
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,240
word yet a nation of one

358
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,240
Suddenly you're trowing

359
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,240
Your loving your life

360
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,240
You cheap, you built a peep

361
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
At the hands of them

362
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,240
But of course, you want your own where its gonna be

363
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
No just someone

364
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
Did you dare do you?

365
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,240
Every desire while inspired

366
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,540
Sty your mixed upish defotion to the notions

367
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:46,240
Of truth and put in your hold of love

368
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,240
Your holding, you can't go home again

369
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,240
You've got broken wings

370
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,240
You've got broken wings

371
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,240
You've got broken wings

372
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,240
You've got broken wings

373
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,240
You've got broken wings

374
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,240
You've got broken wings

375
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,240
You've got broken wings

376
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,240
You've got broken wings

377
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,240
You've got broken wings

378
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,240
You've got broken wings

379
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,240
You've got broken wings

380
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,240
You've got broken wings

381
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,240
You've got broken wings

382
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,240
You've got broken wings

383
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,240
You've got broken wings

384
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,240
you're home to me

385
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,240
you're not going

386
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,240
you've got broken

387
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
Melissa Forbes

388
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
that's right

389
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,240
can play chart day

390
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
can play chakra

391
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,240
can play

392
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,240
dinecral

393
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
can play

394
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,240
Melissa Forbes

395
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
because she's podsafe

396
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,240
my mistake

397
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
was a broken wings

398
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,240
of course

399
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,240
broken wings for chat

400
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,240
the title of that one

401
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,240
she's there for most

402
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,240
of best female solo artist

403
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,240
at the 2006 International

404
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,240
online music awards

405
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
very cool

406
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,240
and of course

407
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,240
she's beautiful

408
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,240
they're all beautiful

409
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
every single one of them

410
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,240
every single one

411
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,240
hi Adam it's Matt here

412
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,240
just been listening to some of your old

413
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,240
shows and I heard you talking about

414
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,240
emo

415
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,240
I thought Rod Hall was dead

416
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,240
that's a joke for your British

417
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,240
listeners by the way

418
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,240
also you're talking about

419
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,240
the World Cup coverage

420
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,240
and I think we're all getting the same

421
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,240
German's feed

422
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,240
it looks like it's being filmed

423
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,240
in a block of council flats

424
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
about two miles away

425
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,240
but apparently this is being done

426
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
for those five people who've got

427
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
HD TV at the moment

428
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
so

429
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,240
good job they're thinking of the masses

430
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,240
on a more serious note

431
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,240
I've just got one more thing

432
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,240
to say

433
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,240
come on in

434
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
come on in

435
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
you're so right

436
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
and even the US coverage

437
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,240
is touting all this HD HD

438
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,240
now it's like please

439
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,240
I don't have HD

440
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,240
I don't want to go

441
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,240
oh wow the pod father doesn't have HD

442
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
I really don't care

443
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,240
I really don't

444
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,240
yeah we're going to get to that point

445
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
and this is okay here's a prediction

446
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,240
ready here's where it's going to go

447
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,240
television will become

448
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,240
just a

449
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,240
it's will not just but it will become a

450
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,240
very

451
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,240
beautiful experience

452
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,240
in your home

453
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,240
when we all can afford

454
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,240
these huge

455
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,240
beautiful flat screens that

456
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
will become art

457
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
not just a big

458
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
ten thousand dollar

459
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
thing that's hanging

460
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
on your wall

461
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
on some ugly ass

462
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,240
bracket

463
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
but something that's beautifully

464
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,240
integrated

465
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,240
and

466
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
we'll get beyond even

467
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
the HD

468
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,240
who knows we'll get into

469
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
more dimensions

470
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,240
but

471
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,240
what you're going to watch on that

472
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,240
is of course primarily

473
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,240
movies

474
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
because that's what everyone is watching

475
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,240
now at home

476
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
we're not going to the theater

477
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,240
as much as we are

478
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,240
I was thinking about all this

479
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,240
thing

480
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,240
Mark Cuban is on to something

481
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,240
the idea of setting up an HD

482
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,240
movie company

483
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,240
which is his entire

484
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,240
his entire drive

485
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
I think is a fantastic idea

486
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,240
I don't really know if I

487
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,240
think

488
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,240
trying to open up a high

489
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,240
definition digital

490
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,240
theaters is the way to go

491
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
but getting into the

492
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,240
business of creating

493
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
high definition content

494
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,240
is definitely

495
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
it's a very expensive route

496
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,240
to go and it's not something

497
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,240
that I'm going to get into

498
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,240
at least not today

499
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,240
but

500
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
I think it is the way to go

501
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,240
people will want to see movies

502
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,240
that we're building our own

503
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,240
movie theaters

504
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,240
and of course sports

505
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,240
go right along with that

506
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,240
we may have to have

507
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,240
multiple televisions

508
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,240
to get the full experience

509
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
but that I think is where

510
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
television is going

511
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
and

512
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
for right now you're right

513
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,240
they're totally

514
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
jumping the shark by

515
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
giving these big

516
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,240
great wide shots

517
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
where if you're on a

518
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
standard

519
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,240
television you're like huh

520
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,240
well I can't I can't

521
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,240
really see it

522
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,240
I can't

523
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,240
and of course

524
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
I think you need some

525
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,240
flashier television

526
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
directors in there

527
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,240
you know

528
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
the guys who are doing the

529
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
world cup I have to agree

530
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
it kind of looks like

531
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
the television song

532
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
contest just

533
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
dreary and

534
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,240
boring

535
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,240
give us some close-ups

536
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,240
you know let's see

537
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
something going when you see

538
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
the slow-motion you see

539
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
the stuff these guys are

540
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,240
doing with the ball

541
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,240
and their feet

542
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,240
it's unbelievable

543
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,240
and

544
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,240
rightly said

545
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,240
going land

546
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
sorry

547
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,240
not connected having

548
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,240
trouble staying connected

549
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,240
the

550
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,240
problem

551
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,240
is not that

552
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,240
enough

553
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,240
so it's

554
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,240
something

555
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,240
more satisfying

556
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,240
action

557
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,240
I mean

558
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,240
internet you pervert

559
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
earthling

560
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,240
again

561
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,240
turn on

562
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
stay connected

563
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240

ad challenge

565
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
drawing to a close

566
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,240
this is just another one

567
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,240
of the of the

568
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
entries you're hearing it all

569
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
over the pod show podcast network

570
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
of course

571
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,240
and

572
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,240
in our final round

573
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,240
I believe

574
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,240
we're actually rolling out a whole bunch

575
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,240
of them

576
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,240
people will be played on podcast

577
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
they're going to get compensated

578
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,240
for huge prize money available

everything you need to know

to enter

584
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
and hopefully

585
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,240
to win

586
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,240
I had him this is

587
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,240
Charles from London

588
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,240
glorious sunny London

589
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
I've just been listening to

590
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,240
your podcast we played

591
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,240
the inline

592
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,240
to die

593
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,240
track

594
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,240
I actually haven't finished listening

595
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,240
to track

596
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,240
I just

597
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,240
do

598
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,240
the guy

599
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
you are

600
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,240
sorry

601
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,240
the

602
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,240
podcast

603
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
no

604
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,240
it

605
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,240
I got another comment

606
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,240
about the title of that show

607
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
I had him

608
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,240
it's Brian and I'd like to offer a tip

609
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,240
to listeners who are interested in getting

610
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,240
into pod casting

611
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,240
of course

612
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,240
are going to go over to go to adding

613
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,240
get the domain name

614
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
but when they do that

615
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,240
I learned something

616
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
and I'd like to pass this along

617
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,240
it's probably a good idea to find a name

618
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
that people can spell

619
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,240
and probably more importantly

620
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,240
a name they can pronounce

621
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,240
hey this is Jeremy Rowan

622
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,240
you are listening to

623
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,240
the proof of crack

624
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,240
let's a brown

625
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,240
thank you

626
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,240
you're much Brian from the

627
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,240
broadcast across the cast

628
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,240
we're turning me on

629
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,240
to that

630
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,240
I practiced that shit

631
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,240
too

632
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,240
hey this is Jeremy Rowan

633
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,240
you are listening to

634
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
crack

635
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,240
see

636
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,240
that's the problem

637
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,240
okay let's do it

638
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,240
you need something

639
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,240
a little more spicy

640
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,240
it's fucking hard to say

641
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,240
that I had to think

642
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,240
really hard

643
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
and I don't know

644
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,240
musicians I suppose to be able

645
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,240
to have to do that

646
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,240
yeah so there you have it

647
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,240
Adam

648
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,240
Robin seem pretty clear

649
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
but fortunately

650
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,240
the solution was simple

651
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,240
grab my favorite

652
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,240

653
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,240
from the daily source code

654
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
went over to godaddy.com

655
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,240
and got this

656
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,240

659
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
that is a better

660
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
better ring to it

661
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
or maybe just a little bit easier

662
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,240
to say

663
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,240
I don't sound like

664
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,240
Jimmy from South Park trying to say

665
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,240

of the charlie including

682
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,240
July 4th

683
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,240

684
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,240
bout you'll hear me

685
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,240
see you then

686
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,240
let's continue with

687
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,240
with the other person

688
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,240
who has some problem with

689
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,240
ruper

690
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,240
audioaditude dot com

691
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,240
we've had a plan going on

692
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,240
you know that the plan

693
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,240
had an instrument to move

694
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,240
I just got out of the

695
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,240
two states i hear the

696
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
plane going overhead

697
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,240
man on the

698
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,240
looking around the thinking

699
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,240
how far is that

700
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:14,040
do the intro. So yeah that was one thing. The other thing football soccer in the UK is

701
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,120
a massive culture around it. Like you say because it's something anyone can do anywhere.

702
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:24,200
I mean we have a saying here that was coined by a fast show. Jumpers for goal posts. Now that

703
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,600
just basically is talking about boys finishing school, taking their school jumpers off

704
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,680
and having a knock around in the park. You know a little kick about. It's something that

705
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,920
anyone can do anyway. You can do it in the office. You can do it in the bathroom. You know

706
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:43,000
whatever. That's I think why it's so popular. It's accessible to everybody.

707
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,280
Much like forecasting. It's something that anyone can do

708
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:56,120
given very minimal equipment. I'm a listener. So I kind of think I could start a podcast

709
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,560
and unless I'm going to keep adding to it and keep working at it. There's no point in

710
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:07,560
it would just be a disservice to my listeners. That's it really is what I would say.

711
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,400
You got good work. Love it all spike. You know that's kind of the beauty of this all is you could

712
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:17,000
man my damn fun. You can you can just listen to this stuff and enjoy it. You don't have to

713
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,600
participate as a as a podcast. In fact you just did you call the voice mail line. That's

714
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,960
that's all I'm looking for. Thank you very much. Yeah. But of course if you do want to get into

715
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:34,440
it it's relatively easy. Hi Adam. This is Elvis from the Elvis Kennedy podcast. I'm speaking to you

716
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:43,000
as I ride my bike down a beautiful country lane here in Wisconsin. No, not a bike like the

717
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,920
Harley-U just heard go by a bicycle. With a tour to front starting this Saturday, I thought your

718
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,240
listeners might like to know that I'm doing a mini tour to France whereby I ride half the actual

719
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,280
tour miles each day. This works out to be almost 55 miles a day for the next three weeks.

720
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,440
Anyway, I'll also be doing a couple of podcastering the tour and it should be interesting to see just

721
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:10,200
what goes on in the lonely mind of a long distance cyclist. You can check them out at ElvisCennity.com.

722
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,760
And one more thing Adam, I too am a private pilot. So I feel very comfortable signing off by saying

723
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,560
tailwinds. But I can tell you that while headwinds and tailwinds are very important when you're

724
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:27,400
out flying, they can also make a break of bike ride. Riding with a strong tailwind is one of

725
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:33,640
life's pure pleasures. Conversely, peddling into a 30 mile an hour ahead of wind for a few hours

726
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,280
is just plain brutal. So I really do mean it when I say tailwinds, Adam.

727
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,360
It's starting Saturday already. I had no idea. There's so much going on. Two of the fronts.

728
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,760
I guess Lance Armstrong isn't competing. That's why we haven't heard about it. Or is he? I don't

729
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:59,160
even know. I'm so thoroughly engrossed in the world cup. So tomorrow, of course, England plays

730
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:05,080
Portugal. It's going to be a good match. I tell you. Those, I mean, the Portuguese kids. Woo!

731
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,320
They're tough. As we, as we witnessed when they played the Netherlands. But of course, we've got

732
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,560
we've got our boys. And now I can safely say our boys because I only have one team left that I really

733
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:21,960
want to root for since the Netherlands has been ejected. And the USA is also out of the competition.

734
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:29,400
It's going, England all the way. Adam Chris Goprin from the carcass.com. And today is the

735
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:36,280
one year anniversary of podcasting on iTunes. And as such, they placed a, you know, greatest hits

736
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:41,480
kind of thing on the iTunes music store page. And the one thing was up there that I didn't see,

737
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,480
kind of frustrated about this. I didn't see the daily source code. You know, in their top like 50

738
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,400
podcasts, celebrating the one year anniversary. And I just wanted to say, what a bunch of freaking

739
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,840
losers. Come on. Where's the code? Where's the Charlie? How great day.

740
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,280
Yeah, now I'm going to have a really good day. Yeah, man, that's show business. That's how it goes.

741
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,960
You don't think it would be related at all to me talking about their product. Would it?

742
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:14,520
But yep, that's how it goes. As I said, that's show business. And show business will continue

743
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:22,920
liberating your media and mine. This is for all you listeners out there next week. And I think

744
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,160
you've had enough clues as to what when it's going to take place. We'll be opening up pod

745
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:35,960
show plus for any listener, anywhere worldwide, giving you even better ways to listen, to collect,

746
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:44,360
to organize, to share, to interact with podcasts and the audio podcasts, video podcasts,

747
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:50,120
podsafe music, we're really starting to tie it all together. We've been ball to the wall all week

748
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,000
long. The team in San Francisco actually around the world. We have people around the world helping

749
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,720
us out on this developers who don't live necessarily near the company. We've got audio people

750
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:07,480
all over the world. A P-dub, of course, in Florida. And everyone is really, you know, if they're

751
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,760
not working directly on the product, they're picking up the slack somewhere else. And it's, uh,

752
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,960
and I really do appreciate it. And we've been doing reviews and and just going over the stuff and

753
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:21,640
over and over and over again. And of course, you keep running into all kinds of bugs and inconsistencies

754
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,640
and stuff that isn't the way we'd like to see it, or that maybe it's just plain wrong. And there's

755
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,840
also moments of beauty where things pop up that are just so unexpected. And we have hundreds of

756
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:37,240
data testers in now and we're learning a tremendous amount about what it should be. But I just

757
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,400
want you to remember that PodShow is an audience facing company. We're about you, we're about

758
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:48,360
you, the listener, and we hope to make it better for you. So that you can also just say to a friend

759
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,400
of yours, hey, you know, you want to try a podcast thing, then why don't you go to PodShow.com. Now

760
00:30:53,400 --> 00:31:00,280
you can sign up early. You'll have your own identity. So if you want to choose that now, just go to PodShow.com,

761
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:06,040
it's really simple. Click on the on the logo and you can pre-register. You'll also be able to

762
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:12,360
home and it's going to be so awesome. You'll be able to create URLs for your own podcast. If

763
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:18,600
you so wish, of course, cast blaster is completely hooked up and tied in into the podcast delivery

764
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,720
network. But I think you're really going to enjoy it. And if there are things you think that'll

765
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,160
need to be better, let us know. We are just about on the cost of releasing this stuff and I'm pretty sure

766
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,680
that we'll be working throughout the weekend. Hey Adam, it's Carl again. Just listening to the latest

767
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:40,120
channel you are cooking dinner. And you said that you had a short of your voice more questions.

768
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:45,880
Well, I've got two for you and they're both about cast blaster. I'm still doing some more computer

769
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:53,160
and I don't know if there did something to my sound and everything just sounds so much clear

770
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:59,080
and I don't know. Does it have some sort of equalises settings or does it do anything or is it

771
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:07,240
dismayed? But everything seems to sound a lot more clear. And my second question is, if I purchase

772
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:15,000
a license for cast blaster at the moment, when the new version comes out, because it's an

773
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:24,840
basis, will the license work with all the versions that we'll be coming out? I think you have to

774
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,920
and keep up the good luck. Thanks. Bye. Yo. Well, let me answer those questions for you.

775
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,760
First of all, I had no idea what you're talking about with the sound. If all of a sudden it's

776
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,560
started to sound better, then I would send an email to Mike at castblaster.com and thank you for it,

777
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:45,400
because he does have some incredible magic going on. And it's been well over a year that this program

778
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:51,800
has been in development. It's been in development in conjunction with podcasters. I wasn't using it

779
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:58,040
for the longest time until I made my switch. Actually, I bought a, uh, the tissue by bought specifically

780
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:03,880
to run castblaster because I was so frustrated with my Mac. Just, you know, all kinds of issues. And

781
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:09,960
I really, I'm an audio visual guy. It's like I kind of got a Mac, you know. So, um, it's been

782
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:16,760
and improved and version upon version just with new bug fixes. Just yesterday, uh, Mike gave me a

783
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:22,040
version that has an HTML editor now, a built into the show notes, which is freaking awesome. So,

784
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:28,200
now I really, I can cut down another 10 minutes from my entire process. Now it's almost a one button

785
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,520
and go. I mean, I, it automatically goes to curie.com. I still have to do that radio,

786
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:38,680
usual and stupid thing, uh, which of course, um, will be changing as well. You don't have to do anything

787
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:43,000
right now as, as a listener, just sit tight. You'll be cool. Or just go into podshow plus and

788
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,640
get my show. That's right. Get it. Don't subscribe. Please. Just get it.

789
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:57,080
Why in the now, parah, all female Friday, um, see, we've been to Australia with, uh,

790
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:03,960
oh, second, let me check. Australia with Melissa Forbes, the fear, I'm also where she from,

791
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:12,680
actually. She's from New York. I love seeing all these pictures. I love the ladies. That's right.

792
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:21,240
And my name is Leroy. This is, uh, Rebecca Havilland also from New York.

793
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:30,280
You'll love her voice, man. She plays, she writes, she sings, and she's podsafe. I found you.

794
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:56,200
At all of this pain, but when you found me that night, and you held me tight,

795
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,920
I knew I'd never run from love again.

796
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:20,120
I've been down this road, one, two, many times, and each day it just feels like a blind

797
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:33,800
in the blind. But you had the same. I've been searching for all my life, and I'll never

798
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:48,360
stumble again, because when I didn't think that I would ever find love again,

799
00:35:48,360 --> 00:36:05,000
or I found you. Oh, yes, I did. And when I didn't think that I would ever find love again,

800
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:24,200
or I found you. Oh, yes, I did. I found you. You held me here when I was weary,

801
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:36,280
and you held me down when I was afraid to jump. Get us to push you away,

802
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:47,000
only because I was afraid of losing the game once again.

803
00:36:47,320 --> 00:37:01,800
Oh, I didn't realize all the cool things I had until I didn't have it.

804
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:18,600
Oh, no, no, no, so won't you accept my plea and come back to me. And I'll stay right here

805
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:36,040
to you. Because when I didn't think that I would ever find love again, I found you. Oh, yes, I did.

806
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:58,440
And when I didn't think that I would ever find love again, or I found you. Oh, yes, I did. I found you.

807
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:05,400
We're back, I have a learned. I found you on the pod safe and music network. That's exactly

808
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,760
where I found you. Wrapping up the all-female Friday on the Daily Source Code. Have yourself a great

809
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:25,160
weekend, everybody. I'll see you on Monday. Get this podcast and more great ones like you.
