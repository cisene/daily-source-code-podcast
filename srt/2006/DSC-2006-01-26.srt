1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 3-2

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,560
$16 million worth of airplane strapped my ass

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,400
in the next generation radio content in my ears

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,680
I like to think I'm flying into this journey

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,520
I'm just kidding

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,880
It's so curry

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,680
Coming to you from the sunny suburbs of Surrey

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,080
It is the daily source code from the Curry County

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,800
I can't think of nothing worse

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,800
When it's almost back all the time

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,440
I love the scriptboard

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,040
I love it

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,400
Too long too fine too fine

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,400
You can't come party with him

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Friends around someone else

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,440
That's your way

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,920
It's someone living here

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,240
Everywhere you look Allah keeps me

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,680
When you're back

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,040
You've been wasting all your time

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,880
Yea that's the day

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,440
And I'm sure one of the girls don't want

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,480
One leg and one leg and one leg

24
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,880
You're the very star of the body

25
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,880
It's a baby to the sunset

26
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,880
And I'm sure one leg and one leg

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,880
And I'm sure one leg and one leg

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,880
You're the very star of the body

29
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,880
It's a baby to the sunset

30
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,880
And I'm sure one leg and one leg

31
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,880
You're the very star of the body

32
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,880
And I'm sure one leg and one leg

33
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,880
You're the very star of the soul

34
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,880
And I'm sure one leg and one leg

35
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:36,880
You're the very star of the soul

36
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,880
And I'm sure one leg and one leg

37
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,160
There you are, you are the Ferris of the Mall.

38
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,720
It's criminal from San Francisco, kicking off Thursdays

39
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,720
edition of the Daily Source Code.

40
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,640
Hey everybody, how you doing?

41
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,840
Everything here is good.

42
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,840
Sad news.

43
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,960
Yesterday that reached me after I'd already done the show

44
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,600
about to the passing of Chris Penn.

45
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,320
And it really sucks when someone from your own generation

46
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,720
goes, first of all, it makes you more aware of your own mortality

47
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,080
and all that typical crap.

48
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,760
What is this hissing sound of here?

49
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,760
What is that?

50
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,320
Whatever.

51
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:21,960
I know all three Penn Brothers, I've met them all on the same occasion.

52
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,200
Michael Penn, I met at MTV when he first came out with his,

53
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
I guess it was his first album.

54
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,760
And both Sean and Chris, I met on the funny,

55
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,600
we were on an airplane together.

56
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,880
They used to be the service between New York and Los Angeles

57
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,000
called, oh man, shoot.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,320
Now I forget the name of it.

59
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,000
It was like the golden something.

60
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,080
God, now I can't remember.

61
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,280
Anyway, it was an exclusive airline.

62
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,560
And it cost like, you know, 50% more than regular first class ticket.

63
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,960
Or maybe not that much more, but I did cost a little bit more.

64
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,360
I wish I could remember the name of it.

65
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,560
And basically they had, I think it was 737s.

66
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,280
And they could only take 25 passengers,

67
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,720
or some ridiculous amount like that.

68
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,480
Maybe it was 35 passengers.

69
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,880
And they had a bar and it was really chic, you know,

70
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,480
I'd had, you know, it had state rooms.

71
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,480
We could sit two and two across from each other with a table

72
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,240
that would come up from the floor.

73
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,480
And you could, you know, you would have your meals served there very

74
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,320
much like the Oriental Express.

75
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,720
I remember actually going to the bathroom the first time.

76
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,040
And I thought I'd walked into a wrong room.

77
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,760
It was so huge, just unbelievable.

78
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,320
And so one time I was traveling to Los Angeles.

79
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,000
And this is MTV days.

80
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,680
And across from me, and next to me were Chris Penn, Sean Penn,

81
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,480
and their mom, I think her name is, I want to say,

82
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,080
I lean, I think.

83
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,840
And so there you are, you know, you're going to sit there for six hours.

84
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,640
And we all knew kind of who we were.

85
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,240
And so obviously conversation did start.

86
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,880
But not after Chris had taken off his T-shirt

87
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,960
and he was basically drinking beer from a can with no shirt

88
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,480
on it.

89
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,800
I think he had shoes on.

90
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,560
But they were delightful, both of those guys.

91
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,520
And this was actually not long after Sean Penn,

92
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,480
had, I don't know if they were just separated

93
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,480
or the divorce from Madonna.

94
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,880
And, you know, of course, during a six hour flight,

95
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,080
there's a lot to talk about.

96
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,440
And, you know, I said, you know, we'll do.

97
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,480
So I hope everything's okay with the personal situation.

98
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:33,000
How uh, how that going, he said, dude,

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
hell, half no fury with that bitch.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,880
And, uh, so it was nice.

101
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,880
It was nice meeting those guys.

102
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,280
And it's sad that Chris has passed.

103
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,320
I think it might be alcohol-related,

104
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,280
maybe just overused his body a bit,

105
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,760
but nonetheless sad, it's like fucking my age.

106
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,880
Um, very exciting this morning.

107
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,120
Um, I uh, I was able to import my entire podcast subscription list

108
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,200
from my iTunes right into my pod show,

109
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,240
which is, I've told you about this yesterday.

110
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
This is this whole, you know, listening interface

111
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,320
where you can become, you know, a registered listener

112
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,040
of a podcast, uh, it handles all of your,

113
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,360
um, all of your subscriptions, you know,

114
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,800
neatly manages it, um, you can share stuff with each other.

115
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,880
And what's nice about this is so basically, you know,

116
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,480
from iTunes, you just say, you know, okay,

117
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,880
it's export my entire subscription list.

118
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,200
Uh, you, you, uh, you know,

119
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,440
click that into my pod show.

120
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,440
And all of your subscriptions then appear there.

121
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,240
Do you hear that?

122
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,080
That's the, oh, it's the window cleaner.

123
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,840
How you doing?

124
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
Uh, it's not listening.

125
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,360
All right.

126
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,080
Um, so you import all of those, um,

127
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,840
and they, they show up in a playlist.

128
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,160
Now what's nice about it is you can then choose

129
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,320
windows media player, real of this.

130
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,560
Of course, an XML icon or you just click on,

131
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,080
and here's the, this is the cool thing.

132
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,160
You just click on the iTunes logo.

133
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,680
And then it subscribes you, but only to one feed.

134
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,240
So all your podcasts show up in one feed.

135
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,960
And what's great about this is anything you change.

136
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,520
You, you can subscribe to this feed, you know,

137
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,160
through any podcasting device, basically.

138
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,160
Uh, so you could have, you know,

139
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,200
subscribe that home.

140
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,960
You could have a version subscribed, uh,

141
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,640
you could have it subscribed at the office.

142
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,040
And you change everything just from, uh,

143
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,160
in any web browser.

144
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,560
That's where you can add and delete subscriptions,

145
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,440
or, you know, as we say, get a show or I already got a show.

146
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,880
It's much simpler language.

147
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,600
Um, and when you change it on the website,

148
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,640
which you can do from anywhere,

149
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,480
it changes across all of the machines that,

150
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,640
that are subscribed to that one single feed.

151
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,800
And you can have multiple feeds, you know,

152
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,640
by basically creating a new playlist.

153
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,360
So you might want to have a different set of shows that download at work.

154
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,080
Um, as to, as opposed to what you have at home.

155
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,040
It's really cool.

156
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,480
Uh, I'm totally digging this.

157
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,600
You can rearrange, uh, the order, uh,

158
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,080
you can create new playlists and sub playlists.

159
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,280
Just shit, just keeps on going.

160
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,800
It's really, really cool.

161
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,200
I think that this is the first time I've seen something focused

162
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,560
on the listener and really the listening side of the equation that is,

163
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,760
that's gotten me excited.

164
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,640
And that this, of course, is me and, uh, in listener mode.

165
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,480
Yo, Adam, trucker Tom here with an epiphany.

166
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,880
I had regarding the pod save music network.

167
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,200
Why not set it up so that everyone participating on the network

168
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,560
could leave identifying tags for pieces of music,

169
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,600
similar to the way you can leave tags on flinger photos.

170
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,840
And then make the tag searchable.

171
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,880
Then I could search for terms such as kicks ass or mellow

172
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,240
to find the songs other PMN users had left.

173
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,520
It would add yet another great way for everyone to find the music that we're looking for.

174
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,640
You can find links to everything I'm involved in at truckerfoto.com.

175
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,160
See ya.

176
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,840
Right on, trucker Tom.

177
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,280
Uh-huh.

178
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,840
We rough on my ass there, TT.

179
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,320
Um, you know, absolutely.

180
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,880
That is, um, and I know, no Georgia scientist is listening and he's probably smiling.

181
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,880
Of course, it makes so much sense where you can tag content.

182
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,760
Wouldn't that be awesome if it would be, you know, if you're able to tag a song from the

183
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:19,000
pod save music network or, um, tag, uh, geez, I don't know, a picture or whatever.

184
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,920
And then those tags would carry through.

185
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,120
So if there was an enhanced podcast file, the tags would still be intact.

186
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,600
Of the pictures used in it and the music used in it.

187
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,400
Mm-hmm.

188
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,200
I don't think there's technological barriers.

189
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,040
I think that what we're doing is the right thing, man.

190
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,760
We're just sitting here dreaming about this shit, totally digging it.

191
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,640
Um, for the past, what is it now?

192
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,440
Almost two weeks we've been announcing a new podcast members who were joining the podcast, uh,

193
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,320
the pod show podcast family and today is no exception.

194
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,840
I don't want any coffee.

195
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,160
Quit your day job stuff is really cool, but you know what?

196
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,640
I really don't have a day job to quit.

197
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,320
Just remember, I'm Jade Ollie.

198
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:21,560
I'm not shadow steel and we do crap in kudos, celebrity interviews, pod save music,

199
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,640
and we do stuff like, uh, like this.

200
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,280
I remember your time.

201
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
Oh, man, I'm nice cup of sense out.

202
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,520
Crap, wrong promo.

203
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,920
This, you know, when I was a young boy, they told me not to quit my day job,

204
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,840
because my shit ain't shut.

205
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,040
Well, you know what?

206
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,680
I'm a podcaster now, and because you've had a curry and pod casting,

207
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,440
I can quit my day job.

208
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,800
You can quit your day job.

209
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,080
I can quit my job.

210
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,280
You, why did you?

211
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,440
You, why did you?

212
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,040
You, why did you?

213
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,840
This is TV, slip, shit, you know what?

214
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,120
Oh, quit your day job, mother.

215
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,320
In celebration of being a new family member to Pot Show,

216
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,320
I thought I'd write a new music jingle, so, um, uh, here it is.

217
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,920
The Bad Fathers, the Bad Fathers,

218
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,960
walking down the street on a foggy night, wearing sunglasses,

219
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:31,560
being my partner, Joe Monday, on hunt pursuit of a guy called,

220
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,840
The pod father, the pod father,

221
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,080
keep your eye on PotShow.com because pretty soon,

222
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,360
gonna help you to all that, and I think, uh,

223
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,920
once we get to our podcasters up and rolling,

224
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,320
and there's a shitloader that will be bandwidth,

225
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,600
and y'all kinds of support, and that works support,

226
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,920
if you will, uh, then we're gonna go after you.

227
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,200
We're coming to get you 100 million listeners.

228
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,840
Yeah.

229
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm Jade Donley, madpod.com.

230
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,120
Thank you for inviting me.

231
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,800
I had no brother love.

232
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
Yo, JD, thanks, man. I love it.

233
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,440
Hopefully you'll send me that as a separate file,

234
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,440
so I can use that on the show once in a while.

235
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,600
And you know what, you too soon, we'll be able to talk about

236
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,680
Acqueview and the sponsorship of Heather and Janelle.

237
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,280
Download.acqueview.com.

238
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,720
So that was the window washer.

239
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,640
I thought it was the, um, I thought it was the, uh,

240
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,320
the radiators that just need some of the air needs to be let out.

241
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,560
And I turned around, there was a guy staring right back at me.

242
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,360
It's kind of weird.

243
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,000
And he was listening to me because the windows open is head was right by the window.

244
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,360
I don't know what he was thinking.

245
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,640
Well, maybe it's just thinking him out.

246
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,800
You know, I'm just cleaning the pod father's windows and it was so.

247
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,960
So, um, yeah, I met JD and in person, um, when I was in San Francisco last time.

248
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,480
Very smart.

249
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,040
Lots of the cool production ideas and always walking around with a recorder.

250
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,200
Nice to see the dig.com is picked up on the ample ignoring or,

251
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,000
at least not being very communicative about the, uh, sound issue on the new

252
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,040
power books, which is affected my show severely, um, and is affecting apparently lots of

253
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,840
people who are professional, um, users of sound applications.

254
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,200
Let's, let's just put it that way.

255
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,960
And, uh, I'm sure that it'll get fixed and it'll get resolved.

256
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:35,080
Somehow I have a very nasty feeling that it's a hardware issue and that it's going to have to be fixed

257
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,240
at the hardware level, which means, you know, everyone taking their, their machines back to the

258
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,480
shop, not an option I'm looking forward to.

259
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,120
But that's kind of what it feels like to me, um, you know, so maybe there's something that can be

260
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,400
done with a firmware, but it couldn't, you know, these are new machines.

261
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,440
This is new hardware.

262
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,040
So that's where I'd look for the bugs first because it didn't have this on the previous power book.

263
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,840
A power book defect dot info is where you can sign up if you're having the same

264
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,040
problems everybody else is having.

265
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,880
We just want a little bit of attention, I guess.

266
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:07,400
It makes no sense to me that Apple just doesn't say it's one simple paragraph, you know,

267
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,200
hey, dudes and dudeettes, we hear you.

268
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,240
We're working on the problem, looking into it.

269
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,280
That would shut everybody and everything will be quiet.

270
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,160
You know, we'd wait.

271
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,200
Oh, wait, no problem.

272
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,280
Just let me know.

273
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,720
I know it's not in the DNA of the company, but it's so like

274
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,800
1980s to do it that way.

275
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,360
Here, here's how a technology company operates in 2006.

276
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,960
Email from Ed Truji, oh, now I'm buttering this.

277
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,560
Let me see Ed Trujilo, I'll go with Trujilo.

278
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,840
Ed, hey, my, my name is Ed Trujilo.

279
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:49,080
I'm the president and author of the programs at www.contactplus.com.

280
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,400
One of your loyal listeners suggested that we send you a free copy of the Countdown

281
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,160
Clock and I agree, please enjoy.

282
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,040
And how cool is that?

283
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,720
Only yesterday, the day before I was talking about this, this wonderful

284
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,360
piece of software called Countdown Clock, which does exactly what I want it to do.

285
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,960
Nothing more, nothing less.

286
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,400
You can set the time to start.

287
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,440
It counts down 10 seconds before it hits zero.

288
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,400
It starts flashing out.

289
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,280
You get your attention and then you can, you can self-select a sound

290
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,600
that it will make when, you know, like an egg timer.

291
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,520
And it comes with this default, which I'm kind of grooving on recently,

292
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,760
which in some countries is used on television shows, apparently.

293
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,360
And it's great.

294
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,080
And there's a 30-day evaluation period.

295
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,840
And I was going to buy the program anyway.

296
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,280
And so now I got a free license.

297
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,320
And I hope that other people who are looking for Countdown timers,

298
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,240
it should you need one in your podcast.

299
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,120
We'll take a look at Countdown Clock at contactplus.com.

300
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,440
See, that is how the technology company of today operates.

301
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,200
Let me see.

302
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,880
What else do we have here?

303
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,840
Oh, this was like we got some good feedback and questions and comments on the

304
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,840
pod-sick music network.

305
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,320
And splits and fees and payments and royalties and all kinds of stuff like that.

306
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,800
Here's one dear to my heart about the tax man.

307
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,400
Adam Jason from San Diego.

308
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,840
And listen to your shows and your sounds that you're ready to roll out your

309
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,960
pod-sick music network, music cell and machine.

310
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,800
And I just wanted to touch base with you on something.

311
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:29,240
See, if you actually look into the tax implementations that you might have

312
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,080
in giving checks to these artists who are giving you music

313
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,920
and you're selling it on there, we have.

314
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,520
There's just something that if you have a look into,

315
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,120
I'm sure you've worked all out.

316
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,080
But if not, I would just recommend having your lawyers be with other lawyers

317
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,280
and lawyer talk and make sure that you're open it out in the

318
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,960
clear and you're not sending yourself up for a huge tax liability.

319
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,880
Anywho, love what you do, keep doing it, rock on.

320
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,640
Go dude, thank you, appreciate it.

321
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,440
Yes, we actually have quite a bit of experience with this.

322
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,040
Brian Longus, who is our director, I'm sorry, senior VP of operations.

323
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,440
I didn't want to demote him like Michael Butler always does.

324
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,200
Has a lot of experience with affiliate networks and with global payments.

325
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,600
The hardest thing actually is, if you're a member of Amazon as an example,

326
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,680
they'll send you a check, they'll send you a US-based check which in most countries

327
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,160
around the world cost three times as much to process through your local bank

328
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,760
as the actual amount on the check itself, which really sucks.

329
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:43,240
So the most obvious thing to solve is, how do we get money to people as efficiently as possible?

330
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,880
The taxation issues were very rare when I appreciate you saying that.

331
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,440
Yes, I filled the sense say we're up a little bit too much with milk today, so it's getting cold

332
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,960
on our second. I love making it with milk. I love it with milk.

333
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:07,160
What else was I going to say regarding that? I think we hit that one.

334
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:15,240
So melts I wanted to talk about, I'll suck on me, just move this down here. I'm doing

335
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,720
stuff from my outliner here so that I can keep track of everything. What do we have on the

336
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,680
satellite window? Another six minutes good. So the news now about Google, Google providing a

337
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:31,400
sanitized version of their search results to the people's Republic of China.

338
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:38,120
And so what I'm hearing and reading and seeing everywhere is, oh, you know, now they're

339
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,240
they're only doing half evil, they are evil, you have all kinds of complaining and whining and

340
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,520
moaning. And well, I'm thinking, well, what is the big deal? First of all, if we truly believe

341
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:53,320
in freedom of speech, we should be helping our brothers and sisters in the people's Republic of China

342
00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:00,840
and enabling them to get access to information that is being held back by their government

343
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,680
and by complacent corporations. Now, by the way, I'm not against Google stands and they're saying,

344
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,760
hey, at least we're getting something to them and we'll keep working on it. Okay, that's fine.

345
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,000
You know, I have, I have no other opinion about that. But from what I've seen,

346
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:22,200
there's some form of filtering going on based upon words, words like freedom, like sex, like

347
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,520
anal intrusion, you know, whatever. And the results actually show up and it says,

348
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:34,120
underneath the results, it'll say, some of the results for this query have been filtered for your

349
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:39,720
protection or whatever. Well, how simple is this shit? I mean, if we really want to help, our

350
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,280
brothers and sisters, all we have to do is come up with some simple schemes that just translate

351
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,760
the words into something else and then back to the original words on the other end. You know,

352
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,160
we can keep out running this as fast as we want. It's like the, you know, it's simple

353
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:59,000
cipher stuff. You know, and, of course, Google then have to work on replacing the code and

354
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,760
working out the ciphers. I mean, it's substitution cipher. You know, like my daughter, she's on on MSN

355
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:12,120
and very often when she wants to have a private conversation, PAW parents are watching.

356
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:19,480
She switches to a font, which like the Zing Daps, Zip Vits font, whatever, that just shows

357
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,280
symbol. So you can't read it. I mean, stuff like that is really simple. Shouldn't we all, if we

358
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,160
really truly believe that we want to help our brothers and sisters in China? And I do believe that,

359
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,480
shouldn't we be, you know, not be bitching, shouldn't we be immediately creating,

360
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,040
maybe a whole separate set of documents? You know, I'd like a plugin for my weblog software that

361
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:46,680
when I click it, it also produces a document which at first glance will look like a lot of

362
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:55,320
gibberish because the words freedom will be spelled as, you know, FR33D0M or something like that.

363
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,840
I mean, it seems simple enough to circumvent the filters. And I think if we can organize

364
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,160
where we would all have these, oh, I'm just starting to get into this. Now, where we all have these,

365
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:11,720
you know, little publishing widgets that are built into our systems, you publish and it produces

366
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:17,000
the page in English and it also produces a version that sits on your server and gets indexed,

367
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,520
but, you know, all of the offensive quote words that get filtered out are shaped like,

368
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:26,120
instead of saying porn, we say, prawn, you know, PR-0N. Come on, how hard is this? So let's,

369
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:31,560
you know, stop beating Google and Yahoo and Microsoft over the head. And although important to

370
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,120
make note of what they're doing, I don't want to, you know, I don't want that fact to be buried at all,

371
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,400
but come on, technologists, let's get this going. You know, this is how about the WordPress

372
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:48,840
development organization, you know, this is a great idea for a plugin. And what are they doing with

373
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,160
digital media files? Are they going to scan every single one for the words freedom or they're just going to

374
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,760
block all MP3 files and all podcasts? I don't know. Hey, if you're in the People's Republic of China,

375
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,240
send me an email, add them at curie.com. Let me know if you can hear the sound of my voice.

376
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,800
This is good stuff, you know, we can, we can really make a difference here. Let's not focus,

377
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,760
and let's not give up just because, you know, there's a, there's some form of firewall in place.

378
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,800
My God, we can hack into Paris, Hilton's phone. We can certainly circumvent this.

379
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,800
This will call me down.

380
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:31,720

385
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,560
Wanted to leave you an audio comment just driving here in my car, fart at the i River. I was

386
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:09,880
listening to DSC322 and you asked for some artist feedback on this split business

387
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:16,120
with selling music over the PMM. Anyways, wanted to say, long time listener, a long time

388
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:24,120
fan of what you're doing, love podcasting, got into it cash, like 2004 and 2004, something

389
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,200
like that, loved it, loved it, loved it, then loving and listening to the DSC for a long time.

390
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,040
Got my own podcast, by the way, carcinator.com, go check it out.

391
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,040
As an artist, about this split business,

392
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:50,440
under the old system, riders and publishers and whatever would get mere pennies. Each time

393
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:57,320
their works were played on radio or their works were sold on a CD or out or whatever.

394
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,280
I'm talking pennies. I don't know exactly what it is. I'm as a cap, but the PMM pays pretty much the same

395
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:10,360
here in the States. It's not 10 cents. It's not very much money per player. It's been on the radio.

396
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,240
You know, you're sitting in your car listening to your serious satellite radio. The stars

397
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,000
103 think, and hey, this guy's in his car. He's talking some interesting stuff about

398
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,400
making money in the independent music business. But you can't listen to it all because

399
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,040
the windows closing. The specific coast, hell, way is next and you can always join in the

400
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,760
festivities tomorrow and the thank God it's Friday edition of the source code.

401
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,320
And for y'all who were hanging out on the podcast, we continue. So with podcasting, what

402
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:45,560
sounds really cool is not podcasting specifically, but through a podcast, somebody purchased

403
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:53,000
as your music eventually through PMM. I mean, the idea that you could get 25, 30 cents or 40 cents

404
00:24:53,480 --> 00:25:02,600
on the dollar or per sale is just stupid money for a writer, publisher, artist, whatever you are

405
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:09,720
in the old system. So with how we should go forward and kind of what you ask for,

406
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,920
you know, some feedback and it's yet. Why not we, why don't we look at it like this?

407
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:21,640
Potchos taking nothing up front, which by the way, hey, that's so fucking cool. And I love

408
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,640
that you're doing it. And I think it's going to really pay off for you in the long run so

409
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,120
good call on that. It's just, you know, way to go. But anyways,

410
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,640
whatever you take, which is, you know, nothing at first, whatever's left of that

411
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,920
should be split down the middle between the podcast that's sent you there or the artist. And

412
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,160
if no podcast, you know, if there's no referring podcast or whatever, there's no other

413
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:51,240
marty then, you know, the artist could take take all of it. All of what's left after, you know,

414
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:57,800
PMM processes it. That's nothing for now, whatever it is later. You know, those are my thoughts.

415
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:03,080
So whatever the, the sense work out to be, let's say at first, I'm getting 50 cents on one of my

416
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:08,600
songs that I sell on the PMM, then that's pretty amazing. I mean, you're talking 50 cents.

417
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:15,480
That's, that's stupid money, the old way. I mean, stupid money for the writer and the artist or

418
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,920
whatever. So, you know, then that leaves 50 cents if say, if I'm the artist, but I'm not the writer

419
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,680
and I'm not the publisher and I don't know how that would work out. Or let's just say it works out

420
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:31,240
that way. There's multiple parties involved on my side. I've got 50 cents to split up on, you know,

421
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,480
each unit sold. Now, I know we're going to be dealing in a lot smaller numbers, but hey, I mean,

422
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,560
I think it's a good place to start, you know, and if this grows into something huge,

423
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:45,000
you've got, you know, independence making some pretty good money, you know, as it were,

424
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,960
only far more money than I'd ever make, you know, getting my songs sold through iTunes.

425
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,160
You know, even though it's delivered to the internet, it's just, it's still paid using the old way.

426
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:00,600
So, you know, it's made a few people rich and it's, you know, made a lot of people

427
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:07,400
enslaved. So, whatever, you know, anyways, I'm weird. Hey, carcinator.com, if you want to check out my

428
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:15,160
website and what I do, and I admit thanks for the time, thanks for the great show, I'll be listening,

429
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:21,640
and talk to you all later. Thanks Adam. Yeah, all right, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. Thank you.

430
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:27,320
I appreciate it. The first artist, musician slash writer, songwriter, who was actually provided me

431
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,440
feedback on this issue. That's fantastic. I'm so happy to hear that, you know, that you already

432
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:38,600
know that you're going to be able to make a lot more money per sale than you would through iTunes.

433
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,920
Now, I just want to reiterate here, you know, we're not building a store, because a store means

434
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,520
everything's for sale. Remember, this is the pod save music network we're talking about. So, if you

435
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,520
don't want to make your, as an artist, you don't want to make your songs available for purchase

436
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:56,440
and DRM-free MP3 download. You don't have to, you know, that's fine. You could still only make

437
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:04,760
it available for podcasters. That's fantastic. Conversely, if you help in the purchasing process,

438
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,520
if you're there, the transaction, you send someone over who buys something. You can always donate

439
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:14,040
your money to the artist, your portion. That's no problem. And yesterday there was an idea for,

440
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:19,800
you know, like credits so that you could then offer a credit to someone else to, you know,

441
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,920
for them to get a free song, the money would still go to the artist, you know, it's good stuff

442
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:29,640
there. And I think it would just make it, like he had a dog, man. Ever since Jesse died, he's,

443
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:35,000
he feels like he's, like he's really protecting the, the entire place. And he's no bigger than a

444
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:46,440
football, you know. Schwabar, it's okay. Damn. Okay, brief update on the court situation with a Dutch

445
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:52,680
rag mag. We're going to court. They, they tried, excuse me. He offered me,

446
00:28:52,680 --> 00:29:02,200
both at 1,500 bucks or euros. Sorry. Some caught my throat there. They offered me a hairball,

447
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:11,240
probably. Oh, no, I know what it is. Oh, god, late last night. Anyway, I'm sure Professor Lauren's

448
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,840
lesson will be happy to hear about the hairball. Because he got in touch with me through,

449
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,240
listener of the source code, who is apparently in one of his courses or classes or what you would call

450
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:27,320
that and Lawrence jump right in and he's working with my attorneys and we're taking these guys all the way.

451
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,320
There are two, two sets of procedures in the Netherlands. One is the Court of the Ding,

452
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:39,000
which is kind of like an express process. And in that, you know, we're going to have the judge,

453
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,120
the judge has to base and remember, no jury here, only a judge. The judge has to say,

454
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:50,200
yes, violation of law, yes, endangerment of a child, yes, invasion of privacy.

455
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:57,480
And then, from there, we go into something called the Bowdoin Procedutor, which is a much

456
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,600
longer process. It could take two or three years, actually, where we actually get into,

457
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:08,040
you know, how much money they made, how endangered the child was, you know, all this stuff.

458
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:13,480
But first, we get a year or an a and then we go into the, to the second process. I'm really

459
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,040
doing, I'm taking this all the way because I'm just pissed, you know, when you have women and

460
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:23,800
children being sued for for allegedly or even if they are, you know, sharing some MP3 files

461
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:32,920
to the tune of, you know, $50,000 dollars as a fine and the, you know, the RIA settlement agency

462
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,480
calls you trying to finagle you into a settlement. Hey, man, screw it, you know, it works the

463
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,760
other way around too, particularly with creative comments. It's important that we prove that this

464
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,440
does hold up in court. So this shit just can't happen. The arrogance just blows me away.

465
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:55,960
Real arrogance from these guys. So the, the expedited procedure may even serve next week,

466
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,960
as soon as next week or early next week. So I'll let you know, keep you up the speed on that.

467
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,760
Hey, Adam, it's Brian from Jester on the Pod Safe Music Network here. I had some thoughts

468
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,800
regarding the recent discussion about introducing new people to podcasts and the usual response

469
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:19,800
of, I don't have an iPod. Now I like to burn CDs of my favourite podcasts for my friends,

470
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,480
and I thought it would be a really good idea to have a short five minute what is a podcast intro

471
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,600
that anybody can download and burn onto a CD that they're giving out to their friends. Of course,

472
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,960
the podfather himself would be the obvious choice of hosts for this. So how about making

473
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,600
a special introduction and saying something like, Hi, this is Adam Curry. The person that gave

474
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,320
this CD would like to introduce you to the wonderful world of podcasting. You could then go on to

475
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,920
explain how to get podcasts, why people should use the subscription features, and why they don't

476
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:57,080
need a freaking iPod. I think this might be a really valuable resource to get lots of new listeners.

477
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,080
You know, I like that idea very much. Hold on, let's do it right now. Stick this on fun of

478
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,800
whatever you're going to burn onto a CD for a friend. And let's try this on for size. Hold on a second.

479
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,560
So I do it a little bit of echo, make it kind of like an attention getter. Oh no, let me see,

480
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:16,760
what I do it here. Hello, hello, okay. Now that's too late. I can't do that.

481
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:23,080
Oh, the delta in a dime. Hi, this is Adam Curry. Now the person that gave you this CD did so

482
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:29,320
to introduce you to the wonderful world of podcasting. As you can hear, you don't need an iPod

483
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:34,600
to enjoy the wealth of information and passion that podcasting has to offer. Ask your friend

484
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,640
about their favorite site to learn more about podcasting and enjoy this podcast.

485
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:46,040
There. See, that way you could wherever you learned about podcasting, whatever work for you,

486
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:51,560
you can send them off there. So there you go. It's a good idea. And if we want to do more

487
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,000
produced stuff, we can. Let's just see how this one works. Now let me get onto your comment

488
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
because you had something else pretty cool I wanted to share. On a different topic and under

489
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,120
the alternative advertising category, I've just added a new song to the pod safe news it

490
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,840
network, which is dedicated to my favorite daily source code inspired Christmas present.

491
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,640
Yes, that one. Check it out on the PMN under the artist's name,

492
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:19,640
Justa, that's J-E-S-T-A. Thanks, Adam. Bye.

493
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:28,440
Justa? Well, so let me tell you, the timing of this could not be better. We've got KJ in

494
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:35,000
New York, Atlanta, Chicago, preparing for the next trip that Ron and I are going to take to New York

495
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,880
Atlanta, Chicago. Because, you know, we're going back to Madison Avenue. It's time for round two.

496
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,880
We want to have stuff baked into budgets for next year. And, you know, we've got a lot of interest,

497
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:51,880
particularly around what's happening with some of the advertising and some of the reactions we've

498
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:59,160
seen from our listeners in podcasting. So, how cool is it when someone threw an advertising

499
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:05,320
that was made by a listener? Riddlekakes made that, made the the initial ad. And we talked about

500
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:11,240
the eye dog a lot. You know, we had ongoing conversations about it and feedback from you guys,

501
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:17,080
which we continued to loop through everything. It was fun to talk about. You bought one.

502
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,920
And then you liked it so much. You made a song about it, which you've now made available on the

503
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:27,400
podcasting music network. This blows me away and check out the song.

504
00:34:47,080 --> 00:35:17,080
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I

505
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:47,080
love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love me, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you , I love you,I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love me, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you,

506
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,080
You would take for four and right

507
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,820
And the thing that I need

508
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,580
Cause from inside and not never go

509
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,080
It's all I need is me

510
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,580
My music and my eyes out

511
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,580
I don't care about anything

512
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,080
I don't need a sweet

513
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,580
My music and my eyes out

514
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,580
I don't care about anything else

515
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,080
Now now

516
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,580
All I need is me

517
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,380
Cause I'm music and my eyes out

518
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,900
I don't care about anything, there's all I need as need

519
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,640
From music and my eyes out

520
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,820
I don't care about anything, there's all I need as need

521
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,640
I don't care about anything, there's all I need

522
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,920
I don't care about anything, there's all I need

523
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,640
From music and my eyes out

524
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,720
I don't care, there's all I need

525
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,720
I don't care about anything, there's all I need

526
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:03,720
I don't care about anything, there's all I need

527
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,760
I don't care about anything

528
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,020
I don't care about anything, there's all I need

529
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:17,620
I don't care about anything, there's all I need

530
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:21,760
I don't care about anything

531
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,080
Do you realize what's happening here?

532
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,100
There's a fricking revolution, this is fantastic

533
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,820
Can you imagine this happening in traditional media?

534
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,320
No way!

535
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,100
No way in hell!

536
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,820
hell and it certainly wouldn't make it onto the air. No way. Now, here's what I could predict

537
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:42,380
the next step would be. If someone out there has video editing skills, you know, make a video

538
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:47,740
for this. Make a commercial. I can only imagine how quick, you know, it's the typical,

539
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:52,060
poppy, dribble thing, friends like sounding, thing that would get your attention and make

540
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:56,220
you feel good about the eye dog. Come on, you can feel it. You know, and then everyone could

541
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,220
get paid for contributing in that process. He's.

542
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:56,060
I think I'll hold the PMN back just a little bit.

543
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:01,820
Something I didn't know, but was pointed out to me. I've been talking about this auto-delete

544
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:07,420
function that is in iTunes. If you don't listen to more than five episodes or five episodes

545
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,660
of a podcast that stops downloading new episodes for you and it kind of messes you up on high

546
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:20,540
frequency output feeds. Well, it turns out, according to Dorky Dude, Dorky Dude,

547
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:27,340
he says, I recently downloaded iTunes 6.0.2.2 3 and they fixed the podcast problem.

548
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:31,580
Right click on a podcast and click, do not auto-delete. Hope this helps you in the listeners.

549
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,420
Thank you. Indeed. I didn't know that. So I've already, and it's still not a default,

550
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:40,860
but this is better than nothing. So that is appreciated. But I think it should still be default.

551
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:45,180
Otherwise, you know, people can definitely get confused. And I think at this point, it's about

552
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:49,980
the experience for the listeners. Wouldn't you agree? Hey, everybody. This is Bob from the podcast reviewer.

553
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:54,620
I want you to check out my show at the podcast reviewer.com. I'm not a regular review show.

554
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:59,100
I actually care about what the podcasters think of what I'd say in the reviews. And I even try to

555
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:05,340
help them. If you're a podcaster, send me your podcast to the podcast reviewer at gmail.com.

556
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:10,460
And if you're a pod guest listener, well, come listen to my podcast. I listen to all the crap.

557
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:16,300
So you don't have to. If I say it's good, it's going to be a good podcast. And if I say it sucks,

558
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:21,020
well, you can download it. You can listen to one episode and find out that I'm right. So

559
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:28,940
check me out at www.the podcaseryviewer.com or shoot me an email at the podcast reviewer at gmail.com.

560
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:34,540
So I think this is good. I think we need more podcas like this, you know. And, you know,

561
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:38,700
create your own directory, strap that onto indiepotted.org. You know, I definitely feel that we need

562
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:44,860
more pathfinders who can show the way for different communities. You know, and it would be great if you

563
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:49,660
can make a podcast, which is really a jumping off point. I try to do that obviously a lot with the

564
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:57,660
daily source code. All right. That's it for me for today. Patricia's going away to

565
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:05,020
visit her sister for a couple of days tomorrow. So Nick and Roy are going to pick her up. Now the

566
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:12,540
the 182 RG is a momentarily entirely dismantled. It's getting a black edition engine put in

567
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:17,820
new interior and oh yes, that one empty spot on the dashboard, Patricia wants me to put a clock

568
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:27,420
in it so she can see what time it is. Back seat. That's so wrong. So she's they're taking

569
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:32,860
their picking up in her mooney, which is kind of like the Porsche. I would say a single engine

570
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:41,820
four seaters. It's very fast. And then I'm taking Christina and her new boyfriend, Owen. Oh yes.

571
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:50,140
Taking them to a gig in London Friday evening and that is panic at the disco and two other

572
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:55,420
bands that forget their names. And since Owen lives an hour and a half train ride from Gilford,

573
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:03,660
he'll be staying over. Oh yes, separate bedrooms, of course. It was so cute. I overheard Christina

574
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:08,700
talking to Patricia yesterday and they were talking about Owen. And she said, isn't he's an acute mom?

575
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:13,020
Look, he's like really tall and lanky and gauky, just like daddy. That's like home.

576
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:20,300
Of course, I don't have the four lip piercings and the nipple rings. But otherwise,

577
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:26,140
he's a sweet kid. Hey, I'll talk to you guys tomorrow. Thanks for staying subscribed.

578
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:31,340
Thanks for listening, daily source code dot com for new shows and subscription and Adam and

579
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:43,180
create our com for feedback to care. Another pot show pot cast. Stick it in your ear.
