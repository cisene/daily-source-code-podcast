00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Delta Sierra Charley, 3-2-9er.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:28,760
This podcast is not, I repeat not, family safe.

3
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:36,360
I take a look at my enormous penis and my troubles start a melt-in-away.

4
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:45,360
I take a look at my enormous penis and the happy times are coming to stay.

5
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:53,560
I got a saying and a dance when I glancing my pants and the feelings like a sunshine day.

6
00:00:53,560 --> 00:01:00,560
I take a look at how my enormous penis and everything is going my way.

7
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,560
$60 million worth of airplane strapped my ass.

8
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,560
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

9
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,560
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,560
I'm adjusting his attitude, curing.

11
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,560
I got it.

12
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,560
Oh, yeah, everybody.

13
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,560
It is fun.

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,560
I give a sleep.

15
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,560
I want to try.

16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,560
Beyond playing with your sleep is fun.

17
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,560
I need a little luxury.

18
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,560
With your arms around me.

19
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,560
And the feeling that you're on high.

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:15,560
You give all my everything I do to go.

21
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:22,560
So I'm all I can think of getting up my ear.

22
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,560
I need a little luxury.

23
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,560
With your arms around me.

24
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,560
And the feeling that you're on high.

25
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,560
I'm the free that I hear.

26
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:54,560
And I want you there.

27
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:12,560
I need a little luxury.

28
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,560
With your arms around me.

29
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,560
And the feeling that you're on high.

30
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:30,560
And the feeling that you're on high.

31
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,560
And the feeling that you're on high.

32
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,560
And the little luxury.

33
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
And the music dot pot show dot com.

34
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
Hey, everybody.

35
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
How you doing?

36
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Welcome to the daily source code.

37
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,560
Three, two, nine are coming to you from Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

38
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,560
Well, we haven't done this in a while.

39
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,560
We haven't done the cast blaster solo set up.

40
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,560
So just a quick note on that.

41
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,560
This entire show is being recorded and produced on on a wafer thin note book.

42
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,560
The only external piece of equipment I'm using is my wireless microphone.

43
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,560
So I can roam around.

44
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,560
Of course, I'm tethered on tethered to the laptop with the headphones.

45
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,560
But anyway, so all processing everything is all going directly through cast blaster.

46
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,560
Actually, I know I found something really cool.

47
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,560
When you use cast blaster the way I'm using it now, not within an external mixer.

48
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,560
The songs actually are written out digitally into the file.

49
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,560
So those of you who've been working with me on getting sound volumes just right and really working on.

50
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Yeah, tweaking the sound a bit.

51
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,560
Let me know how it sounds today.

52
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,560
So in the Netherlands for simple reason, I was going to visit my mom.

53
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,560
Now the plans really got messed up yesterday.

54
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,560
What was going to happen is I was going to be picked up by Roy and I think Nick was going to come along.

55
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,560
They were going to pick me up in Sessner 172 since the Delta Shira is in pieces still.

56
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,560
Although I do believe the re-opholstery of the chairs is being done as we speak.

57
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,560
So that one couldn't fly.

58
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,560
Oh, with smaller aircraft, there's a couple things you got to watch out for obviously.

59
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,560
And one really important one is icing.

60
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,560
And the conditions at Farrow's airport would just perfect, perfect icing conditions.

61
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,560
And quite honestly, it was pretty crappy all around.

62
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,560
I was planning on flying from Farrow's in the morning to a Rotterdam.

63
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Then hop in a cab.

64
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,560
Actually, taxi Eric was going to meet me there taking over to my mom.

65
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Would hang out and then I'd drive back late to last night.

66
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,560
And then would kind of hang out in the hotel today.

67
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Do the show and then leave.

68
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,560
Unfortunately, due to icing, I had to make a choice between not going.

69
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,560
Or going on staleosis, lovely aircraft.

70
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Of course, easy jet.

71
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:02,560
I got to tell you, you still can't beat that for just efficient travel between European states as I would call them.

72
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,560
Of course, the whole trip was just marred with all kinds of interesting episodes.

73
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,560
I got to get work airport, went in, went through customs, and you know,

74
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,560
I just put my belt back on at the security and the fire alarm went off.

75
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,560
And it was like a bell, and then there was a fire alarm.

76
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,560
Please, what do you say exactly?

77
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,560
It was a pre-programmed voice, but it was really nice.

78
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
Please depart through the nearest exit.

79
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:38,560
And I've been in a number of evacuation scenarios, none of them life threatening.

80
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,560
And this one also turned out to be a false alarm.

81
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,560
But I must say, the public that was there.

82
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,560
And I'm going to have to presume that most of them were British.

83
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,560
Certainly the way employees really helped everyone find the exit get out.

84
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
It was really within a minute.

85
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
The entire departure lounge was empty.

86
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
It was unbelievable.

87
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,560
And of course, doing all went out, turned around, and got in line.

88
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,560
It customs again, to go through the whole thing all over again.

89
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
So I got in late last night.

90
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Well, not late, but actually in time for late dinner with my banker.

91
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,560
I have a banker here, Ferdie in Holland.

92
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,560
And I said to her, you know, well, where do you want to eat?

93
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
Said this is a place called Vuong.

94
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,560
Victor uniform Oscar November golf.

95
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,560
It's right off the lights of playing.

96
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
And she sent me a link to it.

97
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,560
And I looked at the link and I said, I'll wait a minute.

98
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,560
I know I didn't know if it was Audrey Rangers.

99
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,560
If it was his restaurant or one of his sons.

100
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
But I do know Andrew.

101
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
And I have met his sons before.

102
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,560
They've got a couple of clubs and restaurants.

103
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,560
And actually they do a lot of investments in high tech.

104
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:56,560
And they have a consultancy bureau for US companies looking to do stuff in Europe and the Netherlands and the Far East.

105
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,560
And so I fired off an email.

106
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,560
I said, hey, dude, you and your popular place.

107
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
They were able for me.

108
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,560
So yeah, of course, it was like, you know, it was a real celebrity moment.

109
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,560
It worked out.

110
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,560
I could call the owner and get a table.

111
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
I was cool.

112
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,560
And then after that, and actually Audrey and his son Rob joined us.

113
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,560
And we chatted a bit and they opened up a club, I think.

114
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,560
Wow, let me think was it almost three years ago called Jimmy Wu.

115
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,560
And Jimmy Wu is the place to go in Amsterdam.

116
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,560
They can ask any celebrity in Hollywood who's been through Amsterdam.

117
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,560
They will tell you that they hung out at Jimmy Wu's.

118
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,560
And what it's funny about is when I first met Adrian and his sons of Jimmy Wu was still being built.

119
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
I've never actually seen it completed.

120
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,560
And it was quite impressive.

121
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,560
It was very, I'm not much for clubs and drinking.

122
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,560
As you know, I like my poison administered in different ways.

123
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,560
But it was nice.

124
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,560
It was definitely a good hang.

125
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,560
Even that one hour time difference between the UK and the continent.

126
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,560
And kind of messed me up a bit.

127
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,560
So, you know, I don't know.

128
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,560
I was awake at like 630 UK time, which was 730 here.

129
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,560
But yeah, I know it only slept like five or six hours.

130
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
I was just weird.

131
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,560
Right now, I'm doing the show.

132
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,560
Gonna get it in the can up on, well, of course, you're listening to it now on.

133
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,560
A serious star is 103.

134
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,560
And obviously the podcast.

135
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,560
And then I'm going to have some lunch.

136
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,560
And then I'm going to go visit my mom.

137
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,560
Stay for dinner.

138
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,560
And then I'll go back around.

139
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
I'll leave her.

140
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Erica picked me up around eight and then it's back on the plane and back home.

141
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,560
And then we start celebrating the weekend because it is the Friday.

142
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,560
And turned on the news this morning.

143
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,560
Wow, big news about this Danish newspaper that published a cartoon of the

144
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:53,560
Prophet Muhammad with his head and his, I guess it's, it's not a turbine.

145
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,560
The proper name is, but basically his head was kind of like a bomb with a, you know,

146
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,560
like one of those wily, wily coyote bombs with a fuse ready to go off.

147
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,560
And that has really stirred up a lot of crap in, in Europe.

148
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,560
Muslims are really pissed off.

149
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:15,560
And it's spread now to France and Germany who have also reproduced this picture.

150
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560
The news was showing it.

151
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,560
They were showing the picture on television.

152
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,560
And I think there's a bit of confusion here.

153
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,560
Now between, you know, is this a freedom of speech, a freedom of expression,

154
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:36,560
debate or, or, or move, or is it perhaps we still need to be sensitive about other

155
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,560
cultures, other religions, et cetera.

156
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,560
And, and take that to heart.

157
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,560
You know, so I'm not quite sure what the consensus is.

158
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:52,560
But definitely, there's tensions are running a little bit high, certainly, in some European countries.

159
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,560
Speaking of which, if I don't play this now, I'm in deep shit.

160
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,560
Hello, Adam Curry. This is quasi-tholic.

161
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,560
And this is Anthony, the stupid bit from the quasi-tholic election, right?

162
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,560
And the word on the street is that you screwed Louis.

163
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
You screwed Louis.

164
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,560
This is serious.

165
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,560
This is serious.

166
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,560
This is a matter of fact.

167
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
That's how we screwed him, man.

168
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
We were supposed to get in the series.

169
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,560
Same like feet, but that Adam Curry doesn't know how he uses backwards count down time over there.

170
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
Serious?

171
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,560
Serious?

172
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
Oh, wow.

173
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,560
Anyway, Adam Curry, it looks like somebody's gonna have to pay.

174
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
Right, put it this respect shown to quite stone.

175
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,560
First off, we're gonna have to fire that Roger Smalls here.

176
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,560
Wait, wait.

177
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,560
Oh, Roger Smalls.

178
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
The eagle has landed.

179
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
Get out of town. Get out of town.

180
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,560
You're supposed to do all split.

181
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
Roger, don't dig the normal garbage.

182
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,560
Get out of my car.

183
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Oh, sorry.

184
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,560
I dig just two.

185
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
Get out of town.

186
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,560
Right.

187
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,560
Some blood is gonna have to hit the ground here.

188
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,560
What is going to spill tonight?

189
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,560
Shall we stay in here when it's the flock of goats?

190
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,560
Stoke a betshe's preparing the gun.

191
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
We are going to slay a goat.

192
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
Right here on your show, Adam Curry.

193
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,560
To show you that nobody disrespects quite slowly.

194
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
Or to spill a betshe's like that.

195
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
Nobody.

196
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,560
This is what happens, Carly.

197
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,560
Oh, my goodness.

198
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,560
That is one bloody goat mess.

199
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,560
One bloody bottle of goat.

200
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,560
The next goat.

201
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
That's what happens, Carly.

202
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
And so in the meantime.

203
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,560
Tell all you listeners to go to quasi-tolid.com.

204
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,560
Tell them to do it.

205

We revolve around you.

218
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,560
Just realize I haven't had a single drop of coffee this morning.

219
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,560
You know what we call up and we call room service and get some.

220
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,560
Let me see, could I have a speaker phone here?

221
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,560
Yes, there we go. Room service.

222
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,560
It's an old-fashioned dialer.

223
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,560
Check that out.

224
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,560
What the hell is that?

225
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,560
Well, that's not all right.

226
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,560
Let me, uh, I'll go through the operator.

227
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
Hey.

228
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,560
What the hell is this?

229
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,560
Oh, man.

230
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
Can't believe it.

231
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
All right, forget that.

232
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,560
I'll order some during the last song of the day.

233
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,560
The last song of the week.

234
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,560
Boy, it's been quite a week, hasn't it?

235
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,560
A lot of technical stuff has gone wrong.

236
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:46,560
I've spent probably the equivalent of an entire day fixing email problems and computers

237
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
and all kinds of crap.

238
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,560
The blackberry is still on the fridge and I have to go through that whole process and call up

239
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,560
customer help and give them our tax ID number and not looking forward to it.

240
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Now, to get this set up perfectly, I've got to put that up there.

241
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,560
Yes, yeah, I was worried about that.

242
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,560
She's going to be the two-saw.

243
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:16,560
Okay, it has a preset volume.

244
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,560
Okay.

245
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,560
So while you hear that very faintly in the background, do we try that again?

246
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,560
I want to second.

247
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,560
Let me see.

248
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,560
I think I can set the sound settings different in cast blaster.

249
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,560
This is where the whole system kind of breaks down when you want to do multiple,

250
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
there we go, preset.

251
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,560
When you want to do multiple sound files, let's see if that's what we're doing.

252
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:44,560
Natural, sexual, natural, sexual, natural, sexual, sexual.

253
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,560
It's an encourage, metro, sexual moment.

254
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,560
David, David, David, David.

255
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,560
And encourage, metro, sexual moment.

256
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,560
Yeah.

257
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:01,560
Well, we have had so much fun in the past couple weeks here at the metro, sexual moment corner

258
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:08,560
that we're actually getting some pretty serious players to jump on board and give it up with some...

259
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,560
Oops.

260
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,560
Oh, shoot.

261
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,560
Oh, man, this is sucking so bad.

262
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,560
That's true.

263
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,560
That's true.

264
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
Oh, you know what?

265
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,560
Let me...

266
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,560
Oh, God.

267
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,560
I'm so sorry.

268
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,560
This is...

269
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
That's true.

270
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
That's true.

271
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,560
That's true.

272
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,560
That's true.

273
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
That's true.

274
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
That's true.

275
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
That's true.

276
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,560
That's true, that's true.

277
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,560
That's true.

278
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
That's true.

279
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,560
That's true.

280
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,560
That's true.

281
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,560
Hey, Anna.

282
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
It's يا about the telephone.

283
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,560
What kind of texting is that?

284
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,560
It's really easy toризide.

285
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,560
Good ли pas.

286
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,560
Now, when I share my husband's favourite mentally-fectoral shaving tip,

287
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,560
When he showers he uses a product called sugar scrub,

288
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,560
you can get it just about anywhere.

289
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,560
It's a mixture of sugar

290
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
and a central oils.

291
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,560
He likes it on his face when he showers to exfoliate, dead skin.

292
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,680
a dead skin, and the oil protects the skin from the harshness of the blade.

293
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,040
He doesn't do it every day, but when he does, I love touching his face, and it smells good, too.

294
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,040
Thanks again, Adam.

295
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,360
That's Callie from Geek Brief.

296
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,280
That's Geek Brief.potshow.com.

297
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,480
Well, I heard heart shatter all across the universe there, as it turns out, Callie has a

298
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,880
see a husband, oh man, love the show Cali.

299
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,480
Hey Adam, it's Mark Yoshimoto and M.Coffin.

300
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,960
Since you're always looking for a metro-sexual tips, I thought I'd throw you a bone.

301
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,440
Calm down, that's just a figure of speech.

302
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,800
Now, when I first moved to Southern California or Planet Siliconia as we call her on the

303
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,200
hell, I went and got myself an apartment by the beach.

304
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,680
I bought myself a brand new convertible and proceeded to drive around with the top down

305
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,120
everywhere I went.

306
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,600
And if it was just going to mail some letters or my weekly donation of cash to poor

307
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,040
starving children in Africa.

308
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,480
What I ended up with only after a few days was a horrific sunburn on my forehead.

309
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,120
What I needed to do every night when I got home was moisturized.

310
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,900
So I proceeded to try a number of products and not only did it help keep my face from

311
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,360
peeling off of my scalp.

312
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,840
But I noticed it made my skin look a lot better, too, and over the years, I've kind

313
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:27,040
of honed my routine down to an exact science and now I'm going to let you and your listeners

314
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,960
in on my secret.

315
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,640
And if you're expecting me to make a joke about rubbing a freshly-aborted cheap fetus

316
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,640
on my face, well, that's just not the case.

317
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,840
It's not funny and trust me, the little bits of after birth actually clogged your pores.

318
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,120
But I digress.

319
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,400
One I do.

320
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,840
Is wash my face with a soap I discovered after receiving it in a gift bag at some Hollywood

321
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,840
function.

322
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:58,280
It's called Dr. Bronner's 18-in-1 hemp peppermint pure castile soap.

323
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
Okay, okay.

324
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Calm down Adam.

325
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
You can't smoke it.

326
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
Let me trust me.

327
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,120
You'll only end up passing out with a terrible headache and waking up wearing someone else's

328
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,120
underwear.

329
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:13,240
Dr. Bronner's soap is completely 100% organic and not only will leave your face cleaner

330
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,880
than you ever felt it, but the peppermint oil is a natural anti-biotic to kill unwanted

331
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,680
bacteria that may accumulate in your pores.

332
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:29,360
Then once your face is dry, use a product called BioElements Urban Detox Vitamin Serum.

333
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,400
Now, what does that do you ask?

334
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,440
Honestly, I have no frickin' idea, but I've noticed that it does seem to smooth the tiny

335
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,560
wrinkles in your skin and, you know, you smooth a hundred little wrinkles on your face

336
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,880
and you can tell the difference right away.

337
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,480
Now, what Urban Detox also does is help your skin absorb the moisturizer and that's the

338
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,160
third and final step.

339
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,880
When I'm moisturized, I use O-lay complete.

340
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,160
It's light, non-greasy, and won't clog your pores.

341
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:02,520
It also has the SPF-15 and doesn't smell like a Las Vegas call girl or your favorite grandma

342
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,200
and, you know, Adam, if you're into those kind of things, well, maybe you'll have to

343
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,200
try this new product called Hor by Mabelene, but that's all up to you buddy.

344
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Anyway.

345
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,360
This is Mark Yoshimoto and M-Coffin' Sure enough, that's my Metro-sexual tip.

346
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,960
So, when you hit your mid and late 30s, you have to try harder to look good and, if I say

347
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,640
so myself, I sure do look good.

348
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,600
Well, at least that's what my wife and the several runaways I've picked up at the bus station

349
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,880
tell me.

350
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,760
Mark Yoshimoto and M-Coff, if you listen to this podcast on the Serious Stars 103, he'll

351
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,440
be up next with the Pacific Coast Highway and after that Metro-sexual moment, Mark, I have

352
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,680
to say, you now are officially...

353
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,920
A really big hair fat.

354
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,680
And, carries Metro-sexual moment, yeah.

355
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,680
Yeah, okay, getting used to the equipment here.

356
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:58,000
Okay, a couple more minutes left before we hit the satellite window.

357
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,600
Looks like we figured out this countdown clock problem and, as actually, as Kevin Sheldon

358
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,680
Bach pointed out, your solution is to blame Fenton's file important, important.

359
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,920
Yeah, that's almost true, of course, it's not PWB's mistake or his fault himself.

360
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:20,440
And the problem here is that I'm timing this show on my computer and then it turns

361
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,560
out to be 10 to 15 seconds longer on his computer.

362
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:30,840
And a couple of people sent me pretty much the same reasoning behind what's going on.

363
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,840
Here's one from Garen Heber.

364
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:38,800
He says, he said, I do audio professional programming professionally, the problem is the sample

365
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,040
rate on the sound card relative to the clock on your computer.

366
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,600
Neither of them is exactly correct, much less in sync.

367
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,240
What's going on is that, over the course of your show, the sound card is recording at a

368
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,520
rate just slightly too slow.

369
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,600
When played back on another sound card that's slightly faster, not necessarily more accurate,

370
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,800
just running at a slightly faster pace, the show ends a bit early.

371
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,280
Audibly, there's a slight pitch shift, but it's so small about half percent that it isn't

372
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,280
noticeable.

373
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:15,280
OK, well, yeah, I understand it and he broke it down into, you know, basically on both

374
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:23,080
computers, you're going to wind up with the 1800 seconds by 48,000 samples per second,

375
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:29,120
which is like 886 million samples or whatever, but I still don't understand when when

376
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,520
a show says it's 24 minutes and 30 seconds of my computer shouldn't it say it on every

377
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
computer?

378
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,920
Anyway, Cas Blaster Mike has jumped into this, he also knows a hell of a lot about sound

379
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,800
recording, obviously, because he's building this program and I'm sure he's going to

380
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,080
come up with something.

381
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,400
Well, I didn't actually, I do want to hear you.

382
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,920
You can have a transmission from Matthew Ebo.

383
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,920
Hey Adam, Adam, can you hear me?

384
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:04,480
Yeah, I got, I'm in the engine room, I can't hear you, but this is Matthew Ebo.

385
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,600
I don't know if you listen to my podcast or not, but I do the whole thing for my Starship,

386
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,880
just outside the Earth's atmosphere and took your advice and I'm converting the whole

387
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,120
ship to biodiesel, so we'll see how that works.

388
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,600
But I wanted to let you know, I played a show last night, actually, with Kevin Reads and Jeff

389
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
Smith.

390
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,320
You probably heard of him, he played both of whom I do show that played all three of us

391
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,320
in the show.

392
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,080
Actually, we did a little pot-safe showcase last night in Nashville, Tennessee, and man,

393
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,560
these guys can cook.

394
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,840
I got to tell you, we got to do more shows like this.

395
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:46,000
I'll keep you up to speed on this, but man, you should pay attention to this kind of stuff.

396
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,800
I think we're going to do some great things of pot-safe music live on stage in 2006.

397
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,640
It's going to be something to watch.

398
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,640
Anyway, keep up with it.

399
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,640
Oh no, it's starting to smoke.

400
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,640
I got to get going that, this and I'll talk to you later, make sure you have the good work

401
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,640
all right.

402
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,640
I love the show.

403
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,640
Galactic biodiesel, amen.

404
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Okay, once again, you're more than welcome to sing along.

405
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,640
It is our biodiesel piece too.

406
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:32,640
You know, I'm converting a lot of people.

407
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,640
These all engines are being sold quite a bit here in Europe, particularly popular

408
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,640
as the Volkswagen Passat I believe.

409
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,640
Trying to do my fader here.

410
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,640
Oh, that's not a good work out there, man.

411
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
Where was I?

412
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,640
Yeah, so people in the coming very interesting, actually, I talked to the restaurant guys about this

413
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,640
restaurant.

414
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,640
Either you're going to sit on this last night at the restaurant about this.

415
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
Man, what an opportunity.

416
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,640
Everyone who has a restaurant can have their entire fleet running on.

417
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,640
French fries.

418
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,640
Gotta say goodbye to everyone who's still checking the show out on a serious satellite

419
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
stars 103.

420
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,640
Up next, we'll see if it goes that way.

421
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,640
Followed by a mange, Don and Drew.

422
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,640
We've got the pot safe crew on the way.

423
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,640
I'll see you guys on Monday.

424
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,640
Bye.

425
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,640
You heard the satellite window closed coming through the little, the man the speaker of this

426
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,640
portage is absolutely correct.

427
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,640
It's like the size of one of this earbud just sticking your ear.

428
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:45,640
So, I won't be in San Francisco for another couple weeks still, but I cannot wait to see if I can

429
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,640
fire up now.

430
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,640
Every single time I think about Trinity, I keep thinking about the fuel supply.

431
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,640
It is below one quarter tank, so I've got a schedule of, so when I'm out and usually I

432
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,640
arrive on Sundays, of course, that's when the biofuelo waste is closed.

433
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:08,640
We're finally going to do that sound seeing tour.

434
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
A filling up Trinity.

435
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,640
The bio diesel beast.

436
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,640
If you've never heard of this, check out curried.com and search for Trinity.

437
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
You'll find out all about it.

438
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,640
She could talk.

439
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,640
You hear her fake.

440
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,640
I don't for grouping in her tank.

441
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
We're Trinity.

442
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,640
Trinity.

443
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
Yeah.

444
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,640
Hi, Adam Kelly Walker from Bloomington, Indiana.

445
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,640
I'm on the campus of Indiana University for a track meet.

446
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,640
And one of the schools attending is Murray State University.

447
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
I'm looking at one of their buses.

448
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,640
And on the back, it says leading the way in alternative fuels.

449
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,640
This bus powered by biodiesel.

450
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Clean, renewable, farm, grown.

451
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,640
Pretty interesting stuff to know that one of the universities here in the Midwest is running

452
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,640
their buses on biodiesel.

453
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,640
Anyway, I'll also hopefully in the next week or so have a promo for you for the Indiana University

454
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,640
mini university podcast.

455
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,640
It'll be one of the first podcasts to come from the campus of Indiana University.

456
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,640
Thanks for everything, Adam.

457
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,640
Thank you.

458
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,640
Thanks for checking in.

459
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,640
And I wonder if it's 100% biodiesel or is it mixture?

460
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:22,640
Because you can mix this vegetable oil-based biodiesel with any amount of petroleum-based

461
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,640
diesel that you want.

462
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,640
And any measure, it all works just perfectly fine.

463
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
So I think that, you know, Willie Nelson's biodiesel.

464
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,640
I believe is, I think it's B80.

465
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,640
So it's still, it's only 20% veggie oil and 80% petrochemical.

466
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
I believe it could be the other way around.

467
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,640
But the Trinity still crews none 100%.

468
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,640
And I played that audio comment outside of the Trinity theme music,

469
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,640
because I just can't seem to get the levels right.

470
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,640
Chad said, Adam, how do you figure the state of the Union address was one of the mill?

471
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Was Bush saying the US needs to wean itself of oil not a surprise enough for you?

472
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,640
No, it wasn't actually.

473
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,640
I took it a little bit differently.

474
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,640
I didn't take it as wean yourself off oil.

475
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,640
I thought it was less dependency on foreign oil.

476
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,640
And I believe that was specifically directed towards the Middle East.

477
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,640
Of course, there's there's oil in many different places.

478
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,640
But no, I did kind of expect him to say that.

479
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,640
I mean, look at what's going on in big oil industry.

480
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,640
Shell.

481
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,640
Shell oil.

482
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,640
Was it Shell?

483
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,640
Who reported yesterday?

484
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,640
I think it was.

485
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,640
Like, you know, it's something like 13 billion pounds of profit.

486
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,640
I mean, come on.

487
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,640
The people are now actually saying, hey, dude, wait a minute.

488
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,640
We're getting screwed.

489
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,640
We're paying these exorbitant prices at the gas pump.

490
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,640
And at the same time, these guys are making billions and billions of dollars in profit.

491
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:57,640
So it doesn't make sense that that's the message he was trying to convey.

492
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:02,640
But I thought it was, yeah, I thought it was kind of what I expected he would be saying.

493
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,640
A little bit humble or maybe, but yeah, I think it was, I mean,

494
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,640
state of the union somehow the words just don't weigh as heavy as they used to.

495
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,640
I don't know what it is, but I haven't seen the type of analysis that you see

496
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,640
maybe 10 years ago.

497
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,640
And I think that's purely because there's so much communication.

498
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,640
You know, there's, we all have our own opinions.

499
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:29,640
We're already talking about exactly those opinions before the state of the union address is even made.

500
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,640
I didn't enjoy on C-SPAN.

501
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,640
I was able to watch the, the minority response.

502
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:43,640
And in general, you know, when people ask me what's it like in the States, I say,

503
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,640
well, you know, there's a lot of red state blue state stuff.

504
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,640
But when you get down to it, man, we're all just people working and let me tell you,

505
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,640
people in America work much, much harder than the countries I've been in in Europe.

506
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,640
This, this, I don't know what it is.

507
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,640
And it just seems like people enjoy it more, maybe.

508
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,640
I don't know.

509
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,640
But well, of course, if you don't have a job in the States, then you basically will

510
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,640
have a job in dry and blow away with the wind.

511
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,640
Maybe that does have something to do with it.

512
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,640
Hey Adam, piggy love from Love House radio.

513
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,640
Just wanted to give you a quick comment on the splits for the pot safe music network.

514
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,640
But I first heard you talking about the splits to be honest with you.

515
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,640
And maybe I'm just not business minded enough as a podcaster.

516
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,640
But I never thought of the podcast you're getting any of the split.

517
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,640
I thought the split was going to be replaced with that one.

518
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
How did that sneak in there?

519
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,640
I'm sorry.

520
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,640
I apologize.

521
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,640
I guess I played that one yesterday.

522
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,640
You know what?

523
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,640
I think it was a mistake to do this show without coffee.

524
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,640
Well, I bet nitches for us is trying to hold my horses out.

525
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,640
I want to get serious.

526
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,640
Yeah.

527
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,640
Is that sure?

528
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,640
Was it looking?

529
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,640
Man, I'm bent.

530
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,640
Ever since the day we met.

531
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,640
Now I'm falling in deep prey.

532
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,640
Three hours and night ain't enough.

533
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,640
Yeah, just call their baby.

534
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,640
Lord help, they may be.

535
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,640
I'm just a little love.

536
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,640
A little in love.

537
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,640
Something tell me there's no such thing.

538
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,640
A little in love.

539
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,640
Here the next thing you know you're out by and a ring.

540
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,640
A man's got to be strong and I'm trying to hold on.

541
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,640
But be in that tough thrill, too.

542
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,640
Because I'm all about her.

543
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,640
One thing's for sure.

544
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,640
I'm just a little in love.

545
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
Here the things rose.

546
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,640
Neighbors getting notes.

547
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,640
She's been over three times this week.

548
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,640
Every time I see her,

549
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,640
I'm thinking that I must be.

550
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,640
A little in love.

551
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Something tell me there's no such thing.

552
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,640
A little in love.

553
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,640
And the next thing you know you're out by and a ring.

554
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,640
A man's got to be strong and I'm trying to hold on.

555
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,640
But be in that tub's real time

556
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,640

00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,640

And I'm just a little in love

559
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,640
Well I guess it sounds crazy

560
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,640
It's too late to save me

561
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,640
I know there I know her

562
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,640
So I must look funny

563
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640

A little in love

568
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,640
And the next thing you know you're out behind a ring

569
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,640
A man's gotta be strong

570
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,640
And I'm trying to hold on

571
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,640
