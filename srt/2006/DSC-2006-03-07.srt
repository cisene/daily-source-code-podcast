1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Delta Sierra Charley, 3-4-8.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,520
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,520
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,520
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,520
How can you love me when you don't know who I am?

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,520
These pages got a lot more thin from the bloodstained dirty hand.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,520
And all I know is I was blinded as beautiful as mighty graze.

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,520
I've been a white devil, a holy roller.

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,520
The ball can not stand alone with the temperature.

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,520
So I just keep wasting the time again and again.

11
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,520
I've been accused of the crime that came from this.

12
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,520
My baby loves me, gives me everything I need.

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,520
She'll make a crown out of art, why?

14
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,520
And I'm happy just to bleed.

15
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,520
She knows that I've been trying hard to take my leave.

16
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,520
She likes guns and she makes love like a lion.

17
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,520
There's blood and I quote it in the other song as a TV.

18
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,520
I'm wasting my time again and again.

19
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,520
Oh yeah.

20
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,520
I've been accused of the crime, but inside it will spin.

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,520
No one ever told me they would only like to move down with the pins of needles and standing away.

22
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,520
Oh yeah.

23
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,520
Everybody told me I'll be just fine, but it's my time to break that bitter white.

24
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Nobody loves you, we'll rest, you get it by.

25
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:24,520
I won't keep wasting the time again and again.

26
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,520
I've been accused of the crime, but inside it will spin.

27
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,520
I can't so use that these crimes, but it wears kind of this.

28
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:46,520
I won't keep wasting the time again and again.

29
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,520
When I'm with it, I'll be just fine.

30
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,520
I've been accused of the crime, but inside it will spin.

31
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,520
Oh yeah.

32
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:09,520
I won't keep wasting my time again and again.

33
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Oh yeah.

34
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,520
I've been accused of the crime, but inside it will spin.

35
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:35,520
Just wasted my time, I keep it under my skin, take it home Matthew, man, I gotta get

36
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:42,520
down the Nashville again, Matthew Ebal, I'd be the Nashville actually, I remember what

37
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:49,320
I do there, did some appearance, what is it to peer or the harborside or river side or something

38
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:55,480
like that, for some top 40 station, I remember Christy Canyon was there during that particular

39
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,240
appearance, Christy Canyon, the porn star, I guess my illustrious past, just looking at the

40
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:07,720
pod save music network page from Matthew Ebal, you could easily be, you could be Matt

41
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,320
Dylan's brother, you know, if you take away the go-tee maybe, you know, he has kind of

42
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,120
that same shape head, who cares, everybody how you're doing, it's Tuesday coming to you

43
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,560
from the cottage today's crap, otherwise it's rainy, if it were any colder than we would

44
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,400
be seeing snow without a doubt, so I guess that's kind of good, most of continental Europe

45
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,120
has seen plenty of snow in the past few days, oh, there I go again, one day I'll actually remember

46
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,000
to start the show and remove the blackberry from my pocket as I do it.

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,840
Hey plenty of stuff to go through today, the conversation just keep on continuing, people responding

48
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:51,400
to previous shows from yesterday, from last week Andrew Spettings says, Adam, I'm all on my own,

49
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,480
I'm listening to your show for over a year now and love it when I talk to people that

50
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,600
work about podcasts, they look at me as if I'm out to lunch, all I can say is their loss

51
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:07,400
No, no, no, no, no, this is your job, man, this is where you've got to look burn a show

52
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,360
onto a CD for them, send them to dailysourcecode.com, let them click on a link, send them to

53
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,800
podshow.com, hunt around, go to podcast alley, podcast people, don't send them the iTunes

54
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,800
necessarily because that's where people will start to fall off the edge and also that's where

55
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,800
it's confusing, you know, do you need an iPod, you need all this stuff, so just send them a link,

56
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,440
man, just email somebody a link and say listen to this and make sure it's something that is

57
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:36,360
tuned for them that you think they're like, he winds up by saying, I agree with you, you're a

58
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:43,480
view of Callie from Geek Brief TV, go, hmm, yep, Callie and I are going to be doing some stuff

59
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,080
together in San Francisco, my next trip, which I guess is going to be, I guess next week,

60
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,000
but the girls and I are going to go away for the weekend, I'll be telling you about that on Friday

61
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,640
and we got some fun stuff planned, which would be great, the three of us staying in a hotel,

62
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:05,400
two separate rooms, yeah, and then Monday, we come back Tuesday, oh, maybe I'll even leave Tuesday,

63
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,920
shoot, I don't know, it's going to be another 10-day stamp, that's for sure.

64
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,640
A very long email, which I won't read in its entirety, but I just love the opening from Paul

65
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,760
Russelling. Hey Adam, enjoy the podcast when I find time. It's an interesting views angles

66
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,080
I was astounded last week when I discovered that your Patricia is in fact the lady whose voice

67
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:31,080
I kind of fell in love with back in the late 60s as the begiling voice of the skull beer commercial

68
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:37,800
played on radio Veronica. Later she did a couple of wonderful jingles like sailing the moon line with

69
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:46,760
Veronica, she should do that. I shouldn't be doing that. Let's see, and so on, over what must have

70
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,800
been in one of the first lifts of a commercial singles as the backing track. That's right,

71
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,560
it was no dusty spring field beside the summer is over. Those are still some of my favorite

72
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,040
radio jingles and believe me, I must have heard thousands and remakes quite a lot for various

73
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,200
radio stations I've been involved with. And it just goes on and on and on. I mean, he's he's back

74
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,560
from the the Miyamigo days. Oh, actually, this is kind of funny. He was on the radio himself.

75
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,680
Remember we talked about flicker, the service, and how that name means something different in

76
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,040
in Dutch? He said, well, I was back in the crazy days of Miyamigo, which was another

77
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,240
pirate radio station, actually on the high seas, on the North Sea broadcasting from a ship,

78
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,280
medium wave only, which was the shit back in the 70s. I was an unknown looking for an

79
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,680
interesting name with a good hook. My real name was unsuitable, and we were all supposed to have a

80
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,520
new name. Isn't that crazy? By the way, how this joke is used to change their names. I've never done that.

81
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,560
Oh, actually, I'm sorry. I have a decibel radio. That's true. But this seems like I got paid for

82
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,160
my own name. One of my Dutch colleagues suggested flicker. I thought, good idea. A one word name,

83
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,880
like Roscoe, and we can have flicker stickers, and maybe even flicker knickers. So, right in

84
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,520
early the next morning, six a.m. I hit the air with a new name. Your DJ flicker. I was on the

85
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,200
English service of radio Carolina at the time. We had two transmitters, one Dutch one English,

86
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,680
but we still did some links in Dutch to make matters worse. I'm identifying as a Dutch DJ,

87
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,600
did is you knew an English style of DJ, your flicker. So basically it was DJ Fag, what he was saying,

88
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:19,240
Dutch. Ah, the days when we used to play nasty pranks on each other at the radio station. Sometimes,

89
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,680
sometimes, just a little bit, a little bit I long for those days. Hi Adam. It's a Simon here from

90
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,760
the Chintware Podcast, which is at www.chimware.org. I'm calling you from Bath in the United Kingdom,

91
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:36,760
and I just want to say a few things. Firstly, with the court case, I'm wishing you were the best

92
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:42,200
of luck and court case. You're obviously in the right morally physically mentally, socially,

93
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:48,040
psychopathically, I don't know, but anyway, choose two of the all the above. Definitely the right.

94
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,200
So, good luck with that. Secondly, for many reasons why I'm calling is that there's problems with

95
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:01,960
the podcast alley, the podcast marketing system. My podcast, Chimware. I'm trying to get my friends

96
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,000
to vote for it for obvious reasons, and it seems that some of my friends who have hotmail accounts,

97
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,000
which is the worst account ever, but some of them do. I can't vote for it, because I think podcast

98
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:21,320
alley has been blacklisted. I just thought I thought that like he wants to know because the

99
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:28,120
votes aren't being counted for people with hotmail accounts, which is the majority of my friends,

100
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:35,480
so my podcast only has two votes, which is my hand, one of my other G-well friends. So that's

101
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,840
all I wanted to call about. I can't think of anything else. Good luck with the case. Great show.

102
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:49,880
Keep it up. Love the Charlie, and Tata. Tata. To the pit. Right, court case, judgment day.

103
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:55,240
Thursday, March 9th, we'll hear what the judge says. I just get butterflies in my stomach thinking

104
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,480
about it. So this is, it's kind of four to it. It's how this has all come together where we're

105
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:06,200
learning about this whitelist, blacklist stuff, and the incredibly unfriendly email tax that I

106
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,720
believe AOL is going to, they say they're going to start it next month, is going to put on emails,

107
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,120
which is not a spam protection for you. It's just guaranteeing the spammers that the spam will get

108
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,800
through. And when I say spammers, you know, I basically mean marketers who call your name from

109
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:28,280
somewhere and send it on through. And we find found this out quite by accident, although I have

110
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,960
a feeling that I do recall Chris McIntyre mentioning this to me months and months and months ago about

111
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,920
the email registrations. And yes, it is indeed a problem. And hotmail is the biggest offender. Again,

112
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:46,200
hotmail and MSN both blacklist all kinds of email, and they will send you to a different company,

113
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,160
a third party, which they use exclusively to have this stuff solved, which costs money.

114
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,520
I should really look into the ownership of that company and find out if there's any,

115
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,760
to any ownership by Microsoft. Anyone can check that out, that'll be, that'll be really cool.

116
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,840
But this is really the multi-tiered internet, even in today's financial times, there was an article

117
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:10,680
about it where AT&T, who was about to buy, who were about to buy Bell, South, I believe,

118
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:18,360
are now saying, hey, you know, we're going to charge content companies to have content travel over

119
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,640
our network with any decent speed. So they're talking really about building a second internet next

120
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:30,920
to the original one. And I think that, obviously, I think this is a really bad precedent.

121
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,480
I believe that it's charging, it's kind of like having your cake and eating it too. And there's

122
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,320
been lots of feedback about it. Hey Adam, how's it going? I cannot believe this deal that they're

123
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:48,040
talking about where you're going to have two different tiers of internet provider. I mean,

124
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,720
I pay for my internet connectivity. It doesn't just fall out of the sky. So I have my 50,

125
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,440
60 bucks a month goes out there. And I expect to be able to get what I'm paying for. I paid to be

126
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,880
able to go to Google. I paid to be able to go to Yahoo. I paid to be able to go to, well,

127
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:12,040
I'm not going to mention that site. But how can they then say, yeah, you're paying for connectivity,

128
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,800
but Google didn't pay us two, so we're not going to deliver to you. Now let's take the other side of it.

129
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:25,320
Google paid for circuits to get on to the internet. Probably pretty damn big circuits.

130
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,320
Now they're going to tell them, yeah, you bought the fat pipe and you are a big part of the internet,

131
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:38,920
but we want more money because people are actually using your pipes. Google can't put anything

132
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:46,120
more on the internet than they have pipes to feed it with. And they had to buy those pipes

133
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:53,080
from someone. If they got a DS3 hooked up to the internet, then they can't be feeding any more

134
00:12:53,080 --> 00:13:00,440
than a DS3 was of content out there, which they bought. If I have six megabit down from the

135
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,040
internet, I can't get more than six megabit, which is what I paid for. Just like on my end,

136
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,480
if I didn't pay for large bandwidth downloads, then I would have a slower connection. But I would

137
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:17,480
pay less. I don't understand how and who they're going to charge more to. Are they going to

138
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,960
come to me and say, hey, if you want fast connection, here's the speed. And if you want fast connection

139
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:29,400
with content, here's the premium above and beyond that. And are they going to go to Google and

140
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,000
say, hey, you want fast connection to the internet, here's the price. But if you actually put anything

141
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,120
on the pipe, we're going to charge you extra. Maybe what we should do is we should vote with

142
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:47,480
our dollars, like you say, but in a different way. Form a group that says, I will only buy

143
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:54,600
internet connectivity from an unrestricted single tier provider. And Google should go to their

144
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,560
current provider and say, hey, you know, we spend a lot of money with you guys. And we're going

145
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:06,040
to stop doing that. If in any way, our content will be restricted by anyone else on the internet.

146
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,440
That would make the people that want to bully everybody into the multiple tier network,

147
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,960
instantly irrelevant. They would be other charging for their restricted network and everybody else

148
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:21,880
would be paying less for the unrestricted network. Just a quick thought in what I know is a utopian

149
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:28,120
world in my mind. But I don't know. I don't like the idea of destroying the money at the politicians

150
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,600
and hoping that they'll take care of it. I'd rather vote with my dollars myself. So I guess everyone

151
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:39,960
should hurry up and head over to www.bukaidrivetime.com to listen to the Bukai Drive Time podcast

152
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:46,520
before it gets too popular. And you have to pay extra because it doesn't suck. I don't understand.

153
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,400
Well, Adam, I'm not a pilot, so I can't wish you to go wins, but in the current environment,

154
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,480
I think it's going to make more and more sense for us to look at each other and wish each other,

155
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:05,080
single tiered bandwidth, lighter and keep it Ruby. Yeah, okay. So what AT&T and also what AOL are doing,

156
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,640
this is two different coins, two different sides of the coin here, or really all different

157
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:15,960
sides of the cube of the equation of multi-tiered internet. It is, of course, part of the American

158
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:23,080
system. It's privatized. AT&T has the right to charge whatever they think they can get away with,

159
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:31,320
I guess. There's a very interesting article on muniwireless.com, muniwireless, my uniform November

160
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:42,440
India wireless.com, which claims that the $200 billion that was invested in creating the, or that

161
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,920
was supposed to create the broadband infrastructure that we have today actually came from taxpayers

162
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:53,640
from tax breaks and incentives for the telcos at in the dot com boom. I'm not quite sure

163
00:15:53,640 --> 00:16:01,000
about the legitimacy of that, although I don't, I read wireless, a muniwireless a lot and they

164
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,720
seem to be pretty much on the up and up, but at the end of the day, it comes down to us to the

165
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:13,800
consumers. And, you know, if we sit at, I mean, so yeah, there's DRAOL dot com, and I'm sure there

166
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:20,440
will be similar types of websites that we can express our outrage, but it really doesn't make any

167
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,160
difference. I mean, look at the, look at gas pump prices, and then look at what kind of profits,

168
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:30,440
the oil companies have made in the past few years. I mean, it's been astronomical. And we continue.

169
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,000
Well, actually, it's getting better, I have to say. We're switching on to biodiesel, we're switching

170
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,200
on to electric cars. This is not about, for me, personally, although it's nice if, as a bonus,

171
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:48,120
we also save the environment. But you use your pocketbook, man. Use your pocketbook to vote for

172
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,960
what you really want and, and leave AT&T. I don't think you need AT&T for anything anymore. Do you need it

173
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:59,640
for, um, for telephony? No, you can get that from your cable provider. You can get it from different

174
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,120
broadband providers. So, you know, you can get your internet from them and you can get your television

175
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:10,600
from them. I think we, hello, dear. It's the, oh, what is this, huh? You're a little early.

176
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,240
Thank you. What do we have? What do we have on the, uh, on the menu today? We have

177
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,560
come a little closer. Something, um, what? Well, not so healthy today. Oh, very good. What is it?

178
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:30,600
Well, what is it? Well, it's Dutch. Yeah, but it's warm. It's warm. Yeah, but you're, the timing's all

179
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:37,080
are fun. I know, but I have to go. I know, but I'm in, you're long, sorry. Getting from the microphone,

180
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,520
if you're going to talk, please, I hate to just hear it. You don't make you a lunch. You don't eat.

181
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,520
Yes, this is true. So, and I have to go. I'm going to the center. Okay. Oh, you're for it.

182
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,320
To the center. To the center. Be careful for people stopping following you. You know,

183
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,840
Roger Smalls is out there. Oh, yeah. And, uh, and I was thinking, I think, well, I'm going to

184
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,400
make him lunch because if I don't do that, I don't eat. I'll come back at four, five and I said,

185
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,760
did you eat something? Uh, no, I forgot. I mean, that's not good. So, that's why.

186
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:14,120
Okay. Thank you, huh? You are my princess. Oh, thank you. My prince. Yes. Okay, baby. Okay. I'll

187
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:21,720
eat it during a comic strip blogger. Yeah. All right. I love you. Oh. So, vote with your pocket

188
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,760
book for Christ's sakes. I got to talk to earth link and see what their policy is on on all that stuff.

189
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,400
You're just, oh, man. It's, it's, it's, it's nuts. But, you know, the, the press is catching

190
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,560
on to it. That's really good. And we can put them under pressure by walking away. That's really what

191
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,000
you need to do. We need to have a list of, of, uh, internet providers that won't be charging

192
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,760
a premium content. And, and of course, there's going to be some because that too is the American way.

193
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:52,280
So, uh, former, he'll staffer, uh, Thomas says, Adam, this is actually on the comments, uh, at

194
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,640
curry.com, uh, former he'll staffer devoted D.A.C. listener here to become active. It's best to

195
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,520
tell listeners to contact their own senators and urge them to co-sponsored the bill. Well,

196
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,880
widen may appreciate the support. If you call it his office, his staffers are busy

197
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:11,640
and have taken care of people from Oregon. So, you have to go and call, um, your representative.

198
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:18,840
After a quick search of, uh, Thomas.loc.gov, I don't see a house companion bill. So, finding a house

199
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:24,680
sponsor is the place to start. While AT&T has been a major contributor to Republican, a representative

200
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:31,160
boosher, B-O-U-S-C-H-E-R. It's possible. He may be willing to sponsor a house version.

201
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,960
Uh, he's usually very good on tech issues. Only time will tell. All right. And then we got another one from,

202
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,320
it's from Jay Barker, uh, says you asked them today's show that was yesterday.

203
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,800
Best way to support Senator Ron Wyden and the internet non-discrimination act. Really the best

204
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,760
thing any legislator can hear is feedback from his constituents. I keep the phone number for the

205
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,240
U.S. Capitol switchboard in my cell phone. I'm a student. So, wherever I'm between classes, I take

206
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:01,240
three minutes to call, ask for my Senator or rep and leave a message to the effect of hi. My name

207
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:08,520
is blank. I'm a voter from blank. I would like Senator, uh, uh, or representative. So, and so to vote,

208
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:14,280
yes, or no, on blank. It helps to know the bill number, but it's just as easy to describe the bill.

209
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:23,080
So, the main number for the house and the Senate is 202-224-3121. Oh, what I love about podcasting.

210
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,360
You don't have to repeat those numbers. You just pause it, skip back and you can write it down.

211
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:32,920
The internet non-discrimination act of 2006 is bill number. Estes in Sierra, 288,

212
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:38,680
India, Sierra, and is sponsored by Representative Chris Cox and Senator Ron Wyden.

213
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:45,160
And I'm going to do that myself. I was going to do it on Skype on the show today, but everything

214
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:55,640
broke as usual. Last night, Patricia and I watched a recorded the Academy Awards on Sky Digital,

215
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:03,720
which is the equivalent of, of Tvoing in, I guess. And, uh, I was disappointed. You know, I mean,

216
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,720
I think it's really come down to, you know, the fact that all we really want to see is

217
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,400
beautiful, guys and girls, beautiful dresses, beautiful attire, some funny jokes. And by the way,

218
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,760
where was all the political stuff? You know, you know, George Clooney, if you have 100, as, as the

219
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,640
show claims, hundreds and hundreds of millions of people watching, what's not an opportunity to say

220
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,040
something? I really didn't miss that. I missed a little bit of the controversy. Good, you know,

221
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,600
I thought John Stuart did a good job, you know, it's, uh, it's not easy doing that.

222
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,920
And, uh, it was obvious the audience who was kind of tough to, to get him on board, but, uh,

223
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,040
I known John for a long, long time and I thought it was pretty cool what he did.

224
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:04,680
Higher than Kerry. Fuck you very much for the partial and incomplete answer to my questions.

225
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,720
Regarding your question, well, I had been unloferably dismissed by finished fucking bastards,

226
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:18,440
because I was blocking about mobile phones, all mobile phones. Please note that I was

227
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:27,240
blocking about mobile phones since year 1996, it means one year before the term block or web block

228
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:34,120
was coined in year 1997. In other words, I was blocking about mobile phones.

229
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:42,520
Long before I came to Finland, which is the Bum Hall of the whole world. Unfortunately, a couple

230
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:50,760
of years after my arrival to Finland, one of my blogs, the one with dot info in internet domain name,

231
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:59,800
achieved Google Painter 7, Google Painter 7, what was very high then, and this finished

232
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:06,360
drunkards couldn't stand that I was blocking about all mobile phones and not just

233
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:14,120
their mobile phones. Anyway, this is a long story that involves industrial espionage that

234
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:21,240
industry practices, even with use of threats and Viagra, and certainly I will not tell you

235
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:31,080
it publicly on the podcast. Yes, nowadays I am a fan of Windows Mobile phones, and now this is simply

236
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:38,680
the best platform for smartphones. Windows Mobile is the best platform for smartphones. And as

237
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:48,920
example of palm shows, palm uses this platform in their latest phone palm trio 700W

238
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:56,760
that is available now on Verizon Wireless in USA. I also don't agree that my comments on your

239
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:04,200
block were one sided and all the same, because I was commenting about different issues, various

240
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:11,640
several different issues, not just those mentioned in my former audio comment. Anyway, let's

241
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:20,280
wait till this fucking Thursday, and let's see what this Dutch batch, I'm sorry, let's see what

242
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:28,280
this Honorebo Dutch Dutch will tell. So, fuck you later, podcast creator. Oh, coming through

243
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:34,920
blogger, man, that is just poetry. Thank you so much. I just left a little pause there because

244
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:41,000
the satellite window closed, nothing left nothing left to say. People on the satellite, what the hell was

245
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,160
that? You know, comic strip blogger, this is very interesting. Okay, so I guess you worked at no

246
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:52,840
here, if I understand correctly, and you kept a blog, the way before the word blog was even popular,

247
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:59,400
apparently, you'd seem to be the inventor of the web blog. And you were blogging about all mobile

248
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:06,600
phones. Now, I can understand from nochias perspective, which is, you know, definitely an older

249
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,920
school, not old school, but an older school type of company that they wouldn't appreciate that. You

250
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:18,120
blogging about, excuse me, yeah, you know what I want to say. You know, you blogging about

251
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,400
all types of mobile platforms. I can understand what they, they have control issues about that.

252
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,560
And so, apparently, they, I guess you fell out or they fired you or you left or whatever,

253
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,320
you're no longer in Finland, then you went to Germany, I believe. What I'd really like to know

254
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,680
comic strip blogger is, what is your vocation? What do you do? What is your skill set? And,

255
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:45,240
you know, what did you do at Nokia? And what are you doing now? You seem to have an awful lot of

256
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,440
time on your hands. So, very, very curious is to, as to what skillset you have. And,

257
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,200
perhaps we can put that to, to great use right here on the source code. You know, could

258
00:25:54,280 --> 00:26:01,640
Metro, Metro, Metro, Metro, Metro, Metro, Metro, Metro, Metro,

259
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,240
Metro, Metro, it's Alan Curry's Metro sexual moment. She did it up now.

260
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:13,960
Alan Curry's Metro sexual moment. Hey mate, says Phil Walker, funniest thing happened last week.

261
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,400
I was on a flight from Ken Barra to Sydney and I just sat down on my seat and plugged in the iPod to

262
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:24,280
listen to my daily Charlie. As I look out the window, I saw a virgin blue. That's the Aussie

263
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:31,560
Virgin of Virgin Atlantic. A virgin blue 737 taxi in the 737 was in a livery, I had a livery.

264
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,160
I hadn't seen before. It was covered in a Gillette advertisement for the M3 Shaveer.

265
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,400
See this link for a picture of the aircraft. I'll be sure to post that in the show note.

266
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,600
So, there I was listening to the Charlie on my iPod looking at a virgin 737 with Gillette

267
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,400
M3 advertising. I just had to laugh out loud. If only they'd served up some Simpsons and say,

268
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:58,600
oh my flight. Phil, love the picture. And you know, what is that with all those brands coming together?

269
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,200
Perhaps there's some larger evil plan that I haven't told you about?

270
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,000
See this is the only problem I have with cast blasters. I can't control the sounds on everything.

271
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,360
Okay, let's try again. Hello Adam. Leo Vgo de He, calling from a beautifully sunny

272
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:24,040
Brisbane in Queensland, the Sunshine State. I was talking to an Australian colleague about matters

273
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:28,440
Metro sexual, a couple of evenings ago, when the changing no microchill came up.

274
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,520
First it was Metro sexual and then Uber sexual, but what was the word to use in 2006?

275
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:41,720
Straight away he came back with her mafredude. It's not the most flattering term I think you'll agree,

276
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,440
but a fun one nonetheless. I'm not convinced you should rename the Metro sexual moment

277
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,320
section of the show though. Have a great day.

278
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,800
Really got to work on that show.

279
00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:01,560
Metro sexual. Metro sexual. It's an increased Metro sexual moment.

280
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,120
An increased Metro sexual moment.

281
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:15,480
Christian. Christian. Unbehound. I think it is Christian unbehound. Adam, for those of your listeners

282
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,280
who are uncertain about how to shave well and do everything okay in front of the mirror,

283
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,440
wouldn't it be cool to let them listen to your Metro sexual moment also in their bathroom

284
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,480
and get the latest tricks from you while they're shaving at the same time?

285
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,920
Because here is the gadget everybody needs for his perfect shave. Yes, it's pretty much a shaving

286
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,880
mirror with built-in stereo speakers and a slot for holding your iPod. Something nobody really

287
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,840
needs but gives you the right feeling for truly being a Metro sexual guy. By the way,

288
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,560
is the Metro sexual moment song from Jeff also available for download my wife and children

289
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:52,760
are really loving it. Can't stop listening to it. Christian, that dude. Come on.

290
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,640
I don't think Jeff has made it available for download. I don't know if many people have actually

291
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,440
requested that maybe you should make up some more words to it and we could turn it into an

292
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,360
overnight sensation here today. Good morning Adam. This is your friend Ralph.

293
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,640
Otherwise, no, no, no, no. Skip G. I have no podcasts. I have no podcasts with nerd.

294
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:20,680
For your Metro sexual moment, I would like to recommend a Zeno moisturizing bar. It has natural

295
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:27,960
coil oatmeal, it has no soap, it has no fragrance, it has nothing but soap and it will

296
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:35,000
keep your skin clean. Don't like it. You don't need all those other products. This is the answer.

297
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,200
I've been using it since I was a child and now I'm in my, what should I say? It's a

298
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,520
decade and I don't have it again as smooth as a baby's out.

299
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,280
And could be Metro sexual moment.

300
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:57,400
Hey Adam, this is Dave Jackson. You might know me from the school podcasting.com or the musician's

301
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:03,800
core but this past weekend. Oh my, I launched another podcast and this one's called The Best of the

302
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,560
Words. Now, we are going to have a lot of fun at this site. There's going to be voting

303
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:12,520
and of course, there'll be an RSS feed for listeners, but there's going to be an additional RSS feed.

304
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:17,320
And this feed is going to have two minute segments of Best of the Words featuring content

305
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:23,160
four podcasters that they can play in their very own show. So a podcaster specific feed

306
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:29,240
in addition to the listener feed. Now, what is Best of the Words Podcast? Check out this promo.

307
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:35,240
Hey, who doesn't love a parade? The big marching bands, the dazzling major reds, the funny

308
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:41,240
clowns and the beautiful floats. And after all those wonderful entertainers, there's that one

309
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:49,560
guy at the end of the parade cleaning up the horseshit. Well, that man is me. I'm Dave Jackson

310
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,840
and I want you to join me every week as I bring you the Best of the Words bands at the

311
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:59,160
Podsafe Music Network. It just because you suck doesn't mean you don't deserve a little

312
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:04,600
exposure. But after all, one of the best episodes of American Idol, those weeks were those creepy,

313
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:11,640
crazy toned-up people do their best and it's the worst. So join me at Best of the Words Podcast.com

314
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,440
and help us pick the best of the worst. By the end of the show, you'll wish you were deaf.

315
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,640
Adam Curry for us. Yeah. He spends a lot of time over there and his little cottage. He does

316
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,640
English manner. Mm-hmm. Well, you've got a little bit of a look on your face right now.

317
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:44,360
Is there something that you want to share? Well, this week, I've got a little thing for Adam Curry.

318
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,840
I don't know. That's all right. I assume our listeners listen to Adam Curry and we know he

319
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,880
listens to us a little bit. We'd like to give Michelle out for playing our ad a couple of times.

320
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:03,320
Yes. Yeah. Thanks, Adam. And you know, I've Google imaged him and he's cute. I guess I'm changing

321
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,560
the subject here. That's fine. Harden me if I seem flustered. I'm thinking about Googling. Are you

322
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:12,760
diverting from lip gloss to laptops right now? I am. We're into the laptop section. All right. A

323
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:19,640
Google imaged Adam Curry. So you Google imaged? I like when he says things like wing commander.

324
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:26,520
And Sierra Echo X-ray Yankee. He starts talking like that. Right. What is that? You know?

325
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:39,000
What is it? See Sierra? Sierra Echo X-ray Yankee. It means sexy. So you're naughty. He is the same age

326
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:46,680
as Hank Azaria, too. Really? They're both 41. I think, or 42. Anyway, you know what? My husband's listening.

327
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:53,960
I had a change in sub-john wine. Yeah. Maybe one day we'll have to get into, you know, things that

328
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:02,760
I enjoy. Oh, yeah. But not today. No? No. No. So sure make me seem like the freak. Okay, let's go on

329
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:13,000
to mascara again. Lip gloss and laptops.com. So what is the Buckeye Drive Time Podcast? It's probably

330
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,400
easier to talk about what the Buckeye Drive Time Podcast doesn't have. I don't have an open

331
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,680
microphone while I'm playing a novelty song so that everybody can laugh in the studio and let

332
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:29,640
you know that it's supposed to be funny. I don't have an intern that I send out into the world to

333
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:35,720
publicly humiliate by wearing a costume or asking ridiculous questions of pastors by. I don't

334
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:42,280
have any hookers or escorts or strippers in the studio. Joy said no. But you do get a quick Ohio

335
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:47,800
moment of fact or a piece of information about the center of the universe. Occasionally sports

336
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:54,120
from my castredale, three pods saved songs, and three podcast promotions. And something else

337
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:59,080
here and there when I feel like throwing it in. At the end of your drive, you should feel like you've

338
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,040
had fun, been entertained, or a little bit more intelligent. The idea is to be an alternative

339
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:10,120
to the regular morning zoo-type drive time. That clear channel has been pushing on you for years.

So check us out at www.bukaidrivetime.com. And if you like what you hear, go ahead and subscribe.

341
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,360
And we'll do our best to help you keep it groovy. I hope you didn't mind all the promo's

342
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:27,240
one after another. I had to eat those hot dogs, man. They were getting cold. Oh, so good.

343
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:34,040
Just use me. That was disgusting. Just one thing about the the Oscars. I was just reading

344
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:39,880
them through the promos and through my hot dog. The ratings were down about 8% compared to

345
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:49,640
last year. Excuse me. But John Stewart did bring 5% more males 18 to 34. That's so crazy the way.

346
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,360
You know, the way they measure all that stuff and they talk in such abstracts. I was just disappointed

347
00:34:54,360 --> 00:35:00,680
by the show. I really was. It's just like, okay, you know, the best. Yeah, that really was no best moment,

348
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:06,680
actually. It's just it seems so blah. I'm just jaded or whatever it is. There's just so much more

349
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,280
exciting stuff that I can spend my time on. Three hours of watching that stuff.

350
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,880
We've got a few more pieces of feedback. I want to talk about the pot set music network because

351
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,280
it got a lot of comments about it. Good and bad. So I want to make sure we get to get everything in

352
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:27,080
there. And some comments from for all. Hi, this is Annie Grubins. We podcast listeners here.

353
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:33,000
No, Germany. Have started a little campaign to find a logo for our hobby. By wearing this

354
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:39,080
logo as a sticker or a button, we want to show others that we listen to podcasts and make podcasting

355
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:45,800
more popular. My listeners have come up with 94 different graphics. And now we are looking

356
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:52,680
first for the top 10 and then for the winning logo. Please feel free to take the poll 2 at podcast

357
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:58,440
logo.com. Thank you very much. I'm very curious about the results. You know, I actually looked at

358
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,520
that and there's a whole bunch of really nice logos. There's a couple of them I'd want to use.

359
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,920
Yeah, you know, I think that's a pretty good initiative. Germany is popping wide open by the way

360
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,640
on the podcast front. And I do have a French, a French feedback, but I'll play that one tomorrow.

361
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:19,160
Somehow I got the the file misplaced or something. Podcast logo. Was it podcast logo dot

362
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:25,400
dot com? Was it or dot dot shoot? Look in the show notes and I'll get all that info back to you.

363
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,640
We're living here a bit longer than you have though. I originally came over for a six months of

364
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:45,080
work contract back in 1986. So I've been here for almost 20 years now. I do still spend quite a

365
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:49,000
lot of time in Holland though because over the last few years most of my work's been in Amsterdam

366
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,720
in Ethiopia. So I spent most of the year easy jetting out at 6 a.m. on Monday morning from

367
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:59,640
late in the Tuesday, and back from tomorrow to late in the 1815 on Friday afternoon. As quite a few

368
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:04,120
other people do as well, surprisingly. But I'm not doing these as yet commuted moment because

369
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:09,560
some are necessarily in between contracts. Although I'll be popping over to Amsterdam again

370
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,800
later this week for a few days. And it was over there that I discovered since a few years back

371
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:19,400
him got totally hooked on that. So I'd like to make a few comments on the T-pad as you

372
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:25,880
discussed in the Charlie 346. You're seeing deed that sounds totally disgusting and in two ways

373
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,960
even. First of all, you'd never want to make a petite machine that has just produced coffee.

374
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,720
It would not taste good. Or vice versa for that matter. Suppose we don't work if we actually have

375
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:40,440
two machines. One for coffee and one for tea. Now luckily I haven't had three of the little bastards,

376
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:46,280
but that's a difference story. Secondly, I know they're called pants in Holland and most of the

377
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:51,320
rest of Europe. But if you care to pick a pack of them in a UK supermarket and look at the packaging,

378
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:57,320
you'll see that they're not called pads in the UK. Pads would not be good. Just imagine.

379
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,200
Somebody's saying, honey, can you get me some pads when you go to supermarket? You don't come

380
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:09,480
back with the wrong thing. No, in the UK, they're actually called pods. Not pads. So I guess before

381
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:14,040
you start recording a show, you put a pod in your sensei or machine and make yourself a glorious

382
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,720
cup of coffee. That means your sensei or driven audio show is a pod cast in more than one way.

383
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:28,200
I'm at Finne Looker Closer. Funny, huh? Our one common common people separated by a common

384
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:35,000
language. Yeah, I guess the pads thing is kind of a mistake. David Groves sent me an email and said,

385
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:43,320
you know, I've just, my girlfriend, was it? I don't know how to read that whole thing. The whole

386
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:50,120
point is he's saying that people who come into the daily source code who are newbies probably don't

387
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,800
understand a whole bunch of things you're talking about. And even though I do try to reiterate

388
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:59,160
very briefly before I start off on a rant or a story, it seems that the the main things that are,

389
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:04,680
you know, that need some explanation or that we need an FAQ or a cheese would be great to have an

390
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:09,480
audio FAQ, wouldn't it? I got to think about that. So some of the subjects that David would like

391
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:14,600
explain the detail is I guess the genesis behind Trinity. What is biodiesel Delta Sierra is this

392
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:19,800
your plane, Roger Smolls. Yeah, that's that that needs his own FAQ. You're American who lived in

393
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,520
Netherlands, married a pop star now living between Gilford and San Francisco. Yes, correct. All of it's all right.

394
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,520
We'll do a Trinity segment later on this week and talk about that as in biodiesel. Delta

395
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:35,160
Sierra isn't the plane and it's almost done. I got an email from the guy in Rotterdam who's doing

396
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:40,520
the Reopholstery. Both seats are done. The carpeting is done. The side panels and the doors are

397
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:48,200
done. Now the back seat is the last thing he has to do. I've booked a round trip easy jet for the

398
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,160
three of us to come back on Monday, but with a little bit of luck, we might actually be able to

399
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:58,200
fly back in the Delta Sierra. And yes, it's the reason I call it that is because the call sign is

400
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:04,520
November 277 Delta Sierra. Hey Adam, it's Rob Uston from the Jersey Jamcast. I wanted to throw a

401
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:09,480
quick comment out to you about downloading music from the positive music network and ID3 tags.

402
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:15,560
A lot of times I download a couple of tracks from the PMN for my show. I pop them into iTunes and there's

403
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:23,640
no ID3 tag info. It's just using the file name in the song title selection. It's kind of

404
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:28,360
convenient because then I got to go back and see what song is by what artists. I might do a couple

405
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:33,720
songs and then I have to go into the info manually, which is not that big of a deal for

406
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:39,320
me as a podcast or other podcast. It's kind of a minor inconvenience, but once you start selling

407
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:43,800
music on the podcast music network, it's going to be an issue. It's got to be seamless so that when

408
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:49,480
somebody buys a song and puts it into iTunes or whatever program they use, the ID3 info has

409
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,600
got to be there or else they're going to end up really frustrated. So if there's a way you can put

410
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,960
a reminder up for the artists on whatever page they upload songs from, I think that would be good

411
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,680
or maybe there's a way you can have the pod safe music network alter the ID3 when they upload the

412
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:09,640
song with maybe some info that they might enter on a page and as they're uploading the song,

413
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:16,120
it'll alter the MP3 and put in the ID3 tag info that they want. That would be really good.

414
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:20,040
So hopefully there's a solution, but it's definitely something you got to look at.

415
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:27,640
And if you haven't checked out my show, come on by. It's the Jersey Jamcast, which is Jerseyjamcast.plogspot.com.

00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,960
I play the best music coming out of New Jersey and I'll tell you there's hell of a lot of good stuff

417
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:37,720
so come on by and any bands that I play that aren't on the pod safe music network. I'm trying

418
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:43,320
to get them up on the pod safe music network and hopefully we'll get to more bands involved.

419
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,720
So all right, take care Adam. Yeah, good point. Yeah, thank you, we did Jersey Jamcast. Yeah,

420
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,120
very good point. And we've talked about that. I talked about this with comments and promos and feedback

421
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:59,560
all the time as well. Please. What is wrong with me? Use those ID3 tags. And I disagree with you

422
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:05,320
that once we start selling, no, no, no, this is an unlabel. This is not a music story. It is not

423
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:10,280
iTunes music store because in a store things are closed off locked off. There's only one door in

424
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:16,120
a maybe a service entrance and there's certain ways you have to do stuff and you can look

425
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:21,720
but you can't touch in the store. In the unlabel concept, the artist is responsible. This is where

426
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,320
I believe we're taking the record company out of the equation. Record companies do all this

427
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:32,520
stuff for the artist. Now, if you are a completely introverted out of your mind,

428
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:38,040
whacked out musical genius who can't find the the interest to make sure that your stuff

429
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:42,760
is marketed correctly, then find a friend who will, okay? And and work out some arrangement with

430
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:48,360
them. I would I would strongly advise against a record contract, certainly a mainstream record

431
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,640
contract. And as we're just waiting for the email stuff to get cleared up, you know, I've said

432
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,720
that a hundred times but once that's done, then anyone who has a song on the podcast music

433
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:05,400
network will be allowed to to make their MP3s available for purchase and download free and clear.

434
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,920
And by the way, we're coming up with a very interesting announcement. Another piece of the unlabel

435
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,840
is going to be snapped into place within the next couple of weeks. I'm pretty excited about it.

436
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:19,560
And you'll be hearing more about that. Of course, I'm under a strict no-damn announcement

437
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:26,040
so regulation here. But back to the ID3 tags. I think that if artists don't do that themselves,

438
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,160
then people just won't buy from them. They'll say, hey, you know, the quality of that isn't

439
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,920
what, you know, it's this we don't have a store that is offering quality because,

440
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,480
well, geez, man, then we'd have to actually put a whole bunch of people on it and be a lot of

441
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:43,960
work. And then you keep cutting into the slice of the of the artist himself. And just to remind me,

442
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:49,960
I want to talk about Ioda a little bit more as well. A report from Ola Christian Vale.

443
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,520
I hope I'm pronouncing that right. Purchasing music from PMN is working nice from the Farrow Islands.

444
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,640
I had to call to activate the account using Skype. But after five minutes, I could buy some

445
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:05,640
music from Matthew Ebel. Awesome. I cannot buy from iTunes from the Farrow Islands. And I feel that's

446
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:10,440
discriminating since we are part of the Danish kingdom. And Denmark is accepted by iTunes.

447
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,880
I've contacted the two record companies here to work on that. I will also introduce

448
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:19,240
podsake music network to them. Excellent. Dude, thank you. What about taking your daily source

449
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:25,720
code to the Farrows? Oh, oh, the Delta Sierra. I'm sorry via Scotland, then Shetland.

450
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:31,320
It's a special tricky airport with in flight 14 degrees offset. Yeah, okay, Ola. Don't think I'm

451
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:37,880
going to be doing any time soon. I'm still looking for a safety pilot, which I talked about

452
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:44,120
on yesterday's show. Got one who was sent in who couldn't make it. Another one, I'm still

453
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:51,000
hoping to hear back who actually apparently is at Farrows at Elkogolf, Tangofoxtrot. So God, that'll

454
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:58,840
be so cool. Another piece of feedback about pods at music. Hi Adam, this is Ed Ovet, host of Ed's

455
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:06,840
mixed bag. And I just wanted to say that I had spoken to Dan Johnson, who does a podcast in Ohio

456
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:12,760
called Journey Inside My Mind. And him and I were talking about Matthew Ebel on the chat line.

457
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:20,120
And Dan turned me on to the fact that Matthew had a podcast. I started listening to his podcast

458
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:27,240
in my car. And then I heard him talking about Laura Clap and playing her song, hey, hey sister.

459
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:32,840
And then I came home and downloaded the song from the podsake music network. And then a few days

460
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:40,440
later, I heard from Marcus of the podshow music rewind, who requested I send him a five-minute clip.

461
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:46,280
So I chose Laura's song. And I understand you heard her on there. Just wanted to say how it never

462
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:52,840
ceases to amaze me. How one comment to one person can start a whole string of events turning

463
00:45:52,840 --> 00:46:02,040
a relatively unknown independent artist into a fully blossomed, you know, widespread hers artist

464
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:07,800
on the podsake music network or on podcasts in general. So the podosphere is quite a community

465
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,920
quite powerful. I guess we owe it all to the power of the internet, huh? Okay, so I just wanted to

466
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:18,920
pass that little peek behind the curtain glimpse scenario type of thing to you. Take care.

467
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,320
Yeah, thank you very much. That's exactly the way it went. And I heard the song on the podshow

468
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,960
music rewind, which came from you, which came from your contacts, which came from it's just this

469
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:32,520
is exactly how it works. This is fantastic. And we've got to keep promoting it artists,

470
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:38,680
podcasters, listeners, all alike. This is how the unlabeled all fits together. Now, Mark Kelsos

471
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:42,680
says, could you have a gift option? It would be cool for a family of friends to open his email

472
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:46,440
and see that someone bought you a song. We all know people who like a certain kind of music,

473
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,440
but need to be encouraged to know more about podcasting. Maybe instead of 99 cent purchase,

474
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,800
it could be $5 option to share with ex amount of friends. Mark, yeah, that works very easily when

475
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:01,640
you have a store. Again, we don't necessarily have a store. I'm going to ask Chris Rockwell what

476
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:05,720
the possibilities are that that would only really work if it was a function of clicking by,

477
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:11,480
who's the partner we're using for the transaction piece of the unlabel. So I'll look into it.

478
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:17,560
But again, this is this is store stuff and this is not unlabel stuff. And hopefully we'll find ways

479
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:26,200
to fix that. Albert Young Niber, Albert Young Niber is actually sent in a very interesting piece of

480
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:34,680
information. And this reverts back to how do we pay artists who are outside the US? Now, you probably

481
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:39,720
know that if you have an eBay or Amazon affiliate account or even Google Adsense, you know,

482
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:44,520
every couple of months, maybe once a month in your case, a check shows up for whatever amount

483
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:49,160
you've sold and you're cut of the advertising. And it's very difficult to get these checks processed

484
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:53,880
outside of the United States, almost impossible, I'd say. And if you do find a bank that'll do it,

485
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:59,080
they charge you a huge fee, which really almost kind of takes away the whole joy of making any any

486
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:07,000
kind of money on this stuff. The online casinos use net letter says Albert Young. Maybe you should

487
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,160
look into that. I've won some money with online poker and net letters like a stop between for your

488
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:16,280
money and you would pod show and could put it in a net, in a net teller account, which is a company

489
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,520
in the UK, they take care of getting it to the person somewhere in the world. We're going to look

490
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:26,280
into that very, very good. Thank you very much, Albert Young. And now the big news, gosh, this was so

491
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:32,760
amazing. This came out yesterday sent to be my many, many people in the Netherlands who apparently

492
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:38,760
the Netherlands is listening. Raymond Port, my buddy, who's been a fan of the show for, gosh,

493
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:44,440
over a year now, almost a year and a half, probably. It turns out there's a politician in the

494
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:50,360
Netherlands, a member of the VVD party, which is a center right, not to the right, right, more right

495
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:57,160
wing. And I guess he's been reading the annual reports of the Dutch ASCAP BMI, who are known as the

496
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:04,280
Buma Stemera. And this guy is screaming bloody murder and I think he's absolutely right. He says that

497
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:11,720
it's unbelievable. Now, this is the company that takes money from restaurants, from bars, from hotels,

498
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:17,880
from elevator operators, from companies, just any, if you have a company, any company, what's

499
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,840
even if you don't have the radio on, you don't have to pay a lot, but you still have to pay money

500
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:25,080
for maybe the fact that someone's singing in your office. They take it from radio stations,

501
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:30,280
they take it from television stations, they take it from satellite broadcasters, all that money,

502
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:35,320
and it's about a hundred million a year, euros, I guess. They have an overhead of 22%

503
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:42,360
their office alone costs over a million euros a year. That's got to be some shit-nast nice place,

504
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:49,400
man. And he's saying, you know what, that's to be more transparency. I need to know what are the,

505
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:54,040
the members of the board making. That's not, you can't find that anywhere. I mean, they spend about

506
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:58,280
eight and a half million euros a year on salaries. They have a hundred and ninety people working

507
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:03,640
there. Presumably, people in the field, I guess, maybe they have a really big office, but what

508
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:08,760
the hell are they doing? Well, it turns out what they're doing is they're taking this money,

509
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:15,400
which is meant for artists. Now, I believe they're a non-profit. They should be a non-profit.

510
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:22,040
But they take this money, they collect it. And by the way, it's not like, you know,

511
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:26,680
your song gets played on the radio, you get your, your 20 cents the next day. Oh, no,

512
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:31,320
it's sometimes takes up to three years. You know why? Because they're investing that money

513
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:39,640
into stocks and bonds. They have over almost three hundred investments. And in the past year,

514
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:46,920
they lost millions of euros on their investments. This doesn't make sense to me. These guys are

515
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,800
taking the money from, that is supposed to go to artists. And of course, many artists even say,

516
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:56,040
you know, I don't think I see anywhere near my fair share of what I should be receiving. And it's

517
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:00,920
the same with Ask out BMI and the same complaint everywhere, basically. But they're investing

518
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:05,480
that money, losing the money, and then passing on whatever else they have after they've hit,

519
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:12,040
I don't think they, they deduct anything from their own salaries and check this. There's the

520
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:21,560
Repro-recht, which is a nonprofit, Vidima. I think is, yeah, it's the two combined. Vidima who does

521
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:34,200
takes royalties for copying of moving images and photocopiers. They receive 19.4 million euros,

522
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:40,920
but only distributed 6.3 million euros. What happened to the, to the other 13 million euros?

523
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:47,080
And so this guy is great. Uptrout is his name. Uptrout. Charlie Uptrout.

524
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:53,320
Alpha Papa tango, Romeo, Oscar, Oscar, tango. Dude, go get him. When I told Patricia that she freaked

525
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,760
out, man. She's like, what the hell? And you know, and she told her dad, who of course is living

526
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:02,920
off a pension partially subsidized by Buma Stemera. This is nasty. And it's been going on for a long

527
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,760
time. And I've, I've actually told Patricia about this. I said you're crazy. You know, the shit that's

528
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:12,280
going on there. It's not right. They're keeping your money for years. So, you know, that just goes

529
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:17,480
to show you how the big, the big organizations think about intellectual property, whether it's my

530
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:21,800
pictures on flicker or your song, they're stealing from you. That's just the bottom line.

531
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:26,600
To line it up today, Dermit says, I've just spent the afternoon listening to some good old

532
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,520
Elvis Costello stuff. Radio radio caught my attention. I'm sure you remember it.

533
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,440
Oh, of course, you can't play it, which is a bummer. Here's some of the lyrics.

534
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:42,840
And the radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools trying to anesthesize the way that you feel.

535
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:48,040
Radio is a sound salvation. Radio is cleaning up the nation. They say you better listen to the

536
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:53,320
voice of reason, but they don't give you any choice because they think it's treason. So you better

537
00:52:53,320 --> 00:53:00,440
do as you're told. You better listen to the radio. Elvis Costello, a visionary, a true visionary,

538
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:11,800
for sure. Well, I just got offline and I'm feeling so fine. I must have had 30 or more.

539
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:19,480
emails from friends, Lord, where will it end? So much love from these folks I adore.

540
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:27,800
Well, to be totally frank, a few were from banks, offering great mortgage deals

541
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:35,720
and three may be four of real little hardcore with a chance to enhance my appeal.

542
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:47,720
But even with a little spam, I thank God every day for this way to keep in touch with friends

543
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:57,720
with so many things to say. A little known facts about unnatural acts. So much I never

544
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:07,640
didn't know. Do they have email in heaven? If not, I don't want to go email me some love now.

545
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:29,240
Now tell me the truth, is anything so uncool? Could a person be more of a mess?

546
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:36,920
And to chatter and such and say stay in touch, but don't have an email breath.

547
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:44,680
Now God clearly meant that an email be sent any time that you have a thought.

548
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:52,360
And if you're in box ain't scoured five or six times an hour, then you ain't doing all that you ought.

549
00:54:52,360 --> 00:55:07,880
I could I ever stay in touch without my ISP. To let my friends know I'm alive and to find out who loves me.

550
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:21,080
I clung for God how to use the phone and the mail is way too slow. Do they have email in heaven?

551
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:28,760
