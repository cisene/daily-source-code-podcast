6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Throw your panties in the air.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's Friday.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We find it's always better to fire people on a Friday.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That these are statistically strong.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That there's less chance of an incident that could go into the end of the week.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So these parties are strong.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Our opening to the sets of guys.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
These aren't socks.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
These are some really good socks.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's a happy day.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But I'm on a plane.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I wish we didn't shut the door.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
They do it all by life.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
One hundred times before.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Start as if I'm telling you scum.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Why you ain't trying to get away.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We don't have our new nation.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's about to turn to respect both your reasons.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Don't worry, my cousin.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That type of sees on the door.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The car needs to look clear.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
These are my wounds now.

Whew, doesn't everything sounds better with cowbell.

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
How do you do it?

116
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's Friday.

117
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
This was different from the first week I can imagine.

118
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't know what it's.

119
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Maybe because we didn't stop since last Friday.

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I just kept on going through the weekend.

121
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And we've got the weekend right in front of us.

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I can smell it.

123
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah, that's going to be a good weekend.

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Bank holiday here in the UK.

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This is by the way coming to you from the country.

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,840
the way coming to you from the Curry Cottage. It is your daily source code. Yes, it's the

127
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,440
affluent suburb of Surrey known as Guilford. Bank holiday here means banks are closed and we get

128
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,360
Monday off. That's about all I can figure out what that means. And why do the bankers need to

129
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:29,920
day off? You know, do they really? It's probably, it's probably to delay everybody's money. That's

130
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,680
what it's for. Not a very nice day here. It's windy, which of course means the weather will be

131
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,360
changing quite a bit. Ooh, the birds are out there singing though. They're ready for spring time.

132
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,800
Lots of music in today's show. That first one, of course, was De La Vega. Christina would have been so

133
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,240
incredibly proud of me if she heard me playing that. And of course, you'd say,

134
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,400
yeah, I've known about those guys for two years. They're from Utah. You can find them on the

135
00:05:52,400 --> 00:06:00,320
podcast music network at music.podshow.com. So nothing really too spectacular happened since we spoke

136
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:07,200
yesterday. I had a pretty long session on second life yesterday, which was cool. Oh, man, I got it.

137
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,920
The listeners are starting to show up in second life. And we'll talk about that later. I think I've

138
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,280
kind of figured out how I want to use second life in conjunction with a daily source code.

139
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,920
And everything else was, it was pretty routine, you know. Yeah. I mean, well, Ron was in transit.

140
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,600
So I knew that we wouldn't be doing our typical four, four, 30 PM. My time phone calls was usually

141
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,240
last the up until dinner and then typically after dinner, there's more. And so yeah, we just

142
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,000
kind of chilled. Patricia and I watched some TV and caught up on East Enders. And of course,

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,840
watched Boston League. I love Boston League. Wow. I wish I had lawyers like that because

144
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,720
I would pay because that would that would be fun, you know, we could have we could joke around

145
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:58,080
denny crane. Okay. And lots of feedback that I had left over from yesterday. We're going to go

146
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,200
probably about actually I promised PW trying to make it what we call a 49er, which means we're getting

147
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:09,600
two slots on the satellite window today. So for those of you checking us out on serious stars one

148
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,040
or two, this show will take you up until a 7 PM Eastern time. And after that, we'll we'll be joined

149
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:21,440
by the hell way. So for once, you get to hear everything. Hello, Adam. Or should I say hello, Mr.

150
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,080
Newman. I was fortunate enough to be down at the Builder's arms on Sunday. I was just saying

151
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,880
he's referring to my second life name. You can't have your real name and second life apparently.

152
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:38,240
Make sense, kind of. So you have a given last name, which is Newman, any U.M.A.N.N. Yeah, I know.

153
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,520
Let's spend some time talking to Patricia. I've got a question for you regarding fame.

154
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,640
No, what's all? What's this with all these guys talking to Patricia, man?

155
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,960
You know, I just said to Patricia, I said, you're getting you're getting pretty famous over here.

156
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,080
You know, people are digging you more than they're digging me. You better come on the show at least twice a week.

157
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,880
Let's see. Now, I know that you've had some pretty nasty things written about you in the past.

158
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,440
I wonder whether these tend to taint subsequent conversations and interviews.

159
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,200
No, that's very interesting. Well, you know what? The lines of blurred I'd have to say right off

160
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,760
the bat, the lines between what is an interview and what is someone who is media and is

161
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,840
isn't everybody almost media these days with email and web logs and podcasts. So I've kind of

162
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,640
given up on it, you know, I just talk the way I want to talk and it's actually much easier to do

163
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,120
interviews then because I just, I'm talking to somebody and it comes out a lot better, I think.

164
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,080
Now, as you heard yesterday, Patricia always keeps some things kind of to herself.

165
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:47,040
Is there a difference when some reporter is confronting you with a story that you know to be complete

166
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:54,800
fabrication and asking you questions about it as opposed to when people have been listening to

167
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:03,600
the daily source code and are talking to you as if they know you. Good question.

168
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,560
You know, whenever I'm interviewed by someone for publication and they start saying things like,

169
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:17,040
you know, how is your flight over, you know, around the pharaohs or if they'll say, gee, you know,

170
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,200
it's Patricia having fun. You know, or some little slight reference which will be dropped in,

171
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:28,160
I'm always elated. I'm so happy because, you know, there's someone who either is A,

172
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,080
done their homework and tried to figure out what we're doing here or B, someone who's a listener

173
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,960
which sometimes is even more fun. So yeah, that makes a huge difference if they're listening.

174
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,840
And quite honestly, I can't imagine why anyone would interview me about podcasting or any other

175
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:50,960
topic for that reason without listening to the podcast and trust me on this, it happens 99% of

176
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,680
the time because they've heard this information from your show. So you're questioning about it.

177
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,800
Well, if it's fabricated, I'd just say that bullshit. That's fabricated. Now, I've never been a pilot.

178
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,440
So I can't use tailwinds, but I will use a phrase that somebody else said to me recently.

179
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Here you light up.

180
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,280
Here you, here you laid in. Thanks for coming to the draft and darts. I was a lot of fun.

181
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:21,040
Still jamming on it. Okay. I wanted to move the second life talk up a little bit today in the show in the program.

182
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,840
So let me tell you first of all about. So second life, if you're, you're listening to the show

183
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,640
for the first time, go to secondlife.com, download this thing, log in and see what it's all about because

184
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:40,240
it literally is something that messes with your mind if you're in it too long or if you just

185
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,520
all of a sudden, if you're open to it that starts messing with your mind right away.

186
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,960
So I sent off an email to the billing department saying, hey, I understand that if I've only been

187
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,280
on the system, if I've been on the system less than 45 days, there's a limit to what you can spend,

188
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,120
which equals $150 US, but I'd really like to spend some more and could you please look into that

189
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,440
form and I got a nice note back within a reasonable time frame. So they've got some good

190
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:12,480
service and good support people on the case and said, yeah, well, the problem is is that 99% of

191
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,680
all fraud internet and credit card fraud takes place in the first 45 days. I think what they're saying

192
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,960
is they want to go through one billing cycle first to make sure that, you know, I'm actually good

193
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,560
for it and that the account is settled, et cetera. They did refer me somewhere else. So I'm trying

194
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:35,680
to get the levels up and I pulled the, the who do you think I am dot com card? Oh, man, that's

195
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,800
when I got a register with GoDaddy. Who the hell do you think I am? Or don't you know who I am dot com?

196
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,040
So we'll see if that makes any difference, but it was so cool because I was walking around this

197
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,960
morning just, you know, arranging some stuff in the castle and all of a sudden I got $5,000

198
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:57,360
and linden dollars paid by Smoke Jack. And so I'm immediately I'm like, dude, you know, what's

199
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,040
this for? And thinking that, you know, I've got to take my pants off again, but no, he said,

200
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,680
no, I heard about your problems and I've been on here for about two years and here, just take this

201
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,320
cash and it'll tie you over. I'm like, well, okay, let's call this a loan then, all right, when I

202
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,000
can access funds again that I'll pay it back. I don't worry about it. So it is a loan, Smoke Jack,

203
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,840
but it was that was just so awesome to see that happen. You know, it blew my mind entirely.

204
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,920
I haven't spent any of it yet, but I've got my eye in a couple of things that I want to, I want to

205
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,320
complete inside the castle, because we are going to do a huge ass party. And this is,

206
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,280
yesterday I started to understand how I think I want to use this stuff. Yeah, it's really cool to

207
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:41,760
have podcasting and music and listening, but we were hanging out on the ground floor and I got this

208
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,320
great rug with all, you know, with throw pillows that you can hang out in front of the fireplace,

209
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,400
huge fireplace that the back wall of the ground floor of the castle. And it was me, I met this other

210
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,280
guy, Josh, who was, he's in the army. He comes fully dressed and combat fatigue, but he's got

211
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:02,000
some cool stuff. He gave me like a hundred music tracks that I can play. Not quite sure how that

212
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,040
works. Pods say for now, I mean, it's all like a metallic and some real heavy metal stuff that

213
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,520
he apparently goes and kills people while listening to. Okay, that's fine. I figured, let's have the

214
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:19,520
army guys on our side. So he was kind of a DJing away. Then there was two listeners, does

215
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,800
and Yon came in and Angie B dropped by and so we're all kind of hanging out. But when it was just

216
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,000
the guys, I handed out hash brownies who I'd gotten from someone else. And it was the funniest thing.

217
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,600
I was actually laughing out loud. It was going on as Yon and Dad's, Dad's were, you know,

218
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,440
putting eating these brownies and then had the trippy one, which actually is a vehicle that flies

219
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:48,480
you around and crashes into stuff. And I recorded a movie of it. Okay, it was so stupid. But it just

220
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,480
made me laugh. You know, it's these virtual stoneers, you know, jamming out to Metallica and

221
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,800
just walking around and into each other. It's hard to explain. It really is, but it's funny, man.

222
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:10,000
It just trips me out. So I think that what'll be cool is just a place to meet. You know, it's

223
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,760
it is literally impossible. We used to say virtually impossible, didn't we? I don't think that

224
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:22,720
applies anymore. Because it virtually is possible in virtuality. We can just hang out and, you know,

225
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,760
chill for a bit and chat. It's all about the chat at the end of the day. But part of the fun comes

226
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,160
into, you know, what new objects you have and what stuff you can share with people and new

227
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,280
dance moves you've picked up. And if you're really good and you can script in the scripting

228
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,640
language, well, then, I mean, this, of course, is who holds the true power within these virtual

229
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,840
worlds are the, the programmers, the developers, the scriptures. Those are the ones that really

230
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:54,480
do all the cool stuff. In fact, I got an email here. Was this from Gun for Higher?

231
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,680
That's a Friday since, say, oh, for sure, triple shot. Adam, about second life. If you're very bad,

232
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,560
apart from stopping you from accessing the game altogether, the developers have also created a

233
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:15,120
sort of prison known as the cornfield. Basically, you get stuck in a big field with nothing but an

234
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,080
old tractor and have to spend however much time there that the developers decide you deserve before

235
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:26,080
you return to the real world. You know what? Let's see if we can get into second life right now.

236
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,560
You obviously won't be able to see it, but maybe the sound effects will be worth this virtual tour

237
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,880
hold on. I'm just going to log in for a second. Sometimes it takes a while for it. Why is it taking

238
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,600
so long to boot up today? Because I'm asking for it. Is that why? Is this the watch pot never

239
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:50,960
boils syndrome? I see the little hand bouncing up and down in my dock. Not doing anything. Oh,

240
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,600
there we go. Probably just clearing out some caching files. Okay. Let me just connect. I'll turn

241
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:03,440
up the sound here. Oh, it connects. There we go. See if you can hear it. Oh, okay. I'm back at the

242
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:10,000
castle. What was the name of this place? The jail. Maybe we'll find it. Hold on. It's still logging in.

243
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,920
What it does now. It has to connect. Ah, there's the ambient sounds. Make sure I've got it all cranked

244
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:24,880
up here. There we go. Oh, that was real life, not second life. Okay. Let's see if we can find

245
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:35,920
jail. jail. Prison jail. Dungeon. Okay. What is that? Oh, that looks like a shopping area.

246
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:45,760
Okay. Let me just see quickly who's online. Oh, you know, who's who I met here? D. D. Trollup.

247
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:53,040
And in real life, D, I think I'm just going to, oh my second. You want to, you want to hear me fly?

248
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,000
Oh, let me, let me take you up to the roof. This is really cool. I'll take you up to the roof.

249
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:08,400
And I've got the, the Bluetooth mouth on it. Watch me teleport to my roof. Okay. I'm here.

250
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:17,440
Let's see. Oh, let me look on my, looking on my, my plant. I have a lovely marijuana plant here on the

251
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:23,440
roof whose name is Conan. Oops. There's the teleport sound. Little delayed. Oh, Conan is growing.

252
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,800
Looking good. See, the whole point is eventually should be able to smoke it. Let me see. Can I make

253
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:36,640
it rain? Water. Conan is in good health and has enough water. Oh, shoot. Otherwise, I could make a rainstorm.

254
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,600
All right. Then let me just hop into my helicopter and you'll, I'll just give you that sound effect

255
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:49,120
for a second. So I'm on the first level of the roof and now I'm jumping up to the, oops, second level.

256
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,120
There's Kaiser Winthorpe. I get these instant messages all the time. Okay. Let's hop in the chopper.

257
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:05,840
This is a Corske S76. And I have to start the engine first. Here we go. Okay. It should kick in just a second.

258
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,120
I don't know, it seems like the sound is a little delayed today. See, this is the stuff that really

259
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,080
blows the whole experience when that happens. No, it doesn't sound like it's working very well.

260
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:24,400
Ah, there we go. Okay. You're all aboard now. She's white with the, with yellow and orange trim.

261
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:34,240
Let's hover up a bit here. Let's just fly around here.

262
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,560
You don't hear much change in the pitch an hour. The sound actually I'm realizing.

263
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,000
Okay. I'm going to fly her back to the roof.

264
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,440
I can't believe I'm doing this. Like you guys really care.

265
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,200
Okay. Let me quit. I can always come back to that later. Let's get back to the show.

266
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,200
So what's really interesting is about visiting other places. Oh, so D. I was saying D. Trollip.

267
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,080
She's made me a pod show t-shirt. How cool is that? And she'll let me give them away to anybody. So

268
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,640
if you're online, look for Adam Newman, any you, a M-A-N-N, or the Curry Castle. If I'm in,

269
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,280
you know, come and drop by, hang out, bring some goodies, help me dress the place up because

270
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,520
we're going to have a killer ass, just a killer ass party. I'd say within the next couple weeks and

271
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,360
we'll be ready. And that's how I think for now, I'd like to be like to be using second life.

272
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,400
It's really just a place to meet up, to hook up with listeners of the show.

273
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,800
I guess that I didn't get to it. I wanted to talk about the Scientology Silent Birth Treatment,

274
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:47,200
the Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes used. Now, if you haven't, I really strongly suggest you read

275
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:54,480
Dianetics by Elron Hubbard because you hear so much mainly negative noise about Scientology.

276
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,280
And I know nothing about the church or the cult, but I did read Dianetics. I'm found with

277
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,080
to be highly entertaining and interesting and not that far out there, not, you know,

278
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,040
in fact, a lot of it's very, very logical. And this whole concept of keeping quiet during

279
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,800
birth and being careful with the unborn child and the same goes for being quiet during operations.

280
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,680
I buy into that, you know, your ears are open, they're not plugged up. So you got to be hearing

281
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,960
something and what kind of influence does that have on you when you're in an operative state?

282
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,240
Or if you're unborn? Ernie wrote in, says Adam, where a silent surgery makes sense,

283
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,880
Silent Birth or Zero Noise Birth is the full opposite and just a concoction of Hubbard's

284
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,680
that's not down to life at all. After the birth of my son a month ago, I and my wife had an

285
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:46,800
extended talk to our midwife and doctor about birth. This was possible as we booked those

286
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,280
two ladies privately for the whole birth. That's cool. It's like an escort service for unborn.

287
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:59,520
Kids. They dance for you, too. The two emitted hundreds of births together, but the most horrifying

288
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,840
birth they told us about was a Scientology birth. That's what they called it. Birth is all about

289
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,920
perfect breathing for the woman and breathing does make some noise. If you consider the circumstance

290
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:13,200
of the contractions, it is the design of nature. It helps easing the pain. Our midwife and

291
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,960
doctor reported that the silent birth took away longer was extremely stressful for the woman delivering

292
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,640
as she was of course fully concentrating on not to moan instead of directing the energy to the

293
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,120
right place in her body. Additional complications were coming along on top of that. Again,

294
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,520
birth is a lot about proper breathing. Sure enough, there's nothing against keeping a place quiet

295
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,240
and cozy for a birth that that part does make some sense. But hey, isn't it just all common sense?

296
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,960
Yeah, I totally agree. I don't know how strict that is, by the way, if the mother is not allowed

297
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,680
to make any noise or if the father's not allowed to make any panting noise for that reason, I mean,

298
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:54,880
Jesus, you know, it's real easy for you to start to get into the rhythm. I think I told you

299
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,240
when Christina was born, it was such a great vibe. It was in the operating room because she was

300
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,440
breech, so it was a cesarean section. And the minute she was born, when the doctor pulled this

301
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,480
alien out of my wife's belly, which is kind of what it reminded me at the time, but it was beautiful.

302
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,520
The Beatles in my life was playing, and it was, man, you just can't get it any better.

303
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,240
Twilight to hippie says, listen to the Charlie Herger comments on silent births and surgery

304
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,800
started off for some feedback. I'm a certified hypnotherapist and in hypnose school, we talk

305
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,440
some about this. In surgery, even if you're under anesthesia, your subconscious is still awake

306
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,520
and absorbing. If the surgeon says something flipping like, I'll be shocked if this bloke

307
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,920
ever heals up properly, then bam, that goes straight into the subconscious. Negative thoughts

308
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,680
affect you in negative ways. So we are taught to make recordings for our clients to listen to during

309
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,960
surgery. Interesting. These recordings have positive affirmations for the person things like you will

310
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,200
heal quickly. The surgeon performs a perfect operation. Those things will be put on the recording

311
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,880
and other affirmations that were specific to the person would be added as well. For birth, I think

312
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,880
it's similar if the delivery room is full of bad vibes that sends a negative message to the mother

313
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,520
into the baby who's connected to her with hypnosis. The pains of delivery can be less and in

314
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,960
some cases transformed into waves of sensation or relaxation. So while I don't agree with silent

315
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,200
births, it seems only natural for the mom to be to make noise. I do agree with what happens.

316
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,040
The delivery room does affect the baby subconscious. Also, what's this? I want to send you a

317
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,880
thank you today. When Sam and husband had to drive me to the eye doctor because I had a small

318
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,840
tear in my cornea. How man? How that happened? Did he slap you around? Do you just let me know?

319
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,320
I'll be okay, though. Antibiotic eye drops will clear up in a matter of days. But the thing is,

320
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,120
I have things touching my eyes phobia, which means this morning I was in full panic attack mode.

321
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,360
Yeah, I can understand that. On the way out of the door, I decided to grab my iPod. On the way

322
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,840
into town, I decided to listen to the Charlie to help calm me down. I don't know you personally

323
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,440
I don't but I've been a listener for months. Your voice is familiar and was quite comforting this

324
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,680
morning. Listening to the familiar jingles of the metro sexual moment and Trinity really helped

325
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,080
calm me down. Thank you Adam. The Charlie was perfect to push the panic down. Besides,

326
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:10,480
being a hypnotherapist, I'm also a telephone dominatrix. Oh, you be the good stuff always comes at

327
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,760
the end. So if you're interested in listening to kinky phone sex stories or liberal politics

328
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,160
and let's be honest, they go together, don't they? Or have you just curious sister? What two

329
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,320
hippies are up to in the desert? Please check out the podcast I do with my husband. No,

330
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,840
Twilight, let me just let me change that. I think you need to send me a dominatrix audio feedback.

331
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,360
Yeah, that's what I need because because I've been a very bad boy.

332
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:43,840
Good day Adam. This is Peter Bailey, a listener from Australia. Just a couple of things. I finally

333
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:51,920
got to listen to Charlie 367 this morning, which is Tuesday on my way into work. Interestingly,

334
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,240
I noticed that I was the only person on the train that was smiling. Although there was quite a

335
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,600
few other people with earphones in their ears, I wonder, does that say something about podcasting

336
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:11,440
in general or is it just me? And with reference to getting the pod show network and finally up

337
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:18,240
and running into public beta, a saying sprung to mind. It's an old project management saying.

338
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,320
It goes something along the lines of, there comes a time in every product's development where one

339
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,400
has to shoot the authors or engineers and commands production. I hope that didn't happen at

340
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,920
pod show. Keep up the good work mate. You've kept it at least this list. I'm pretty happy with what

341
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:42,560
you're doing. John, well mate, cool. I don't want to go to Australia. You know what? We're going to

342
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,720
do it. I'd say with the next two years definitely, I hope you can wait that long. Hope you still

343
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:54,320
listen to that long. So you'll buy me pints. Well, no, we don't shoot our engineers at pod show.

344
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,600
Only if they break their legs, you know, ten what else are you going to do? But we have kind of pulled

345
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,400
the trigger. We've got developers in now. As I said, we're bringing in developers first to help us out.

346
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:15,200
And create some modules and really clean the place up, I guess, to get it ready for the rest of

347
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:21,120
the world. And for those of you who have been listening to the dev cast. And of course, this is

348
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,280
for developers. So it's real geeky. And even if you're just interested in the geekiness of it,

349
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:31,680
you can consider yourself eligible to subscribe to the dev cast devcast.podshow.com. We're putting

350
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:37,120
in more golden tickets. So if you subscribe today, then you have a good chance even on the first show

351
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,880
that you'll get a golden ticket, which means you'll get credentials. You can come in. You can start

352
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:47,280
hacking away and helping us out. And we're going to do another dev cast tonight. Erano Neil

353
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:53,920
is back from her PHP or my sequel or sequel course, whatever she was doing. So I guess sometime

354
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:59,520
after dinner, I'll record that. Kevin, of course, is still back home with the family and Monday

355
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,200
he will be back. But I do want to get something going. We have a new past phrase. The whole

356
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,680
everything's all set up. We're ready to go. Andrew is a stand and buy to configure everything.

357
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:13,920
So that'll be later on tonight over at the dev cast. And some of the developers are already

358
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:21,200
checking in. Hey, Adam. Next star. Just got my ticket to the podshow plus. And I have to say,

359
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,840
I'm really digging it. It's really cool. I think there's so many features on there that no one

360
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,880
even expected. You have to say, everyone out there, when this thing comes out, it's going to be huge.

361
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,640
If you guys like, if you like my space and are going to the sick of how crappy it is,

362
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,240
this thing blows anything out there away. It's great for listening to podcasts,

363
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:49,280
great for publishing podcasts, it's great for everything. Just the podshow plus is awesome.

364
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:56,000
Keep up the great work there, podshow guys. Take care. All right. Cool, Nick. I got a look for you.

365
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,400
See if I can find you in podshow plus. And I'll dig you. We're doing some fun stuff. I'm really proud

366
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:08,720
of how it's shaping up and sorry, dropping the blackberry. And what's nice is if you're done any

367
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,400
type of development or followed along with any type of development, it's really the end where all

368
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,040
the stuff just, that's when it really accelerates and stuff gets pulled together and things start to,

369
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,080
oh, whoa, now it looks kind of like it makes sense. You know, and it's, I'm digging it for sure.

370
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,920
And the dashboard, the, the, the, the, the widget, formerly known as the player, now known as the

371
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,880
dashboard, that it is, it is changing the way you think about listening. It really is. You can build

372
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:41,280
feeds on the fly, which you listen to and you can publish and share with people. You can mix and

373
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,720
mash stuff together. You can set your own listening experience browsing through through new episodes.

374
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,400
It really, and this was all I wanted and my part of the, of the, of the spec of this because I actually

375
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:59,280
wrong drove a lot of that development. I said, I just wanted to replace iTunes. I wanted to replace

376
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:04,000
iTunes. That's all I wanted to do. And, you know, just play this stuff. Here's how I use it.

377
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,040
Please make it happen. Let it talk to iTunes when I want stuff on my iPod, but please just take

378
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:17,120
iTunes out of the equation and it's working. Hi, my name is Sam. I'm a person from Northern California

379
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,720
living in the Bay Area and I'm really happy to hear about this calm line. I think it's a, it's a great

380
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,880
idea. It's really just a well for me to get around to putting together an audio comment I would

381
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,080
never have done that otherwise, so that's a great idea. I also like the idea of making the show

382
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,760
around 40 minutes, that's about how long I commute every day and it's just right for my driving

383
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:45,120
to work. So, um, I'm great. Thank you. All right, Sam. Thank you very much. Yeah, a lot of people calling

384
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,800
in on the on the listener lines work and very well as far as I'm concerned. It's really for those

385
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:55,200
of you. I think most of you who are mobile, just if you want to, you know, record something right

386
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,640
then and there you want to provide feedback. That's what those phone numbers are really for. So,

387
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:05,280
put it in your mobile right now. Pre-program it. Just pre-program it is DSC. If you're in the

388
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:13,680
states, we've got that fine. Look at New Jersey number 20162563572016256357 or in the UK.

389
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:24,080
It's O2076813753. Give us a call, will you? It's nice if listeners call in too and

390
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:30,960
it's rather long comment, but it really summed up for me what listeners watch from a show, you know,

391
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:36,880
and that, believe me, this type of response is important. Hey Adam, this is Kelly from Aldi,

392
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,440
California. Um, just wanted to chime in now that you have the phone line which is great. I've been

393
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,400
listening to daily source codes since October when I got my first iPod and daily source codes

394
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:51,040
first show that I listened to and I haven't this one yet. Really enjoy it. And I wanted to let

395
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:56,480
you know why I like the show so much. It is the honesty. If you're talking about everything

396
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,680
is going on in your life seemingly un-sensored and just putting it out there for all of us to hear.

397
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,560
I love it when Patricia joins in the show, when Christina does, all the little segments,

398
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:11,120
Trinity, Metro fictional moments, the Rogers Small bit, those are actually my favorite.

399
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,480
I love it. This in fail, but by the way, that could not be transferred to anything else.

400
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,680
Love that. I like hearing about your mom and what's going on. It's just great. And last

401
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:26,960
Friday when you had that lamp, it was amazing. It could really tell that you were upset. Obviously,

402
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,960
I mean, you ranted for over an hour. That's a lot of outrage. And you know what's great about it?

403
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,640
If that had been me, I would never have done that. I can't imagine putting all of that motion out there

404
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,720
and sharing with the world. And you were doing that, which was amazing. And I heard another

405
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,920
rant, I think it was last week off. So this was Michael Butler on the Rock and Roll Indie Geekcast.

406
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,240
And he ranted through most of his show, we're feeding point by point just like you did,

407
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,880
criticisms of a fellow podcaster. And I remember the time wondering, you know, why are you doing this

408
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,200
much energy and time? You know, it's interesting. I heard that too. That was pretty amazing.

409
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,200
You should go back and listen to it. Not quite sure which episode it was, but Michael Butler

410
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,720
definitely went on a rampage. So when accused, yeah, it was like one of these conspiracy theory

411
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,520
posts somewhere that said, well, you know, based upon this action and him saying this,

412
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:25,520
it's clear, Michael Butler is ready to jump ship and leave touch. Hi, yeah, yeah, yeah, the conspiracy

413
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:30,240
theories, they run rampant. Training wheels people, we've still got training wheels on this internet

414
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:37,040
thing. So to the other thing, it just sort of keeps it going and I didn't get it. But what I was

415
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:44,480
hearing was un-censored, honest response, real emotion. And after the Richard Bluestein follow-up show

416
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,440
this week, which I listened to, admitting he was wrong, it all made sense in an all-came full

417
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,800
circle. And I thought, you know what, that was cool, but you just put the ramp out there.

418
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:00,400
And it did get the dialogue going about name calling it so forth. And I thought that was really

419
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,600
good. And personally, yeah, I get a fan offended by Richard or by Madge's, you see the word

420
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:11,280
kind. I feel like it's really derogatory to what he uses all around. You know, it's funny. I've heard

421
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,840
bricks use the word content. And it seems to be used in a different way. And I'm not offended

422
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,520
what it when I hear that. And it sounds more like when some people hear, use the word flag,

423
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:28,240
so anyway. But I just wanted to find a chime in and say, you have, okay, thank you very much.

424
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,920
I appreciate that. But you hit on something there that is quite interesting because you're wrong.

425
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:40,400
The use of the word content in the UK is probably the worst thing you could do. Now the word,

426
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,480
the use of the word flag on the other hand means like meatballs or some some meat dish like that.

427
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,200
So it just doesn't carry over. It doesn't carry the same weight. But, oh, man, the sea word,

428
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,640
Kant. Oh, you call someone that. And, you know, you better be bigger than another person.

429
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:03,520
It's just one of the many, many, many differences between languages and cultures

430
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,360
of the United Kingdom and the United States. And I think it's worth exploring this some more since

431
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,960
I'm in both places. If you've got any ideas about that, send it to me. We'll just call it in on the

432
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,480
listener line. You know what? I like this idea so much. We've got a song about a word from our

433
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:28,080
spine here. It's the yanks versus the brits. We'll drive each other crazy, but everybody knows

434
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:36,640
that it's apparent to see. That just like you and me, it's the yanks and the brits. The yanks

435
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:45,440
versus the brits. Mind the gap. Just myth that at once again. So let's talk about this.

436
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,320
The difference between the yanks and the brits. You know, we we breached on that. We breached.

437
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,680
We broached that yesterday. Just briefly as we talked about how easy I found it to flirt with

438
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:00,480
English women. Of course Patricia Meatley put my in place and said, no, that's all in your head.

439
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,840
There's nothing at all going on like that. Time for some more Friday festivities.

440
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,440
It's not pot safe. I don't believe, but man does it.

441
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,240
See these. I don't make it any harder. We say it and be threes about what you should

442
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,400
for free. I ain't gonna have to pay. And all your bullshit is why the fuck I say.

443
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,880
I have to give a sin and give a sin. I'll see you in the comments like a digital pin.

444
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,880
All for the DCA. Well, like pirates. We'll get our shit for free.

445
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,440
For rental advisory. You'll never fucking see. Been a couple years since I seen that FBI.

446
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,160
I want to cut it out because that shit is mad boring.

447
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,960
I'm fucking bummer than the bitch from bad boys. Except for the band and it's grandma's sex toys.

448
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,600
I'm a Disney. Feelin' on my drives. Don't wanna disobey it when the lawsuit arrives.

449
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,400
All you fucking dudes. Don't sound on the balls. Then when you get done, you run a mix and coals.

450
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,120
I better see some pages what sound to fight. You ain't gonna manage my digital rights.

451
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,320
Like criminals, pants filled up with music nerd and I'm most buying off standard left and right.

452
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,280
My full dozen count in this fucking fight. With a 56k head hundreds of songs.

453
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,160
God is my tension like asses and clocks. Now it's getting so illegal kind of tension.

454
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,800
If I get caught, I'm joined in the convict. What you heard? What's all this game?

455
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,200
It's the intro board. What I'm in a band.

456
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,280
I'm fucking bummer for the Disney. Fuck it and be double-aid.

457
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,680
Fuck it and ride double-aid.

458
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,920
Fuck the suit, find it, be assay.

459
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,200
I'm fucking bummer for the Disney.

460
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,720
Man, let me tell you. The other day.

461
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,520
All right, hey, hey. They tried to kiss me, man. Then they turned around and tried to fuck me in the ass.

462
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,600
Who's not a fuck as that sold us out? Like Judas did to Jesus.

463
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,600
For some money. Some little coins is shit. What the fuck?

464
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,600
Fuck it and be double-aid.

465
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,840
Gee, wonder what the title that song was.

466
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,680
Aha. Okay, that was definitely different.

467
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,840
Fuck the MPA and the RIA. This was sent to me via email,

468
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:14,400
came in as a bit torn hotel choral Essex. It's a whole collection, 15 songs of some internet related stuff.

469
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,320
It's more of that, actually. But it's pretty cool. I liked it very much.

470
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,520
And thought I'd share that with you for this Friday as we get ready for the weekend with a

471
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,760
little bit of Trinity.

472
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,680
Yep, it seems like we're really picking up some steam with all this biodesal stuff.

473
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,200
I got a couple of very interesting links in the first one from Bruce Moile about

474
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,800
pizza delivery cars from glass nickel pizza company. Let's see where they

475
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,520
they drive their delivery vehicles. It looks like they have a couple of golf

476
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,600
diesels, Volkswagen golfs. No, that's a polo. Is that a polo?

477
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,000
Yeah, I think it's a one of it is a golf, let me see.

478
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,840
So they've four of them. And they're using recycled vegetable oil. Very, very cool.

479
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,800
You see where these guys locate it on store locations.

480
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:26,160
This is in Wisconsin. Okay. Excellent. So if you want to support biodesal in Wisconsin,

481
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,800
there you go. Thank you very much, Bruce. Appreciate that.

482
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,600
A couple of people sent me this link about Darrell Hanna's, I guess she had a television show

483
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,240
called Love Life, DH Love Life. And it's now available as a podcast.

484
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:45,680
I'm not sure if they're doing one episode at a time. I did subscribe to it, but I haven't

485
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,360
looked at iTunes for a while, so I'm not sure how many episodes have come in, but the first one,

486
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:57,200
the first video is about biodesal. If you haven't seen it, check it out at DHLoveLife.com.

487
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,400
And I'd love to get, there's nothing on the site that explains why it's a podcast or

488
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,960
you know, what Darrell Hanna is, if she's directing involved in the podcast portion,

489
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,880
looks like a rehash of what they did on television, but still digging that.

490
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:17,520
Huh. And Alan Solomon sent me a checklist. I said, I've known about this McDonald's truck

491
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,080
that I see once a week on my morning commute for quite a while. Today, I finally got a picture for

492
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,560
you. In the process, I nearly missed my tram, so I hope you mentioned it on the show.

493
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:32,480
That's Alan from Basel in Switzerland, and he has this fantastic picture, which of course,

494
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:40,800
if you don't mind, I'll put it on my flicker page so that you don't get crushed with

495
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,960
bandwidth. I'll credit you appropriately, but it's a picture of McDonald's biodiesel power truck

496
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:54,160
fantastic. By the way, says Alan, I bought my domain name using one of Darrell's Go Daddy codes.

497
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,040
Cool. I got to tell you what the domain name was. And then finally, this is the one that got

498
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,400
a lot of press. A lot of people were talking about this. It got digs. It got mentioned on wire.

499
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:11,840
It got slash dotted. This is a tiny reactor that boosts biodiesel production.

500
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,920
And there was a cordon here that I wanted to share with you. Let me see if I can find it. Here it is.

501
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,960
Who's this guy? Mr. Janabek. I think he's from the Oregon Nano Science and Micro Technologies

502
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:30,480
says if we're successful with this, he says nobody will ever make biodiesel any other way.

503
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,600
Apparently, this reactor is the size of a credit card pumps vegetable oil and alcohol through

504
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,800
tiny parallel channels. It's smaller than a human hair to convert the oil into biodiesel almost instantly.

505
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:47,120
All right, Batman, that would be that would be outrageous. Cool. If we had to

506
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:52,160
imagine that, what a revolution that will be. Definitely, I'll put the link that article in the

507
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,880
show notes as well at credit.com and dailysourceco.com. Keep your eye on it because sometimes with

508
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,480
big discoveries like these that really disrupt industries, you never hear from the inventors again.

509
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:29,920
I've boring meeting. I've boring manager Robb. Rocks ain't code mom. He's very diligent,

510
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:37,600
but it's out for the stick. His code not function or elegant, what the code must be think.

511
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:43,680
Code mucky think. Baby manager, what a right god damn login page himself.

512
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:50,680
Food mucky not say it. I'm loud code mucky not crazy. Just proud of code mucky like

513
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:57,680
videos. Code mucky like to have a mouth too. Code mucky very simple math.

514
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:09,680
It's not too big or bloody secret art. Code mucky like you. Code mucky like you.

515
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:23,680
Code mucky like you. Code mucky like you. Code mucky like you. Code mucky like you.

516
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:29,680
Code mucky like you. Code mucky like you. Code mucky like you. Code mucky like you.

517
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:35,680
Code mucky like you. Code mucky like you. Code mucky like you. Code mucky like you.

518
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:41,680
Code mucky like you. Code mucky like you. Code mucky like you. Code mucky like you.

519
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:57,680
Code mucky like you. Code mucky like you. Code mucky like you. Code mucky like you.

520
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:11,360
Code mucky like you. Code mucky like you. Code mucky like you.

521
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,360
The lights

522
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,360
Code, but we have every reason to get out of this place

523
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,360
Code, but we just keep on working

524
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,360
Sears are pretty face

525
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,360
But try to throw a wake up either coffee cake

526
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,360
Take past it now

527
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,360
This job will fit a link and create a way

528
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,360
Such a load of crap

529
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,360
Code, monkey, thanks

530
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,360
Some day, eat out, everything

531
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,360
Even, pretty girl like you

532
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,360
Code, but we just win

533
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,360
For now, code, monkey, say some day

534
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:57,360
Don't hide our code, monkey, like we do

535
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:01,360
Code, but we like to have an opportunity

536
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,360
Code, but we have every reason to get out of this place

537
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,360
Code, but we have more money secret art

538
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,360
Code, but we like to do

539
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,360
Just screaming for cowbells

540
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,360
So make sure the guys and gals

541
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,360
A pod show are parting along with us on this Friday

542
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,360
Code, monkey, Jonathan Colton on the source code

543
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,360
Hi Adam, this is Gary from New Jersey

544
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:29,360
I thought I'd just listen listening to your latest

545
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,360
DSC and I thought I'd leave a message

546
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,360
I listened to it every day

547
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,360
It's my morning commute

548
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,360
Music, I guess

549
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,360
And I really enjoy listening to it

550
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:47,360
And it really makes the hour commute that I have

551
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,360
Go very quickly

552
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,360
I have a long commute to Princeton

553
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:55,360
And it's not an easy commute and listening to the DSC

554
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,360
Really helps

555
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:03,360
I too would like to see daily podcasts from you

556
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,360
And really think that you do a great job

557
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,360
It's a nice mixture of

558
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,360
Not just techy things, which I listen to as well

559
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:17,360
But it's a nice mix of entertainment

560
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,360
Along with technical discussions

561
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,360
Which I enjoy

562
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,360
Anyway, I thought I'd leave a message for you

563
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,360
And just say, keep up the good work

564
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,360
I really enjoy listening to your show and take care

565
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,360
All right Gary, thank you

566
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,360
That I know that commute to Princeton

567
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,360
That can be a bitch dude for sure

568
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,360
And yeah, I appreciate you making me a part of your daily routine

569
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,360
That's what that's what seems to work the best

570
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,360
Is if you kind of slip into a slot with

571
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,360
And everybody's daily routine

572
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,360
For some people on the west coast

573
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,360
I'm there 10 o'clock

574
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,360
And they actually take a break and just listen to the show

575
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,360
On the computer for others that's during your commute

576
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,360
So trying to keep it within the

577
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,360
Yeah within that 40 to 50 minute range

578
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,360
Definitely what what I'm striving for

579
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,360
That's for sure

580
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,360
And it seems to be the trick

581
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,360
You know to get people into

582
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,360
Or to get into someone's daily routine

583
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,360
And I can understand when things are

584
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,360
You know, turn out different during my daily routine

585
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,360
I get kind of bummed out too

586
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,360
I got to reconfigure myself

587
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,360
I got to do this a little bit differently

588
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,360
Oh no, he's later than normal

589
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,360
But you know he's here for a reason

590
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,360
You sound like repair man coming after you

591
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,360
You sound like repair man

592
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,360
What's he gonna do

593
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,360
He'll fit your misconceptions

594
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,360
And answer questions too

595
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,360
Turn nothing in the universe

596
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,360
And he can't move for you

597
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,360
You sound like repair man

598
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:39,360
You sound like repair man

599
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,360
Hey

600
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,360
Those of you listening to the show on Sirius stars 102

601
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,360
You know what that means

602
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,360
If not

603
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,360
It means you're about to stop listening to me

604
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,360
It's the end of the source code

605
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,360
The satellite window for for today and for this week

606
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,360
Of course we back on Monday

607
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,360
Pacific Coast Hellway is next

608
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,360
Yeast radio after that Dawn and Drew

609
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,360
And then tonight the Frank Truth with Brian Know

610
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,360
It's a podcast we can't air on podcasts

611
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,360
Because of the rights issues

612
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,360
But she got it here that it's a great show

613
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,360
That'll be at 9.930 East Coast

614
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,360
Follow by the Rock and Roll geek from 930 to 10

615
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,360
Again, have yourselves a great weekend

616
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,360
And I'll see you all on Monday

617
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,360
And for those of us still here

618
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,360
Just a couple more things I want to share with you

619
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,360
Hi Adam Curry

620
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,360
I just wanted to say that this voice feedback

621
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,360
Over a phone-in voice mailboxes

622
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,360
Or sent as email attachments

623
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,360
It's not even 1% as good

624
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,360
As real

625
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,360
Radio-phone-in

626
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,360
Because this podcasting voice feedback

627
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,360
It's not interactive

628
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,360
Once upon a time I have met in person

629
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,360
Chris Perillo

630
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,360
A guy who now lives in Seattle

631
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,360
Maybe you have had about him

632
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,360
Have you?

633
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:52,360
Well, under www.ChrisperilloShow.com

634
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,360
You can see example

635
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,360
How podcasting voice feedback should be done

636
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,360
Namely with live

637
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,360
Phone-in with full interactivity

638
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,360
And not with stupid recordings

639
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,360
What do you think about it

640
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,360
Adam and Adam see

641
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,360
Maybe you should establish

642
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,360
Once a week a live phone-in

643
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:16,360
Times when you are answering live phone calls

644
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,360
PS

645
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,360
Getting Patricia Pie on DSC

646
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,360
We'll not replay

647
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,360
We'll not replace real

648
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:28,360
Interactivity with listeners

649
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,360
Nothing will

650
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,360
So

651
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,360
Fuck you Adam Curry

652
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,360
And fuck your blackberry

653
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,360
Hahaha

654
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,360
I'm like, fuck my blackberry

655
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,360
I'll tell you what

656
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,360
Yeah, you may be right about Patricia there

657
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,360
But she's, oh man

658
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,360
The sex is much better with her

659
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,360
Than with the listeners

660
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,360
I can't be interactive with

661
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,360
And regarding the live phone-in

662
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,360
You know, I thought about that

663
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,360
And while it will work very well

664
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,360
For some people maybe but for me

665
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,360
I don't know it

666
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,360
I like talking to someone on Skype

667
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,360
Maybe once in a while

668
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,360
But I'm going to start

669
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:06,360
Exploring that with the devcast. podshow.com

670
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,360
But thank you very much for chiming in

671
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,360
And letting us know

672
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,360
Yes ladies and gentlemen

673
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,360
He is

674
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,360
Where are we?

675
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,360
He's the man

676
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,360
Saving the European Union single hand

677
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,360
Comic strip

678
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,360
Comic strip

679
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,360
Comic strip

680
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,360
Comic strip

681
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,360
Comic strip

682
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,360
Comic strip

683
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,360
Comic strip

684
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,360
Comic strip

685
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,360
Comic strip

Comic strip

687
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,360
Comic strip

688
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,360
Do you believe anything is possible?

689

We're our flank

691
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,360
We believe in an internet

692

That's safe from viruses and scammers

693
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,360
We're our flank

694
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,360
We believe your personal information

To be just that

696
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,360
Personal

697
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,360
And we believe your internet

698
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,360
Should be a friend

699
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,360
Not a fo

What's happened in friends

708
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,360
This is Marcus couch host

709
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,360
Of the scenes scene

710
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,360
And podshow music rewind

711
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,360
And hey, I've just logged into the

712
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,360
PDF and the podcast delivery network

713
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,360
And I'm starting to get acquainted

714
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,360
With the newly developed player

715
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,360
And the interface

716
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,360
And I've got to say

717
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,360
The folks over at podshow hq

718
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,360
Have really done a bang-up job

719
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,360
And this new

720
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,360
I don't like that you could call it

721
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,360
The portal of podcasting

722
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,360
And the player impresses me

723
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,360
The most. It's playing all the audio files

724
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,360
It's playing just about every movie

725
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,360
File I've been able to throw at it

726
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,360
Very, very impressive feature

727
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,360
But until that golden ticket

728
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,360
Is bestowed upon your earbuds

729
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,360
You can check out one of the feature shows

730
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,360
On PDF

731
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,360
And that would be my show The scenes scene

732
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,360
If you're into the heavy side of rock and metal

733
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:51,360
The scenes scene is the show for you

734
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,360

And in other news

737

Podshow music rewind

738
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,360

739
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,360
For those of you not familiar with rewind

It's a weekly podcast

741
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,360
It's a compilation of many music podcasts

742
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,360
And they're all blended together

743
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,360
In a multi-style mix of

744
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,360
Podsafe and independent music

745

And get your own little piece

757
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,360
Of the serious satellite window

758
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,360
I'll talk to you again next week

759
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,360
Take care everybody

760
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:53,360
Hey Adam

761
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,360
This is Barbara in Palo Alto

762
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,360
I know you're probably getting tired of hearing this

763
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,360
But you haven't inspired me to start my own podcast

764
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,360
I have an iPod consulting business here in town

765
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,360
Where, among other things

766
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:09,360
I help people learn about and listen to podcast

767
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,360
A few months ago I had the brilliant idea

768
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,360
Of creating a podcast

769
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,360
About my adopted hometown

770
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,360
Palo Alto California

771
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,360
My ideas for this to be a weekly show

772
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,360
With a mix of useful information

773
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,360
Happenings around town

774
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,360
And whenever possible, historical perspectives

775
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,360
Palo Alto

776
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,360
Then around the town

777
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,360
Palo Alto 360

778
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,360
I believe podcaching will be a great way

779
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,360
For members of the Palo Alto community

780
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,360
To share stories, reflections

781
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,360
And items of public interest with each other and beyond

782
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,360
But I need your help pod father

783
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,360
I don't want to show just to be Palo Alto according to me

784
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,360
I'd like to include different voices and perspectives

785
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,360
Preferably from people who are already familiar with podcasting

786
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,360
Or satellite radio

787
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:00,360
And what better place to do a little social networking then on the Charlie

788
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,360
So, Adam

789
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:06,360
To the Palo Alto people in your audience who would like to do some field reporting

790
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,360

797
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,360

And we met at a place in downtown Palo Alto

805
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,360
