1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Delta Sierra Charley, 34-2.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,360
Let us pray. Our pod father who art in England, Adam B. Ly name, thy pod cast will come,

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:25,040
as thy download will be done on serious, as it is on iTunes. And give us this day, our

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:32,960
daily Charlie, our metro-sexual moment, and a glimpse of our dear Trinity, and lead us not

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:40,800
into temptation, but deliver us from unsubscription. For thine is the pod cast and the pod safe

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,040
music, forever and ever, tailwinds.

7
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,040
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:37,040
I never think everything will be, I never think all I saw was me.

9
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:45,040
But while making beds a new kitchen stand, just be in the future, God rush.

10
00:01:45,040 --> 00:02:01,040
Let's see how new we'll match and let the chill easy came out of the dark.

11
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,040
Is that another look and did you mean what you meant when I thought that you meant

12
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:36,040
you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you

13
00:02:36,040 --> 00:03:06,040
You don't know what that kind of thing is you meant this means that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant about the you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant what you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you because that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant because you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant that you meant

14
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,040
Oh, the future misses me!

15
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
Thanks for the drink.

16
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,040
But my boyfriend is right over there.

17
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Imagine any man's magic went to town.

18
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,040
He's even in town with eyes.

19
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
Yeah.

20
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
I'm feeling nervous.

21
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,040
I'm in a hard drive.

22
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
I'm in a hard drive.

23
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
Cool water's ban.

24
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
Two car garage.

25
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,040
Comes to you from the pod safe music network.

26
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,040
On your Charlie.

27
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,040
A daily source code.

28
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Hey everybody.

29
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
How you doing?

30
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,040
Welcome.

31
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,040
Back here in the cottage.

32
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,040
At the wonderful podcast complex.

33
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,040
Always so happy to stand in front of this thing.

34
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,040
It is so the perfect height.

35
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
It makes such a big difference.

36
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
Well, I'm back.

37
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,040
But only for a couple hours.

38
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,040
It is Monday morning here in the United Kingdom.

39
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,040
So for the affluent suburb of Surrey in the UK.

40
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,040
I am off around.

41
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
See what my flight is around.

42
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Two o'clock this afternoon going to Amsterdam.

43
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,040
No, no flying myself.

44
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Unfortunately, seeing as the assessment of the Delta Sierra is almost done.

45
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,040
In fact, the wind commander called me up on for was it Saturday morning.

46
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,040
As I was said, before I left from San Francisco and he said, dude, I've flown it.

47
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,040
It's like a sewing machine.

48
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,040
So quiet, no vibrations.

49
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Which is apparently a big thing after you take an engine out and put it back.

50
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:39,040
And now we're just waiting for the for the new chairs which have been re-opholstered.

51
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,040
But the seats, I should say.

52
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
And then I'll be able to fly myself.

53
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,040
So I was just going to be with Stelios today with the easy jets.

54
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,040
Because tomorrow is the big lawsuit.

55
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,040
This is the one that that I've been preparing.

56
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,040
Well, I guess my lawyers have been preparing for.

57
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,040
Although most of folks who listen to the show know what I'm talking about.

58
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,040
Just a quick recap of that.

59
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,040
A few weeks ago, a gossip magazine published

60
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
Pictures.

61
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,040
A huge front front cover, which was one of their own pictures.

62
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,040
They took a Patricia as they followed her around the UK.

63
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,040
How disgusting is that.

64
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:19,040
And they got her pushing a cart of groceries, which of course always looks so lame.

65
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,040
According to at least the picture they took.

66
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,040
So life is horrible here for the for the ladies.

67
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Well, Adams often San Francisco was the whole gist of it.

68
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,040
And they followed my daughter and of course published the name of her school.

69
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,040
And how how she gets there every single day that was really nice when it comes in

70
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
Dangerment of a child.

71
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:42,040
But probably the thing that is most provable and most offensive according to the law is the the theft of

72
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,040
Pictures that I'd posted on flicker.

73
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,040
Which, of course, is all under creative commons.

74
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
You can select that.

75
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
It's self-selectable.

76
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,040
And I use the share like non commercial attribution license.

77
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,040
And they felt that just because it's said this picture is public.

78
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,040
If you look at how flicker works, it's pretty evident that public means something very different

79
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,040
than go ahead and copy this and use this for profit in your magazine.

80
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,040
And they did about three, three pages of my own pictures.

81
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,040
So we're off to go improve that the creative commons license does hold value.

82
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,040
And by the way, my life in the Netherlands with my wife and daughter is very valuable.

83
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
We've proven that in the past.

84
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,040
We've made millions of dollars on our own reality show.

85
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,040
Which, of course, we also entirely did ourselves.

86
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,040
And you just can't be doing that.

87
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,040
And this is all about the arrogance of mainstream media.

88
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,040
You know, thinking that if you publish something on your own weblog or on your side or on flicker,

89
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,040
or wherever you publish it, that it therefore automatically becomes public domain.

90
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Well, I guess we shouldn't be trying that with your shite.

91
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Now, should we?

92
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Funny enough.

93
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,040
So literally they, they entered their documents.

94
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,040
I guess, you know, their defense documents, which, of course, we get a copy of.

95
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,040
And literally what they're saying is, well, look, you know, they circle this little thing on a little copy,

96
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,040
print out of a page of flicker and says, it says this picture is public.

97
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Which means we could take it.

98
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,040
That's going to be interesting to see them prove that.

99
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,040
And then there was a whole transcript.

100
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:16,040
I mean, an entire long form written out transcript of Delta Sierra Charlie of the source code.

101
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,040
We talked about this and what my lawyers were going to do with them.

102
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,040
So they're going to enter that is saying, Curries are really not a nice guy.

103
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,040
And he doesn't deserve any retribution.

104
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,040
It's just crazy.

105
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,040
And let me, let me tell you, I really despise this shit.

106
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,040
I really do not like going to court.

107
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,040
I'm a guy who likes to settle and get things over and done with.

108
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,040
Because the only people who win at this game at the end of the day are the lawyers.

109
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,040
And I do like them very much.

110
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,040
I got nice lawyers, but, you know, they're always winning in all these things.

111
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,040
So anyway, so getting the bump in this show out as quick as I can, then hopping on the plane.

112
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,040
So don't really actually get into Amsterdam until like five or five thirty.

113
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,040
And then I'm just going to chill.

114
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:02,040
I'll be able to hook up with everyone at the office in San Francisco since we're getting so close to.

115
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:09,040
I think another hundred or a hundred people in to try and, you know, start test out the stuff that we've been working on for the past,

116
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,040
I don't know, six months, more than half a year at this point.

117
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:19,040
And then Tuesday morning, I'll get up really early before the case and I'll do the show for Tuesday.

118
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:29,040
So you won't, I'll probably post something on the weblog, depending on, well, I believe I'm getting an answer or a result or some kind of judgment on Tuesday itself.

119
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,040
So I'll post that and then, of course, Wednesday will actually have all the details in the show.

120
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,040
And along with that, we'll have Metro sexual moment because I've got just tons and tons of stuff to do in the, in the moment.

121
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:46,040
Trinity stuff as well. It's going to be a pretty busy week and they'll be nice because I'll be home for for a few days.

122
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:53,040
Something really exciting coming up on March 12th, Christina is doing her first runway appearance.

123
00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:05,040
She'll be in a fashion show with another young lady who's the daughter of, I think, a famous model who used to be a famous model.

124
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:13,040
Well, I'll get all the details from Patricia. We'll have her on later in the week and she'll, she'll talk about stuff and it's going to be fun. I'm happy to be back home.

125
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,040
It's good to be here with the girls hanging out.

126
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:23,040
Whether's not too spectacular. It's typical, you know, England weather kind of gray overcast.

127
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,040
It's chilly, definitely a lot cold in San Francisco, but the sun does peep through once in a while.

128
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,040
Regarding Podsake Music Network, music.podshow.com. That's where the cool waters band came from.

129
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,040
Later on in the show, we'll roll out a Matthew Ebal song.

130
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,040
Matthew Ebal is joined the beta test along with American Heartbreak, Michael Butler's Band.

131
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:49,040
And you can actually purchase those tracks online. Lots of feedback. Really appreciate it.

132
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,040
Again, this is not, you know, this is not like we've launched some store and come on and check it out. We're going very slowly.

133
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:02,040
Trying as best as possible to integrate the, the, how the whole experience of signing up for.

134
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:09,040
For our partner, clicking by who, you know, a lot of people have some comments. They do things in a different way.

135
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:17,040
Addresses are entered in a somewhat stranger way, but they're very open to working with us so we can really streamline this whole process.

136
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:24,040
I'll tell you, these guys, clicking by really are the best we found when it comes to the processing fee.

137
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:33,040
And also the type of data that we could pass off back and forth between them and us, which, of course, doesn't include any, any credit card information or anything like that.

138
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:40,040
But so far, we've, we've sold, I know more than 100 tracks combined of Podsake for peace.

139
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:49,040
And people, I guess, are already found Butler stuff and Matthew Ebal stuff. And so, I would think that once we get the reporting structure in place.

140
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:59,040
For every single sale for this entire beta period, which I'm just pegging it about three months, 100% of everything minus the transaction fee, which is nine cents goes to the artist.

141
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:07,040
So, you really helping out by participating in the beta test and just give us the feedback. You know, a lot of us know how we can improve it.

142
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,040
What we can do to make it better and we're on it.

143
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:18,040
Got an email from Martin Hendrix. Adam, I'm 28 year old teacher from Belgium. I do a regular podcast with the kids in my class at www.mace.

144
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,040
Mike echo, echo, Sierra dot, W.S. Whiskey, Sierra.

145
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,040
We do a weekly show in which the kids recite poems, tell jokes, read stuff from newspapers, the kids are between the ages of 10 and 12.

146
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,040
A few weeks ago, I started to, Andy, show with the Podsake tune.

147
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:39,040
And since yesterday, the kids and every other listener are able to rate a Podsake tune, but clicking on little flame icon next to the title in the show notes.

148
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:46,040
They really did this feature. And a few more weeks, I'll be putting out a top 10 of Podsake tunes on the sites as rated by the kids.

149
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:51,040
This could be really interesting getting a kids perspective on the Podsake music. I completely agree, of course.

150
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,040
And he was the interesting question. Are you planning an API on the Podsake music network?

151
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,040
This could be really useful because my kids who speak Dutch can't interact with the PMN now.

152
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,040
Is that because there's no API and what would the API be for?

153
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:10,040
Or is that a language thing? I mean, just reading your email, Martin, first of all, I think it's fantastic that you're doing this.

154
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,040
Let's get, let's educate kids very soon, very early on about music.

155
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:23,040
And that it's more than about buying a CD or downloading a track from iTunes because you've heard it on the radio and the videos have been jammed up your ass.

156
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,040
Thanks to many music channels.

157
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:32,040
Perhaps what you should do is put together a Podsake top 10 that your kids put together.

158
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,040
And maybe that you have each intro their favorite one or maybe you act as a conduit in that.

159
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,040
And let's highlight a show like that. I'd love to have.

160
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:47,040
And this is the great thing about the PMN is that we have, I don't know, we have at least four or five different top 10s.

161
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,040
That's great. It can be the top 10 of what the Dutch kids in your class think it is. There's nothing wrong with that at all.

162
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:58,040
And I tell you, you can't just take billboards list and make a top 10 because you'll get sued.

163
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:05,040
So we have our own list and the nice thing about it is there's all kinds of ways to look at what's a top 10 about.

164
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,040
So looking forward to it.

165
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,040
Big news in the UK today.

166
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,040
George Michael was a, this is so sad.

167
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,040
George Michael was apparently found in his car, slumped over his steering wheel.

168
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,040
And I guess someone who saw him around four in the morning, this was in London.

169
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,040
You know, said, oh man, this guy's probably been taken ill.

170
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,040
So called the cops and the turned out it was George.

171
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,040
And he, I guess he just kind of passed out and they found marijuana in his car.

172
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:39,040
And what they believe on this is just what the newspapers report would be ecstasy.

173
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:47,040
And I think they, they specifically said liquid ecstasy. So that would be what MDMA.

174
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
But all the newspapers this morning.

175
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,040
They're so creative and so clever.

176
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,040
So big headlines front page, the careless spliffer.

177
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,040
And then there was another newspaper had skinned me up before you go go.

178
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,040
So he got arrested and he was released and I'm sure it'll be okay.

179
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,040
But let it go.

180
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Please let the poor man go.

181
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,040
Boy, oh boy.

182
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,040
Okay. I got some promos for you.

183
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
A couple more things.

184
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,040
One chat about us as I said, some pod safe music.

185
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,040
And I'm just barreling to get out of here because there's so much.

186
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,040
I mean, my head is just boggling with all the stuff that's got to happen this week.

187
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,040
But I'm very happy you tuned in once again for the ride.

188
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,040
The disease is lethal.

189
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
It is contagious.

190
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,040
But this disease spreads by sound.

191
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,040
When you hear the voices, it's already too late.

192
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,040
You listen to birth core and you were exposed.

193
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,040
You listen to ancestor and the disease germinated.

194
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,040
It's already too late for you in five weeks.

195
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:01,040
You will be another victim of the infection.

196
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,040
Infection.

197
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,040
It's the horrifying new podcast novel by Scott Siggler,

198
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,040
All the revenge, sister and earth core.

The infection kills you slowly.

204
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,040
If the cure doesn't kill you first.

205
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,040
Hey there, this is Michael Odee from Most People Our DJs.

206
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,040
A weekly music interview is podcast.

207
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,040
When I let you know, the month of March will be a special one for Most People Our DJs.

208
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,040
As I'll be playing with permission, my music heroes like Gary Newman,

209
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
President Lloyd Cole and Stan Ridge Way.

210
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,040
And also talking about other artist writers that influenced my outlook on life.

211
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,040
So join me in reviewing the latest comics, magazines, TV and most anything else,

00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,040
Everyone's a critic and most people are DJs.

214
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,040
Especially me, Michael Odee.

215
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,040
You can find my show it www.MostPeopleourDJs.com

216
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,040
Hi Adam.

217
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:16,040
It's Derek Kay Miller from the pen machine podcast at podcast.penn machine.com again.

218
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,040
And first I have to apologize.

219
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,040
Back on DSC 339.

220
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,040
I tried to tell you how to run your show.

221
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,040
I'm sorry, man.

222
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,040
I really am.

223
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
I shouldn't have done that.

224
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,040
I mean, I'm sorry.

225
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,040
Nevermind.

226
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:35,040
On that show, you played a promo for my wife's new podcast at

227
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
lipglossanlaptops.com.

228
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,040
And she and her co-host Karyan have since recorded their first episode,

229
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
which they're putting up on March 1st Wednesday.

230
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:49,040
And in it, they asked a question that I think DSC listeners

231
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,040
might want to hear.

232
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,040
They may call these kissing potions and kissing glasses and etc.

233
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,040
And what I was doing my research for the show,

234
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,040
I actually put on one that was called Kiss Gloss.

235
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,040
And I kissed my husband to see what sort of reaction he would have.

236
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
And he thought it was horrible.

237
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,040
But I thought maybe if I was wearing a meat-flavored lip gloss,

238
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,040
you know, like bacon or sausage or beef,

239
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,040
it might be more appealing to him.

240
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Because they say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach.

241
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
So I don't know.

242
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,040
Maybe that's another marketing angle that no one thought of yet.

243
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:31,040
And well, perhaps you need to do some market research on that for our next podcast.

244
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,040
You know, like a lip gloss shaped like a fun burger or a fun hot dog.

245
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,040
And we're just stuck on some sausage.

246
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,040
Then kiss your husband.

247
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,040
He sounds so disgusting.

248
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,040
So, well, I'll have to listen to the rest of the episode to see how that went.

249
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,040
But I'm just wondering,

250
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,040
what listeners of the Charlie think of that woman,

251
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,040
man, would a meat-flavored lip gloss be appealing?

252
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,040
Because, you know, at first I thought, no.

253
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,040
And then I thought, you know, thought of myself as a man,

254
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,040
and I thought, hmm, I like bacon.

255
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:13,040
So anyway, their podcast is lipglossonlaptops.com.

256
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,040
You can listen to it March 1st,

257
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,040
maybe leave a comment there.

258
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,040
And I'll talk to you later.

259
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Lipstick and laptops.

260
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,040
Was it lipstick and laptops.com?

261
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,040
Dude, I'm totally, I'm totally, this is a,

262
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
it's really nice, actually,

263
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,040
that I'm getting so much feedback on the Metro sexual moment.

264
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,040
But you can call the Metro moment for sure, if you so, please.

265
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:44,040
And I'm getting a lot of feedback from women who realize that now,

266
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,040
we've created this little corner, little area,

267
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,040
a little virtual place where we guys hang out.

268
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,040
And we talk about all the stuff that we're embarrassed to talk about in public

269
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,040
or at the office or at school or.

270
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,040
Certainly in the locker room.

271
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,040
And I like it because I guess what women are catching onto is that,

272
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,040
you know, there is an interest as to what women want from us.

273
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,040
And there's obviously quite an interest of what women want.

274
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,040
I just said that.

275
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
Hold on a second.

276
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Let me get my careless spliffer going.

277
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,040
That should help.

278
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,040
So, I don't know about about meat flavored lipgloss.

279
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,040
Lipgloss.

280
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
I agree.

281
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,040
I too like bacon very much.

282
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,040
But I don't know if the bacon lipgloss would do it for me.

283
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,040
And by the way, this is how we work at Pod Show.

284
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,040
So, you know, you sent in this probe.

285
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,040
I actually thought the podcast was already on.

286
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,040
You sent in a promo.

287
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Or no, when you told me that this would be great to play in front of the Metro sexual moment.

288
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
I went looking for the podcast.

289
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,040
And of course, the promo was there.

290
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
That's what you sent in.

291
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,040
But immediately, I had an idea because I know that there's a sponsor.

292
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,040
A sponsor looking for that type of audience, which I think the show will have.

293
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,040
We need to get a couple shows under our belt to find out what your audience is and we need some feedback on it.

294
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
But we're in motion, dude.

295
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:10,040
And you probably will get a call from Richard over at Pod Show.

296
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,040
I told him to get in touch with you.

297
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:18,040
He was off of the podcast hotel this weekend in Seattle, which I here went really well.

298
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,040
So, we can see if we can hook that up.

299
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,040
That would be very cool.

300
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,040
One more, here we go.

301
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
Yeah, I'm Curry.

302
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,040
This is Andrew from the DJJ podcast.

303
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,040
Well, I thought I'd leave you coming, much you know, you know?

304
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
Your shows.

305
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,040
It's not half bad, not half bad whatsoever.

306
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,040
So, I subscribed.

307
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,040
You're on iTunes.

308
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,040
You get play on my iPod and cool stuff like that.

309
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:47,040
And well, I thought it was a new comment and I might be coming over to my side at

310
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,040
AJForkstiles and dot com.

311
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,040
Tell you to check it out.

312
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,040
Just tell you, you know, it's all good.

313
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
Love the show.

314
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
Keep it going.

315
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,040
It's all good.

316
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,040
All right.

317
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
Nice.

318
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Oh, he's good.

319
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,040
Here's something really interesting I learned.

320
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,040
We had a meeting last week.

321
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,040
And I was probably on Thursday since that's why I didn't do a show on Friday.

322
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,040
So, I didn't have time to tell you about it.

323
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:14,040
I've learned something very interesting about email when it comes to large services or services in general.

324
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:20,040
Something I really didn't know is that you essentially, if you want to have any type of verification service,

325
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,040
meaning you sign up for something and then an email gets shot out to you.

326
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:29,040
You click on the link or you know, or even if you just request a password or any of that stuff.

327
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:39,040
The more you send, the more likely you are to be finagled into this trap of the white lists on ISPs.

328
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,040
And I had no idea that this was, this was really such an issue,

329
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:50,040
but apparently, lots of ISPs in particular hotmail and MSN mail.

330
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:56,040
Of course, under the guise of combating spam, they blacklist a whole bunch of,

331
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:01,040
you know, and I guess it depends on the content, which would make sense.

332
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,040
You know, if you have a registration email, of course, it's pretty easy to figure out that it's a registration email.

333
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,040
So, you know, they're scanning that for spam.

334
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,040
And then they put you on a blacklist.

335
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:16,040
Currently, and I think it is with hotmail. I'm not sure about MSN.

336
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:21,040
If I send you an email to, you know, to your hotmail address, it won't arrive.

337
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,040
Because that is, if I'm sending it from adamatpodshow.com.

338
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,040
Now, we certainly have not done any email marketing whatsoever.

339
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:35,040
We've only done signups for the pod save music network of which Chris Rockwell usually has to,

340
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:41,040
manually approve what is it like 40 a day?

341
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:48,040
Because these emails go out and they bounce back because they get trapped in all these ISP email boxes.

342
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,040
Well, guess what? There's a way around it.

343
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:57,040
And there's about three or four companies with names like Suremail or Sure Delivery or whatever.

344
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:05,040
And they charge you a fee to make sure that you're on the white list of all of these ISPs.

345
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
Everyone has to do it.

346
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:12,040
Anyone who has any type of registration service that has any type of volume has to go through this.

347
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,040
And, you know, I was just blown away when I heard what the fee was.

348
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,040
Now, of course, you can do this yourself, right? You can, you can put it all together.

349
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:26,040
And, and call the ISPs yourself, but, you know, just take the service it'll cost you less.

350
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:32,040
And if you're listening to serious right now, you won't hear how much money that was because the satellite window just closed.

351
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,040
80,000 dollars. Can you believe that 80 grand?

352
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,040
80 fucking grand.

353
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:42,040
You know, to be able to just send registration emails, what?

354
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,040
I mean, I don't know if it's a setup, per se, although I must say,

355
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:55,040
a Microsoft through Hotmail and MSN only lets you use one particular provider who basically works directly with the ISPs.

356
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,040
You know, and they ensure they say, okay, this is not span, this is a registration email.

357
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,040
So these guys go on the white list.

358
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:06,040
So you have to get the 80,000 dollar service, which I'm sure is negotiable at some point.

359
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:12,040
And then you have to get an additional service just for the Microsoft, the Microsoft mail addresses.

360
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Come on, what a fucking scam.

361
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,040
This is just the beginning.

362
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Now, I had no idea this was going on.

363
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:25,040
Apparently it's really normal, and anyone who has a service with signups is aware of this.

364
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,040
But, you know, next, of course, what is coming.

365
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
I'm telling you, it's coming.

366
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:35,040
You're reading about this stuff already, probably, about SBC, which, of course, is AT&T.

367
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,040
And all the huge telco saying, you know what?

368
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:43,040
We're going to be able to really fast internet next to the internet as we know it today.

369
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:48,040
And we're going to charge companies like Google and Yahoo, and I'm Amazon and eBay and pod show.

370
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,040
I'm sure, to use the network.

371
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
Oh, my goodness.

372
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:59,040
That'll kill a whole bunch of innovation if you start changing the, excuse me, since I'm drinking one right now.

373
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,040
So good to be drinking one.

374
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:10,040
You know, if you change the level of the playing field, that's, that's, oh, it's so wrong in so many ways.

375
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,040
And, you know, and this, this is just another piece of it.

376
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,040
You know, you can, you can't start a little company by yourself, and actually be successful.

377
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:22,040
If you have email-based registration signups, because you have to wind up being 80 grand.

378
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,040
Something very, very wrong with that.

379
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:31,040
And I've had an ongoing email combat thread for over a year now with Rohir Rosert.

380
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,040
It was from, uh, pop, pop, pop off from the Netherlands.

381
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,040
And, uh, he said, Adam, congratulations.

382
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:42,040
I owe you a beer or something else that you might fancy, because he's been tracking how many hits podcast.

383
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
The word podcast has on Google.

384
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:50,040
If you remember at BloggerCon 3, which was, uh, only about not even a year and a half ago,

385
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,040
Google did not recognize the word podcast.

386
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,040
It still doesn't, and it's, uh, Gmail, spell checker.

387
00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:01,040
I just might add, um, in fact, Google at the time would say podcast,

388
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
Did you mean broadcast?

389
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,040
Which was funny.

390
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:11,040
And just recently, just, uh, just last week, we surpassed 100 million hits.

391
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,040
Let me just say that again.

392
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:17,040
100 million hits for podcasting.

393
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,040
God damn it.

394
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,040
Play.

395
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
Play.

396
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
That was nice.

397
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,040
Oh, shoot. This is, for some reason, what the hell is that?

398
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
That's weird.

399
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,040
Came up as the wrong track.

400
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,040
Oh, damn it.

401
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,040
Dammit.

402
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Dammit.

403
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Curses.

404
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
Curses.

405
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Hate it when that happens.

406
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Let's try.

407
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
So maybe this one will work.

408
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,040
Green room radio.

409
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,040
Yeah.

410
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,040
Yeah.

411
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,040
Yeah.

412
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,040
Yeah.

413
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,040
Okay.

414
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,040
This came in while I was in New York, but just wanted to play it.

415
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Because it was so nice here.

416
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,040
Check it out.

417
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,040
Hey, Adam, how are you?

418
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,040
This is Eric Bergen from the green room radio podcast that we're at greenroom radio.com.

419
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,040
We're broadcasting live from, uh,

420
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,040
20th and 7th.

421
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,040
That's right.

422
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
Chelsea Manhattan, New York City.

423
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,040
Welcome to New York.

424
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,040
Adam, a see on, uh, curry.com that you came in tonight.

425
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,040
I'm glad you made it in safe.

426
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
How about that snow?

427
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
You know, that's the worst thing about New York.

428
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:25,040
I hope you brought your, uh, your, uh, uh, boots because the day after we get snowfall,

429
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
it's the worst.

430
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,040
You can't walk anywhere in the city.

431
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,040
But you try.

432
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040
And then you fall down.

433
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,040
Hey, I just wanted to point out a funny thing that happens to me today.

434
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,040
You know, I'm an actor.

435
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,040
So I have to go around to all these places and audition.

436
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,040
So, uh, I'm walking in today.

437
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,040
I'm walking up to Times Square.

438
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,040
And, uh, I hear my name mentioned on your podcast because I was, uh,

439
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,040
finishing Friday's podcast, which I hadn't finished over the weekend.

440
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,040
So I was listening to the rest of it that I hadn't listened to yet.

441
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,040
And, uh, all of a sudden, the list of use biddies came on.

442
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,040
And they mentioned my name.

443
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,040
And they played a piece of their, uh, a podcast.

444
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,040
They did a, uh, I think two weeks ago or a week ago,

445
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,040
where they went to this Monday night hangout called Jim Crusoe's

446
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
last party.

447
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,040
And I ran into them there.

448
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,040
And I met them there.

449
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,040
And we started talking about you.

450
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,040
And they recorded it.

451
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,040
And I believe they, uh, you played a little bit of that on the last,

452
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
last Friday's show.

453
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,040
Where we talked about if we would sleep with you or not.

454
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,040
Well, I just wanted to say that the biddies in their promo only played the part

455
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
where they talk about if they would sleep with you.

456
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
They didn't talk about if I would sleep with you.

457
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,040
And I guess you'll just have to tune into, uh,

458
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,040
their podcast to see what my answer is.

459
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,040
Just saying.

460
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,040
Yeah, so that was funny that as I was, uh,

461
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,040
pulling up, uh, to 15 15 Broadway,

462
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,040
that's right.

463
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,040
The MTV building is when I realized that hey,

464
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,040
I'm listening to Adam Curry.

465
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,040
One of the people who started MTV.

466
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Well, you didn't start MTV.

467
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,040
But you had a process.

468
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,040
And you know what I mean?

469
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,040
Never mind.

470
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,040
Anyway, I just thought that was funny.

471
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,040
You know, walking into MTV and you being in,

472
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,040
and empty, the, the, the,

473
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,040
making sense.

474
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,040
No, I don't know.

475
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,040
Something.

476
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
Whatever.

477
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,040
Um, so yeah, that's it.

478
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,040
Check out www.greenwareradio.com for all your arts and entertainment.

479
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,040
Needs.

480
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,040
I'm Eric Bergen.

481
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,040
And, uh, I have some gas.

482
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
So the bathroom.

483
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
All right.

484
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Eric, thank you.

485
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,040
Complete non-secretor.

486
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,040
Very unimportant stuff.

487
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
I appreciate it.

488
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
Makes me feel real good.

489
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,040
I'll be bringing along the, uh,

490
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,040
the love microphone just to, you know,

491
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,040
for space constraints.

492
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,040
Only taken the, uh,

493
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,040
the portage laptop.

494
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,040
Still running cast blasts or running, uh,

495
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,040
beta 60 now, which, uh,

496
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,040
apparently removes the warball from some of the songs played.

497
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,040
Um,

498
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,040
and actually the interface is a little bit different too.

499
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
I'm liking it very much.

500
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,040
Um, that has a bunch of tabs.

501
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,040
And you can do all kinds of stuff that I was already thinking of asking about rewind all clear all.

502
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,040
Ah, it's just, it's really,

503
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,040
it's nice, man.

504
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,040
It's coming together very, very nicely.

505
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,040
And, uh, I actually considered a couple times,

506
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,040
now that the Mac is fixed,

507
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,040
that audio crap that, uh,

508
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,040
that they didn't tell us was broken and didn't really cop to and told us to use one application.

509
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,040
Well, they fixed it with the latest update.

510
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,040
Um, but I, I don't know.

511
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,040
I'm just so digging cast blasts are just kind of going,

512
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
it's got it all going on for me.

513
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
It's really easy to manage the show.

514
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
That's a big part of it.

515
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,040
It's not just being able to produce it.

516
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,040
Um, while you're actually doing it,

517
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,040
but to be able to manage it pre and post is,

518
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,040
is pretty damn cool.

519
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,040
Um,

520
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,040
what's that thing called, um,

521
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,040
as a Mac program that's being,

522
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,040
that someone that some German guys are working on,

523
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
Uber Castro, which looks really slick.

524
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,040
I mean, they've integrated every single bit of Mac interface that you can think of.

525
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,040
But I don't know if it's going to work at all for production,

526
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,040
because sometimes you just need a somewhat simpler,

527
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
almost dumb or way of doing things.

528
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,040
Um, and, and that simplicity is when I'm digging cast blasts right now.

529
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,040
Without a doubt, past week,

530
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,040
uh, during doing shows from San Francisco,

531
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:49,040
the absolute highlight of the week when it comes to audio feedback,

532
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,040
was the piece called, I hate Adam.

533
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,040
And just in case you didn't hear it,

534
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,040
I want to play it for you one more time because it makes me smile every time I hear it.

535
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,040
Good evening.

536
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,040
I'm Arthur Sandwich of Strange Brain Radio.

537
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,040
I'm an avid listener of Adam Curry's daily source code,

538
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,040
more recently known as The Charlie.

539
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,040
As of late Mr. Curry has become somewhat perplexed and distressed,

540
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,040
by the growing volume of his detractors,

541
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,040
and the relentless attacks upon him.

542
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
Well, Adam,

543
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,040
since you appeared to be clueless in this regard,

544
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,040
I've compiled the list,

545
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,040
of why you are so despised.

546
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:29,040
I now give you the top 10 reasons why we hate Adam Curry.

547
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,040
Number 10,

548
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,040
he used to work at MTV when MTV was still cool.

549
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,040
And as host of Headbanger's ball,

550
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,040
arguably, he had the coolest job at MTV also.

551
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,040
Number 9,

552
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,040
he is married to a beautiful former pop star,

553
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,040
who drives a lot of fun.

554
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,040
He is married to a beautiful former pop star,

555
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,040
who drives a Jaguar and has her own cosmetics company.

556
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,040
Number 8,

557
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,040
he's gorgeous.

558
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:03,040
Over six feet tall with roguish,

559
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,040
good looks and a full head of thick blonde.

560
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,040
You know,

561
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,040
fuck the list.

562
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,040
I'll tell you what I hate you, Adam Curry.

563
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,040
You're always prancing about.

564
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,040
Look at me, I'm Adam Curry.

565
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,040
I can speak five languages.

566
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,040
I fly planes and helicopters.

567
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,040
Look at me, I'm Adam Curry.

568
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,040
I've partyed at the MTV Beach House,

569
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,040
and the Playboy Mansion.

570
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,040
I'm Adam Curry.

571
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,040
I commented podcasting.

572
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,040
I was in a movie with Sean Penn,

573
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,040
and Elizabeth Herley.

574
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,040
And I was also in Truth or Dare with Mandala.

575
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,040
I had my own TV series.

576
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,040
I'm so rich and bloody fucking successful in popular.

577
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,040
I've got my own stalker.

578
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,040
And, and if that wasn't enough,

579
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,040
my last house, my last house was a fucking castle.

580
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,040
You've got some sort of magnet of vacuum

581
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,040
that sucks away all the good fortune

582
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,040
that was intended for the rest of us regular guys.

583
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,040
You're taking more than your fair share.

584
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
Well, fuck you, Adam.

585
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,040
Fuck you and the plane you flew in on.

586
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,040
Headwinds, headwinds, Adam.

587
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,040
I watched my hair back.

588
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,040
I watched my hair back.

589
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,040
You selfish bastard.

590
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,040
What?

591
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
Well, I wouldn't do this.

592
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,040
Check out Strange Brain Radio

593
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,040
if you want to hear me or more of that good stuff.

594
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,040
Oops.

595
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
Slip in my dutch in there already.

596
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,040
Thank you very much, Mr. Rusty Bender.

597
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,040
Loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it.

598
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,040
Yesterday when I came home from the airport,

599
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,040
what did I land at like 1030?

600
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,040
I was on your home around 1130, 1145.

601
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:34,040
I could have sworn I saw a mini Cooper drive.

602
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,040
But we weren't a cul-de-sac here.

603
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,040
So I could have sworn I saw a mini Cooper drive

604
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,040
the other direction.

605
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,040
And I'm not sure.

606
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,040
But you know, just referring back to that,

607
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
I've got my own stalker thing.

608
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,040
That could have been, I didn't really see the driver that well.

609
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,040
Because I only really realized it.

610
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,040
I look at the, I mean, a mini Cooper is nothing,

611
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,040
nothing special to think about or you know,

612
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,040
when you notice one.

613
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,040
But it is if it's one of the older models.

614
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,040
So you have the new ones, which are,

615
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,040
I guess, comparable to a Volkswagen Golf,

616
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,040
really just a small version of it.

617
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,040
But the old fashion mini Cooper's,

618
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,040
they do stand out these days because they are definitely

619
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,040
our, you know, it's historic.

620
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,040
You look, I said, oh, there's a goes and old mini Cooper.

621
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,040
And at the very moment, I'm like,

622
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,040
don't tell me that was Roger Smalls.

623
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,040
So I haven't heard from him.

624
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,040
And no emails have shown up with pictures.

625
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,040
So hopefully I'm wrong.

626
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,040
But Roger, just do me a favor.

627
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
We're going to have lunch.

628
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,040
I promise you, just give me a couple days

629
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,040
to get turned around, get done with my stuff.

630
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,040
And Amsterdam, you know, then we'll hook up, okay?

631
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,040
I promise you.

632
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,040
And maybe not, you know, maybe not in the next week,

633
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,040
maybe in the next couple.

634
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,040
We're going to hook up, just, you know,

635
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,040
please don't wait for me at home.

636
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,040
Sad news.

637
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,040
Last week, don knots.

638
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,040
Of course,

639
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,040
most people know him as deputy Barney Fife

640
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,040
on the Andy Griffith show.

641
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,040
I'm a, I even I'm a little bit too young

642
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,040
to really witness that, you know,

643
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,040
that show the way, you know, some do,

644
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,040
particularly because we left the United States

645
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,040
when I was seven.

646
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,040
So the reruns kind of already were,

647
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,040
I guess, taking place at that point in time

648
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,040
in the early 70s.

649
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,040
But he passed away.

650
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,040
He was 81 years old died Friday

651
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:13,040
of respiratory complications in Los Angeles.

652
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,040
And Todd Walktell was nice enough to send me

653
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,040
a little piece of audio that he picked up

654
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,040
from the Pod Safe Music Network,

655
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,040
which is titled The Ballad of Barney Fife.

656
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,040
And I figured, you know,

657
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,040
if we're going to play any,

658
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,040
play any type of homage to Don knots,

659
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,040
we might as well do it in the way that we know how.

660
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:46,040
This is the Ballad of Barney Fife.

661
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,040
Don't fret, nine girls old Barney

662
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,040
got a wife.

663
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,040
You know,

664
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,040
now this year's the Ballad of Barney Fife.

665
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,040
Don't fret, nine girls old Barney

666
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,040
got a wife.

667
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,040
But he knows how to speak.

668
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,040
One bullet's killing me.

669
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,040
If we look at it,

670
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,040
it's worth her talking.

671
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,040
And my mom picked the ball right.

672
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,040
Well, you've made your papers right hand, man.

673
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,040
And he's the bad at deputy of Babyland.

674
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,040
While you could ask any one right,

675
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,040
you're on my right, but you're in space to learn.

676
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,040
And even what you can do,

677
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,040
down to the dining.

678
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
Oh, boys, please.

679
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,040
You don't want me to.

680
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,040
The Ballad of Barney Fife is a bad afternoon.

681
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,040
You're the little bed and I'm giving them a move.

682
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,040
Ooh, the fence here's justice,

683
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,040
and she rules the setters.

684
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,040
Even if she comes in,

685
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:42,040
and Barney Fife knows you are a man too.

686
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,040
So we got comes the time act,

687
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,040
and all cities,

688
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,040
big, well-barned signs,

689
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,040
up to my sister's.

690
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,040
I ain't no ordinary,

691
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,040
he kept you there.

692
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,040
You better watch your step,

693
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,040
Mister,

694
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,040
because I'm here to uphold the law.

695
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,040
Now it's my job with the law,

696
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,040
and he's talking,

697
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,040
and I'm holding on.

698
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,040
So with the whole load,

699
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,040
this is out on a bench.

700
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,040
The movie Barney and Andrew Empress

701
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,040
spend with their women in the football club.

702
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,040
Will O'Barny, he's always swallowed the bone.

703
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,040
And I like making rules on it.

704
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,040
Barney Fife is a bad day.

705
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,040
Women who's better than I'd give him in the mood.

706
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,040
For dispensing justice,

707
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,040
he's the truth.

708
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,040
He's going to see the people in Barney Fife.

709
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,040
I'm scared.

710
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,040
It's a great time, Barney.

711
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,040
Well, Barney and Andrew did the best job around,

712
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
and I guess it was inevitable,

713
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
but eventually we're got out.

714
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,040
Folks tried to hire old Barney way

715
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,040
to another town,

716
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,040
close by.

717
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,040
I'll try.

718
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,040
What do you want?

719
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,040
The Barney stuck around,

720
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,040
because he put some roots down,

721
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,040
had his terrific man came up from Raleigh,

722
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,040
that's the capital North Carolina.

723
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,040
And he said,

724
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,040
Barney wanted to come work for me in the big city.

725
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,040
So he did it.

726
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,040
Barney Fife is one bad day.

727
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,040
He used to keep a piece,

728
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,040
but now he's moved off to Raleigh.

729
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,040
Oh, my son is poor,

730
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,040
but he brought me down to New York style.

731
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,040
He's a good man.

732
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,040

1968 when their plane was shot down while on a USO tour.

784
