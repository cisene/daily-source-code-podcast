With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

In the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We don't need no sticky and crispy.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I like to think I'm flying into this show.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Fantastic.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's Adam Curry.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Mingi moves.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's right.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm Mingi.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And I'm going to do this.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Mingi and Harvey.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And you know what?

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If anybody doesn't like the cowbell, well, they can just take it.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Say what?

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I didn't listen to my podcast.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's a gun.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, I'm the Charlie.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But after going to play the cowbell well,

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I just got to hear what you tell us.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So I'm thinking it meant keep it rocking.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm going to run.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It is the record.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It almost means laying on the radio.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's turned.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's our shot of a cliff.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
With the disposals of melody that might just catch their ears.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Well, yes.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm Mingi.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's the world.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And I'm going to run.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So I'm just thinking it meant keep it rocking.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So I'm going to run.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We're headed straight for the woods.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We've got to make no time.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We'll all be getting played at all the days.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Maybe we should go on and stretch.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We're getting used to whether or not we're crazy.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We're the next one.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000

And I'm going to run.

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So I'm going to run.

115
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And then no one will run.

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So, you have to run.

117
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,720
other ones. We're slowly going to ramp it up. And of course, this is if the artist wants it

118
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,880
obviously. So I just play whatever I want to play. We contact the artist. If he wants

119
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,720
to put it up or he or she or they want to put it up for sale, then we're going to open

120
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,920
the system up just a little bit wider. So we're starting folks. It's kind of like a staggered

121
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,240
thing, pod show plus, pod say music network. It's common. It's common. It's common. We'll

122
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:56,800
get some tissue. It's common, cranky. Kind of a funky day today. A two o'clock continental

123
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,840
time. Dutch time. My mom hears the results of a latest scan. So of course everyone's

124
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,520
nervous about that. So that's kind of funky. Also going on outside the neighbors across

125
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,120
the street. And to be fair, they did tell me about this, but I hadn't really contemplated

126
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,000
what it meant. They're putting in a new front door. So you may from time to time here various

127
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:26,720
bits of drilling, sawing, hammering. Okay. And stuff going on. And it's a hump day. You know,

128
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,120
so we're kind of writing the middle of everything. But I got to tell you, I have to have

129
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,000
catch up days or response days or whatever we want to call them because I start off one or two

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,200
threads of conversation. Nobody listens at the same time. It's all delayed. Some people are

131
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,720
more than a week. I'm not going to say behind, but that's the nature of their listening

132
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,000
habits. So they're just on a different schedule. And so comments come in also kind of staggered

133
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,440
in a way. And so what was discussed on Monday, some of it even on Friday, is really now coming

134
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,720
through on the voicemail lines and the audio feedback today. Except, of course, for this bit from

135
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,920
just the other day. Adam, it's not a report to Serbia. Just got done listening to the latest

136
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,520
daily source code. And you mentioned the toilet, the first water of your ass. And you said it

137
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,880
is mostly for women. Well, no, when I found out about this toilet, I have Crohn's disease and

138
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,920
you know, you go to the bathroom a lot. Well, when you wait too much, is this too much information

139
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,360
that you're about to give me my friend? You get sore. Do I found out about it from a lot of my friends

140
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,720
that have Crohn? They're highly recommended to toilet because like you said, you feel so fresh when

141
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,200
you're done. You know, I'll probably regret leaving this message. Yeah. But okay, you know,

142
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,040
like I said, I don't really think it was made strictly for women. I think the whole

143
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:58,160
of the day when you should be more clever when in our daily lives. Because if you think about it,

144
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,240
if you took a shower, but didn't use water and you just like toweled off, you wouldn't feel very

145
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:11,840
clean. Well, that's my two cents whatever the hell it is. I was in one. Well, we didn't say yesterday

146
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,280
is that we've actually owned two of said toilets. I forget exactly what the make in the brand was,

147
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,240
but we had them in the bunker in Amsterdam. Yeah, man, I loved them. And this actually is probably

148
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:29,520
a topic for more Metro sexual moment because you got to be clean down there, guys. Oh, god.

149
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,680
This is this show is getting off on the wrong foot already. Hey, Adam, this is Nick from Germany.

150
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,880
Not dot com just Germany. In the Metro sexual moments on Charles 383,

151
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,920
you said that you missed toilets that shoot water of your ass. And I remember that my uncle actually

152
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:53,360
has one of those. And he told me that in Germany, they're called popo duchin. Oh, Donald,

153
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,200
let me just write that down. Popo duchin. And that there is a website where you can get them.

154
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:09,040
Oh, let me guess. Popo duchin dot com of point d. It's www dot popo duchin dot d. And I don't know

155
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,760
about your German skills, but since you speak Dutch, I figured you might understand some of it.

156
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,560
If you don't, of course, that'd be happy to translate it for you. And also, since you haven't told

157
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,560
any stories about you being in Germany, at least since I've been listening to the show,

158
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,920
I hear by asking to do so, because there's gotta be something, please. Well, that's it.

159
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,720
So far, thanks for doing what you're doing. And bye bye.

160
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,440
I do thank you for the for the link. Yeah, Patricia, I definitely going to get new to it.

161
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,160
You know, if I, if I was an Amsterdam right now, and we still had the bunker,

162
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,400
I would do a sound seeing tour of this apparatus for you because it really was wonderful.

163
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,440
And the minute you even just sit down on the seat immediately,

164
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,640
nice soft suctioning action to remove any vapors and odours. And then when you're done,

165
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,960
you just hit a little button on the side there and a little thing comes out and turns

166
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:09,840
swivels up and mists, not spray, but mists, this lovely warm liquid.

167
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,040
There where you want it. When you let go of the button, that thing retracts and then

168
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:22,480
cool. That's right, the blow dryer. I miss it. Maybe Popo Dusha is something very similar.

169
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,920
Crap. For this next comment, this is actually one for Patricia. Hold on a second. Let me just

170
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,440
open up the other mic. Okay, she's next door. Getting ready. Hold on, let me see.

171
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,360
Can you come for one second? Please, come on the show.

172
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,240
All right. Yeah. Our officers are located very near the studio you see.

173
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,400
Okay. Here, the earbuds for you, baby. Okay. You want to stick those in? Because you have to hear this.

174
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,200
People talking about, um,

175
00:09:52,400 --> 00:10:01,200
says, Dr. Ready to laugh. Really? So I have two. But I think that a combination of

176
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,160
it's not working, is it? Can I help you with that?

177
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,520
These are so tiny. Yeah. You got to put it in that way first and then swivel it and then

178
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,200
jam it in and then hit you on the head there. Yeah. Let me do this one. That's what you do.

179
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,640
People hate this, by the way. They say, I don't care about your wife's ear buds.

180
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,360
Except when they drop in your cleavage. Yeah. Okay. Listen to this. Hi Adam. This is Steve. I'm a

181
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,000
listener and a pot-safe music artist. I had a couple comments. First, thank you for playing

182
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,840
Kevin Reeves. You've played it before I forget Kevin Reeves. Also for sale. I believe as of today.

183
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,280
On the pot-safe. Yeah, we're starting to sell. Every song we play on the source code will be made

184
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,360
available for, well, if the artist wants it, obviously. Yes, sure. Do you know that Kevin Reeves is

185
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,400
blind? Not that it makes any difference. But it's interesting. No, I didn't have that. No, because you see

186
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:54,160
you saw the video, right? And he had no Stevie Wonder vibe going on. No, no, no. The international

187
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,040
sign for blind pianists. Please, you got a shake to head. Yeah, no. He didn't have any Stevie Wonder moves.

188
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,880
No, no, he had no moves in fact. No moves in love. God, what a good song, huh?

189
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,920
Is that how he was a great song? So buy that for your mom, mother, the pot-safe music. Okay, so he's

190
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,760
happy we play Kevin Reeves. The songs are a couple of different times and every time I've heard

191
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,240
that I said, wow, who is this? This is fantastic. And just random is what I said to get his album.

192
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,400
Just continue to play that kind of artist who has great voice, great music, greater range

193
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,760
when it's just the whole package. Love it. I'll check out Simon James who you mentioned and I hope

194
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,000
you keep your word and play him on a future show. Another really deserving artist. Yeah, I will.

195
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,840
Now, I've got some not so great feedback that I hope won't offend you or a Patricia on your

196
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:49,600
last show, Daily Source Code 383. You'd have to purchase your baby record something for the

197
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,880
pot-safe music network and she was really against it. Now, I'm not going to pretend to know what's

198
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,440
in her mind or the reason why, but, you know, to me, it can across this really elitist.

199
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:09,360
You know, what does she meant this or not? It felt like random. I'm a professional and, you know,

200
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,280
this is for these little people that are one of these. And if they want to play with this little

201
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:20,640
hobby, that's fine. But, you know, I get paid for this. That's anything. And you'll maybe a little bit

202
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:27,360
of shame for saying, well, you know, I think it's silly for an artist who's had a career to build

203
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,960
back and try to recapture it against the youth. I think that's stupid. You know, if you've got a voice,

204
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,160
if you love music, why not? Why not go back and do it? You know, have some courage. If

205
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,240
back in the game, put some music out there, let people enjoy it. I mean, whether the couple

206
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,720
months ago you played Colin Rays, Hurricane Jane, I hadn't heard of that guy in years since

207
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,840
this song, Love Me, and I really liked at the time. And I reconnected with this artist in this

208
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,040
music, because guys still making relevant cool music that I loved. And just because radio doesn't

209
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,000
play, it doesn't mean it's not good and doesn't mean it's not professional. So I I'd love to

210
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,080
be discovering that. And I love hearing that, uh, Nancy might not have heard so while I'm seeing

211
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:14,000
what they're doing now. So, but you're, please, please reconsider. Think about recording something.

212
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,680
I mean, if you don't have fun doing it, just think about how you feel when you hear these

213
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,280
great scream and artists with wonderful songs, you know, the joy that that brings, you know,

214
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,920
bring some of that joy to someone else. Come on. It's not for yourself. Do it for this

215
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:36,800
man. All right. Again, this is Steven Stewart. It's in one. Bye. Okay. Oh, that's so nice. He's really upset.

216
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,800
Well, I thought I think he misunderstood. Yeah, I think that's not, uh, that's not what I mean

217
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,560
professional. I don't need days or anything or, you know, and looking down and other people,

218
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:58,240
not at all. Now, what I mean is my, my, um, I come from a musician family. My, my dad is a professional

219
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:06,720
musician. He always had to work really, really hard to feed us. And, uh, when I started, it was actually

220
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:15,120
normal that I had to work to, you know, once I came from schools and, you know, are you any musical?

221
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:23,040
Yeah, I have musical talent. So why not? So I started to work with my dad and we work really

222
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:30,080
hard until four or five o'clock in the morning. This is when you were 15, 15, 16 years old, yeah. And,

223
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:38,000
you know, sometimes no day off just every day. Do I get to break out the violin? No, no, no, not at all,

224
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,560
not at all. So that's how it started until somebody came in one of the jazz clubs and saw me. And

225
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,880
then I was, uh, in the meantime, I was between 17 and 18 years old and I got a contract. So from

226
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:57,040
then on a record contract, a record contract and from then on, I recorded, um, so you really had,

227
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,840
so you went straight from school into, uh, night clubs, night clubs working, working hotels. Did you

228
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:10,560
like it? Uh, yeah, I liked it because otherwise I wouldn't have done it. You know, I had to

229
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,760
choice. Do you want to do it? Okay. Well, we need a singer. Do you know all the songs? Yes, I know all

230
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:22,240
the songs. Not just singer, but you would play the clavays and the, uh, marimba. Um, the, uh,

231
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,560
yeah, seal of all native. Is that a little far? That's not a marimba. No, that's not something

232
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,720
out. That's from wood and the clavays. Yeah, this is from, uh, and cowbell, metal,

233
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:38,560
everything, and even in the, um, when we had a break, I, I was a drummer. You know, two of,

234
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,280
three of us, we were sexy. Yeah, three of us would have a break and then, you know, they

235
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:50,080
needed music in between. Um, it was a different time. So I worked really, really hard. It's got nothing

236
00:15:50,080 --> 00:16:01,680
to do with it. I know that, um, but, um, so then when I started to, um, record and had all the, I had a

237
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:10,000
lot of hits, uh, and, and did a lot of gigs. And so for 40 years, that's 40 years. 40 years,

238
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,440
I was in show business, had ups and downs and flops and hits and everything, um, good

239
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,880
many times. Great time. Great time. Did everything I want every music I tried because I'm,

240
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:31,120
I'm very multiple, uh, orgasmic. No, there's so many, so much music and, and so many things

241
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:38,400
that I like. And so I tried everything from classical to disco, from jazz to hard rock,

242
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:46,400
everything because I love it or I love music. So it's got nothing to do with that. Um, but I noticed

243
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:53,440
that life goes really, really fast. And sometimes I lay my bed and I think, oh, there's so many

244
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:00,560
things. I actually would like to try. I wish I was a designer. I wish I would, you know, all sorts of things.

245
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,440
Okay. So, you know, and, and let me just say, because the listeners don't really know this, but you

246
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:12,880
really are, you know, exploring your creativity in many different ways. Because also when I, um,

247
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,240
did my performances and when I did my gigs and, and had, and made beautiful video clips and

248
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,480
everything, I designed all my clothes myself with my sister. Yeah, you guys do in the shop now. We love

249
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:31,760
that. I, the, the most wonderful thing was being creative in the studio. That's what I like most of

250
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,680
it, which is what I offered you, by the way. Yeah. I love that. And, uh, creating the, the look,

251
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:45,120
you know, uh, your style and everything. Yes, these sort of things I love. And now, now you're working

252
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:52,560
on your offer. Yeah. And musicals and halloween. Several offers? Yeah. From, um, and actually,

253
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,800
I regretted that I never did that, but it just came a wrong time.

254
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:04,560
Yeah, I came at a wrong time every time, the last of I had was a couple of, it was actually six months ago.

255
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,280
Was it the whiz? Was it the whiz? Was it the whiz? Was it the whiz to do that?

256
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:16,160
The whiz, actually. Mr. Von der Ender asks me every time. He knows, he knows I can do it.

257
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:24,000
And I really regret that that never happened. So that's that's one thing. I regret a little bit.

258
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:31,760
For the rest, I like to do other things. Okay, so it's not it's not it's because I think that I like to know

259
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:41,200
Before my life is over. Oh, baby don't talk like that. No, it's true because I know it's goes so fast. I feel like a teenager inside

260
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:52,000
But that's of course not true. The truth is that I'm 57, you know, but in my head between my ears, I feel

261
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:59,120
30 or something, you know. And so because it goes so fast, I want to do other things. I have other

262
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,160
But it wouldn't take that much time on your life, but it's just not a creative direction. No, right now because in my

263
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:16,800
In my guts, in my body, in my the feeling that I have is I did it all. I tried it all. I've really enjoyed it. And that's it.

264
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:24,400
Regrets, just musicals. Yeah, that's the only thing that never happened. Otherwise, I've done everything.

265
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:31,440
Well, there is really good news, though, Han. Oh, yeah. There is good news about all of this. It comes to a good and sweet ending.

266
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:37,920
Adam, this is rubber head again from rubber room radio. This one comment about Lady Patricia and her

267
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:45,440
reluctance to do a pod safe tune for the pod safe music network. And you were trying to work away

268
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:52,160
around this problem by saying, hey, I'll get you some musicians and I'll get you the right lyrics and all that good stuff.

269
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,960
And we just want to hear your voice. Well, you know, in that same show, she basically already recorded a

270
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
pod safe tune. Don't you remember this?

271
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,400
Why don't you just put that on the PMN? I mean, I would download it. I'd buy that for a dollar.

272
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,080
This is great. I call it the cowbell Patricia remix.

273
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:36,800
I'm so talented. Put that on there and watch the money flow in, man. We're going to be rich,

274
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,120
right, Adam. Have a good one. Thanks. We're going to be rich. We're going to be all the by the two or three

275
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,720
pop or do her do her. Oh, you know, something, you know, what I also liked and doing that with my dad because he's a great

276
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:54,640
musician riding commercials. That's a lot of fun. Yeah, you got what? Hey, listen, we have this ad challenge coming up.

277
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,560
Yeah, for Earthlink, which means you get to create your own commercial. Can I be the judge?

278
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,520
Interesting. Interesting. You could be, you could possibly be a judge. I was thinking maybe if you'd

279
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,960
like riding commercial so much, let's write one. Let's write a good one. You could be a winner.

280
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,400
Oh, forget being a judge. Just be a winner. See that. I can't be a judge. I'm not a people.

281
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,120
It's you. I'm not like, oh, I want to do anything. I can do better. See, I'm not like that.

282
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:29,200
So there's so much talent out there. That's for sure. Yeah. That's I need it every day. I'm amazed.

283
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:36,080
Yeah, every day from here. I took this very often and fulfilled the dream right on a dream of mine.

284
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:44,640
And then I'll let you go. This is worthy from a geographical location from Kansas in the United

285
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:53,360
States of America. I was just listening to a USC number 383 and it's good now, but notice when

286
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:00,720
a Patricia's earbuds fell in between her lovely breath that you referred to those breaths as

287
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,680
guys. I find this a little disturbing. I'd like to have an explanation for you for that.

288
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,800
I've never heard this referred to as guys, quite job as it actually. Anyway, great show.

289
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:23,680
Keep it up and a good shot man. How's that? Later. Yeah, why are they gone? Well, I thought about this.

290
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,680
And I thought, why do I say that? Because when I come home from San Francisco. I'm not

291
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:34,000
being a bra right now. That would be correct. See how beautiful. Oh, oh, oh, so when I come home from

292
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,120
San Francisco is an example. I say hi baby and I say hi guys. Yeah, sure. So now I figured out where

293
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:46,560
came from. It's not that hard actually. Oh, remember Magnum PI? Yeah. Remember Higgins? Yeah.

294
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:53,360
Higgins had two dogs. Yeah. Yeah, dobermans. Yeah. And then whenever Magnum would be like,

295
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:00,640
you know, the dogs were threatening to bite him. He'd say hi guys. So I think they are new.

296
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:09,440
Your breasts are like, they can attack you. No, they do. Okay. All right, baby. Thank you.

297
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,400
But I don't want to take up any more of your time. Hey, I apologize for my parents today. Oh, I love it.

298
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,920
Really? It's the baker. The Italian baker. Would you like some pasta? Yes.

299
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:25,280
Yeah, even the beard though, because the beard is is the beard is pretty heavy. Yeah, that I don't

300
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,000
like, you don't like beard at all. It's only because it only. I don't need a facial scrub.

301
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,880
Or any other type of scrub for that. Yeah. Yeah. But is it the look you don't like as well?

302
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,640
No, it's okay. But look, it's pretty rugged. It doesn't hurt when I kiss you. Yes, it does.

303
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,800
Yeah. Okay. All right, baby. Thank you so much. All right. Everyone appreciates it. So it's not

304
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,880
It's not a lead. It doesn't mean to be. No, I know. I knew that. I just wanted you to say it.

305
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,840
Now, before I forget, I've been holding this piece of paper in my hands for weeks now. I want to thank Paul

306
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,960
Sabie, who connected me with Captain Dan, who, of course, we've talked about a great length

307
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:14,880
on the Charlie from our flight to Rotterdam. And, uh, and I keep on forgetting to to mention him.

308
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,680
And I, and I actually had this piece of paper next to me yesterday. And, and I forgot it again.

309
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:25,280
So, uh, yeah, Paul, I owe you more than two beers by now. Mate. Okay. Paul Sabie, everybody. Thank you

310
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:30,240
very much, dude. Really appreciate it. And if I have a window CE gig for you, of course, I'll put

311
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,840
you at the front of the line. You're crazy. All right, Pacific Coast. Hellway is next for those

312
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:40,240
you listening to us on, uh, serious stars 102 followed by East Radio Don and Drew, the Gilmore daily.

313
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,880
And then, uh, the Frank Truth. I, uh, I was wrong yesterday. That's today is the Frank Truth.

314
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:52,000
I'll see you tomorrow. And meanwhile, here on the Charlie, we're moving forward. Why is the world so

315
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,120
corrupted? Why is it so terribly negative? And all we can hear about every day is bombs and weapons

316
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,800
and the failing economy and greed and money? Well, who the hell cares? Me and my two

317
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,600
compatriots of granted a show that lets you get away from the typical bellycraft that goes on.

318
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,120
And yes, I know all kinds of crap goes on. And it's a show for the people that like to get away from

319
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:19,120
it all and hear great skits, rants, raves and all kinds of really cool stuff. Um, and actually we have a

320
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,160
new advice column where you can actually submit your own questions to and now we'll currently run

321
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:29,200
a contest where you can win your own skit on the show. It's going to last five or ten episodes. So

322
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:36,480
that's pretty sick. All you have to do is go to www.thepodcast and idiots.com and click on the

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,840
sidebar and you can subscribe in many many many different podcasts and clients very easily.

324
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:50,880
So all you need to do is go check out three idiots and a podcast at www.thepodcast and idiots.com.

325
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,440
Once again, that's www.thepodcastingidids.com.

326
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,120
Three idiots podcast is proud to be produced and recorded on a map.

327
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:07,760
Probably no less. So we tried out some hypnosis stuff yesterday. Jeffrey Schaefer sent in a

328
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,920
Gmail out and listening to the May 9th show and laughing my ass off. You in Patricia just too funny.

329
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,480
I listened to you show a lot last year around episode 300 got too busy to continue. But here I am

330
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,880
again listening to show while I'm my one and a half hour train ride one friggin way.

331
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,520
Keep up the great stuff. If you're ever headed to Japan, especially in soccer, let me know. I'll show

332
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:33,040
your on dude. I would love to come to the the Eurasian basin. Gotta go to Australia. Gotta go to

333
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:39,760
Japan. I'd like to go to China in person. Okay, PS those hypnotic tones fuck me up for like two

334
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,240
minutes, man. I was writing an email totally focused and then heard those tones and it was like

335
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:52,640
you erased my mind. Scary stuff. PPS just reread my email before sending an out damn. I sound like

336
00:26:52,720 --> 00:27:00,080
a loser. Sorry. That's okay. We accept losers here. Elaine says those tones set off a migraine.

337
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:06,000
I get nasty migraines and have for 20 years when a migraine is building around 10 hours prior to a

338
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,120
full blown migraine for me. I become very sensitive to bass sounds and ammonia like odors.

339
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,880
I get a metallic taste to my mouth and very photosensitive. So I'm rather sensory triggered.

340
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,760
The last tone you played actually pierced my head like an ice pick right above my right eye.

341
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,800
I could put a fingertip right on the location. I wasn't even using headphones just my computer

342
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,960
speakers. Man, I don't know what it does to other people but I sure won't download the program.

343
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,600
Actually, I thought it might be great when you mentioned it. Wow, thanks for the warning, dude.

344
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,800
Well, I did warn you and it didn't work as far as I'm concerned. I'd say that's two strikes against

345
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:48,960
the whole idea. I apologize. I really do. But luckily there is some solace.

346
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:57,600
Darepool, Patrick Darepool writes in another way. Here we go. Wait, that's not the right one, am I?

347
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,520
I'm sorry. He wrote a whole thing about about the US Iran Iraq oil thing. But he actually sent me this

348
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:14,720
link to a site called warpmymind.com and they have MP3s for download. Now I registered

349
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,200
but that doesn't actually let you download any of the cool stuff. These are MP3s that apparently

350
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:28,640
give you sexy dreams and all kinds of other stuff. I'll get those up for tomorrow.

351
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,400
I have to get my credit card and everything all arranged. But I just want to get started with the show.

352
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:40,480
We'll try, I'm not going to try those piercing tones anymore. I don't, and if we do anything with any type

353
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,560
of mind control stuff, I will definitely warn you beforehand. But I do want to try out the sex

354
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,120
dream stuff. So I'll look for that. Maybe Friday will be a good day to try out the sex dream sounds.

355
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,240
What else are we talking about yesterday? This is all just responses. It's amazing.

356
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:04,960
Amazing. Oh, about sweating, night sweats. Hi. P-dub. My darling P-dub sent me a, sent me an email.

357
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,880
I presume it's okay for me to read it. But he says that he's a huge night sweater.

358
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,560
Ross, cause it covers everything I contact because it's soaked in the morning. Oh, man. Oh,

359
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:20,240
P-dub. That's disgusting. On the other hand, I think I need to sweat at night. I always feel

360
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,320
great in the morning after a good sweat. Yeah, you know, I have to agree. Now last night,

361
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,840
no sweating. Here's what we did. Well, actually, I saw this email come in from George B. The third

362
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,920
George Burnett. Adam used to have the same issue when two things were in effect. One,

363
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,880
two, a high of a thread count of your sheets, 300 plus Dernia, I guess it is,

364
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,560
makes the sheets very hard to breathe yet. We've actually, that is one of the things we discovered on

365
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,280
our own and two sleeping naked. If I slept naked, I would get the sweats every night. Put on a

366
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:53,280
shirt and or boxers and you'll sleep like a baby. And you know, and I have I've slept naked all my life.

367
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,720
I think I had pajamas and I was like up until like six or seven. But then once I discovered

368
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,800
what was going on down there, I didn't want anything in the way. And I've slept naked ever since

369
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:09,840
and last night, slept with shirt and boxers and absolutely phenomenal, no problem at all.

370
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:16,080
So thank you very much. Thanks for sharing both of you. Voice mail feedback numbers,

371
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:27,440
201 in New Jersey, 625, 6357 in London, 02076813753. Hi, Adam. This is Janice from Minnesota. And

372
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,240
I'm going to try to keep this brief, but I have three comments. The first is about audio feedback.

373
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,400
The phone is a great idea. I've been wanting to leave you an audio audio comment for a long time.

374
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:45,840
But I have to say that I've been hoping that when you unleash Pacho Plus, it includes an easy way for

375
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:54,880
ordinary listeners who don't have Pacho's podcast to leave audio comments record them and leave it

376
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:01,840
and send them to their favorite podcasts. I think pre-recorded comments have the potential to have

377
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:07,280
higher quality, not just audio quality, but also kind of slot quality and content quality.

378
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,440
Hmm, I hold on a second. I got to interrupt there for a second. So first of all,

379
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,560
yeah, we're looking at several different ways to provide simple feedback from your computer.

380
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:21,600
If there's some Java applets, there's Macromedia flash stuff. There's a couple of ways to do it.

381
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,560
And we're probably going to partner with one of multiple parties to do that. So absolutely,

382
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:32,000
a cast blaster, we could also do a miniaturized version of the cast blaster engine could certainly

383
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,400
handle it. So that's another option, although that would only work on Windows and not on a Mac.

384
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,480
But I disagree with what you say about audio comments that are done in high quality, that the

385
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:49,200
content is also better. I totally totally, totally disagree and besides that, even lots of people

386
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,720
drive around without the recording stuff. If you're listening to my show on the go and you want to

387
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,760
just respond right then and there, well, it's fresh. I think the phone line option really is the best.

388
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,800
I'm hoping that. Oops. And I just have to mention, if you call the phone lines,

389
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,600
I still haven't figured out how to put in the personal reading. So you get the very

390
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,120
impersonal, leave your message now, send a fax, whatever, press 5 to page. Just leave the message.

391
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:19,600
You call the right number. That will be in Pledgeau Plus. My second comment is just a suggestion.

392
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,320
Just like you play promos, it might be interesting to have a feature in the daily source code

393
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,760
where listeners suggest they have a podcast. I have a couple of suggestions in that and within

394
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,280
that, first of all, I was listening to daily source code for several months before I discovered

395
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:40,320
digital flotsome and people may not realize that the satellite repairman who was voiced

396
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,760
they hear when they first listened to DSC has a fantastic podcast of his own. So I would suggest

397
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:51,120
digital flotsome for your listeners and another, you know, I hold on a second. Good idea.

398
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,400
Absolutely a great idea. If there's a podcast that you want to promote, I'll accept that.

399
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:02,480
Please, I was talking to Brittany the other day. You know, my second life partner?

400
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:09,520
That sounds so fucked up. And she said, you know, I really love the promos.

401
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:14,720
It's interesting. So you know, the problem is, is someone who promos sucks so bad or they're

402
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,440
so long and not entertaining and just, you know, just doesn't grab your imagination at all.

403
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,640
So, you know, listeners, get creative. Please, I'll accept it through the phone line too.

404
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,800
Doesn't matter. Just, you know, it doesn't have to be a big montage. Just really mean it.

405
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,680
Sell it. Sell it to me, please. I listened to every week. Of course, daily source code is number one.

406
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,480
But another podcast I listened to, inside the net, in last week's interview,

407
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,240
they suggested that a future episode and I don't know if it's the one that's posted today

408
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,040
or not would include an interview with the creative second life. So I thought you might know about

409
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,360
like to know about that. Anyway, my final comment is just about the length of the podcast.

410
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,480
I know a lot of listeners have said 40 minutes and I have to say that I think one of the

411
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,680
beauties of podcasting is that you can vary the length of your podcast and I'm happy to see that

412
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:07,120
you've been doing that anyway. So anyway, keep up the great work at them. I really love the daily

413
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,000
source code. I enjoy my commute because I have something great to listen to every day. So thanks again,

414
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,040
take care. No, you take care and thank you so much for calling out in. And I'll check that out.

415
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,920
I'm familiar with the podcast, but what was that? Those guys. I'm familiar with that. I'll

416
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,280
definitely check out that episode you mentioned with the creators of Second Life.

417
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:35,440
Spent a little time to yesterday. You know, I'm just about ready to start pulling it all together.

418
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,920
I was thinking maybe we do, and now this is just, you know, what can I say?

419
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:48,720
Yeah, maybe I shouldn't. Maybe let me pull it all together. Friday we'll talk about the big

420
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,040
bash that we're going to do Friday. But there is some other SNL stuff to talk about today.

421
00:34:53,040 --> 00:35:08,400
Hello. Hey, Roger. Now I'm at the go for home in Second Life. Yeah, yeah, it's pretty cool.

422
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,160
Hey, where are you been? It's been three weeks since we heard from you. Yeah, yeah,

423
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:22,480
since sale. Yeah. Hey, Roger, myself. I got to go. Yeah, so I changed my

424
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:30,480
hometown. Yeah, I thought you were buying. Hey, CSB. Yeah, and we move the bedtime story

425
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,240
towers so you can see curry castle. And now we have a matching son in a house. Yeah, it's pretty cool.

426
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,520
ACSB, don't forget to stop by the bedtime stories. My kids will go from home in Second Life.

427
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,440
Yeah, you can't miss us. We're right there by where you live. Right by the tower.

428
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:52,560
Remember CSB, once you do go for, you never go for anything else. Sorry about that. Just

429
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,040
little go for human. Hey, like I'm trying to phone. Check out this cool matchup. I got from the

430
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:16,400
pod safe visit network.

431
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:46,360
Okay, by the way, uh, there's not a day goes by

432
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:51,080
that I don't get 20 emails at least of people looking for the castle.

433
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:56,080
So, for some reason I got delisted off of find, I'll put it back in again, you should be

434
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,080
able to find it.

435
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:02,120
I'm going to move the whole place today onto right in the middle of four plots, which

436
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,920
I've been able, thank you very much, Gabrielle, real for letting me buy your land.

437
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:12,720
So now I have enough to really, because you have all these limitations of how many

438
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,800
prims, what they call them, you can, you know, put on to a piece of land.

439
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,960
So if I'm covering four, then all four corners will count in a different land, then I

440
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,320
think you can actually combine all the land together.

441
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,960
So, uh, all I want is just to have more, more place to put stuff down, you know, so

442
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
we can have more fun.

443
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,960
What's up, baby?

444
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,960
I was listening.

445
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,760
And I thought, uh, I think you need to explain every time and over and over that you

446
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,240
are not talking about real life.

447
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,240
I said second life.

448
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,080
Oh, yeah, but do people know, maybe new listeners?

449
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,080
Hey.

450
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,400
Excuse me, this entertainment expert, okay, the hell is that?

451
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,840
Well, because you're talking about plots and buying plots and I think buying plots.

452
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:56,680
People who listen to the show either understand, you want to produce the fucking show?

453
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,680
No.

454
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,320
Okay, well, I appreciate it, but it's, that was, that would be like me coming in and saying,

455
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,040
I think you should do that and see instead of D, this is my art.

456
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,040
I don't care.

457
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,040
I don't care.

458
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,040
I don't care.

459
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,040
I just, I was curious.

460
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,040
Now I understand what you're saying, but I can't reintroduce every single time.

461
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:18,360
I'm not a topic that we discuss, but no, no, no, come back here, please.

462
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,080
And front of the microphone where people can hear you.

463
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,080
Yes.

464
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,000
I understand what you're saying, but first of all, people aren't stupid, don't underestimate

465
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
my listeners.

466
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,040
The figure, the, the, the, the, the whole thing, the, the whole thing, it's, not only

467
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:34,680
a second life, but when we talk about things, I don't go back and explain everything

468
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,680
all the time.

469
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,160
I mean, some things weren't re-explanation, but this has been on the cover of business

470
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,160
week.

471
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,160
People have heard about second life.

472
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,360
It's not, they're going to look for it.

473
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,360
That's how it works.

474
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,360
All right.

475
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,360
Okay.

476
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,360
Okay.

477
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,960
If you ever wanted to disturb the man behind the curtain again.

478
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,760
Oh, you called me, too, in the middle of something, doesn't matter, does it?

479
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,800
No, no, but I'm, I'm, that's why we're married for 20 years this year.

480
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,320
Part of, but part of it is, if I go back into explaining what it is, I'm not explaining

481
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,080
what, saying real fast, oh, I'm going to talk about second life, what they call them virtual

482
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,080
worlds, I guess.

483
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,080
But there you go.

484
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
That's what I mean.

485
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,080
All right.

486
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,080
Yeah?

487
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,080
No?

488
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,080
Okay.

489
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,080
Okay.

490
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,080
Bye-bye.

491
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,080
This is worse than the guy that Howard Stern had to deal with, who had to go WNBC.

492
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,080
I guess you stopped listening to me.

493
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,080
Diet, I don't know what I was saying.

494
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,080
Oh, I see how it is.

495
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,080
I go away for a week.

496
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,080
I'm locked out of Curry Castle.

497
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:41,080
This is Angie, just in case you forgot and see if you can any blow jobs from this avatar.

498
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:48,480
Angie, Angie, this is all a virtual world stuff we're talking about, of course.

499
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,400
Now, actually, I tried to find you because I'd love to have you be one of our first showcases

500
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,400
in the palace.

501
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,720
And I think I've got all the technology bits figured out, of course, what we need is a live,

502
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,400
I will not say a live live performance, but a live recording of a live performance or something

503
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
like that.

504
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,400
And I'm just messing around with all kinds of permissions and learning myself.

505
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,920
And you have only been in this virtual world for two weeks.

506
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,320
Don't get up, it's tough with me now.

507
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,320
Please.

508
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,320
Please.

509
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,320
Hi, Adam.

510
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,000
This is Franco from Rock-Cast detail.

511
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,600
I'm talking on behalf of all detailian podcasting community.

512
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
We really need pot show plus.

513
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:32,840
We are very annoyed by the lack of visibility that use music store deserves for independent

514
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,840
podcasts.

515
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:40,280
Here, in Italy, we have many, many very good podcasts, but none of them on the first page

516
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,000
of the eight-use music store.

517
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:50,320
And top 10 top 100 standings on it use are occupied only by foreign podcasts, especially

518
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,400
mainstream media, retransmitted as a podcast.

519
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,640
They are pod squatters, they are only two of the five-space squatters.

520
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:03,760
They are just to take visibility away from independent people doing good stuff.

521
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,600
But we want to succeed or to fail only based on our skills.

522
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,440
And we don't need this kind of bottlenecks.

523
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,400
We really hope pod show plus will give us some solution to this problem.

524
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:24,080
And we hope that there will be ways to select podcasts based on language and not only

525
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,840
by topic as the ITU's music stories.

526
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,240
Oh, one more thing.

527
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,840
If you're looking for some good foreign podcasting tunes before you go there, all right,

528
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,840
dude, here's what I want to do.

529
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:42,520
Because obviously the problem is we're all American ignorant Americans and ignorant

530
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,520
Brits for that matter.

531
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:49,680
But certainly when it comes to iTunes, we're just not good at thinking about global view,

532
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,680
I guess.

533
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:56,640
And that's for another yanks and a Brits some other time, but I'll make this deal with you.

534
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,800
If you put together a segment, make it, I don't know, five minutes or so.

535
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:09,000
And in English, introduce the different bits of your three favorite Italian podcasts.

536
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,480
And then actually put in a little piece of those, which of course will be an Italian,

537
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,040
it doesn't matter, you know, we'll get the idea, if you set it up properly, I'll put it

538
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,920
right in the pod finder, man, we'll put that on the homepage of iTunes, okay?

539
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,760
So that's the deal I make with you, my friend, my me go, whatever you say in Italy.

540
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,160
We have a lot of very good pod safe bands here in Italy.

541
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:34,480
One of my favorites is a skin that's Sierra Kilo in the November Gulf, and one of

542
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,160
their songs that's non-chapuniente is on the pod safe music network.

543
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,880
It would be a very good tune to play the cowbell on.

544
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,960
Okay Adam, that's all for now.

545
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,120
This is Franco or Castitalia Seninoff.

546
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,760
Franco, Franco, Rocastitalia, great man.

547
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:55,440
Well, of course I went to the pod safe music network, and I can just hear Chris Rockwell

548
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,880
cursing at me now because I already made the promise everything that goes up on the show

549
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,120
is made available for sale.

550
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,680
Like, I'm hoping we can do international artists by now as well, so dude, I'm taking

551
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,680
your advice.

552
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,680
Let's play it.

553
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,080
Next to me is Pasi Raston.

554
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:55,080
We have a lot of very good pod safe music network, and I can just hear Chris Rockwell

555
00:43:55,080 --> 00:44:01,080
and I can just hear Chris Rockwell and I can just hear Chris Rockwell and I can just hear Chris

556

570
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,260
to definitely cut me a five minute piece

571
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,540
and we'll put it in a pod finer, be a lot of fun.

572
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:02,980
And you got to give me the artwork

573
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,100
and the links and all that crap too

574
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,140
because it's in a hands-pod cast for iTunes only.

575
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:07,780
So we'll fight fire with fire, okay?

576
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,340
Don't tell them, and though.

577
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,580
All right, everybody, interesting Wednesday.

578
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,420
Good start today.

579
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:15,500
I'm early, so I can get all the other stuff done.

580
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,820
I want to get done today before San Francisco wakes up.
