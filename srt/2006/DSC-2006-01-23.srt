1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 321.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Fantastic! It's Adam Curry!

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hey everybody! It's the start of a new week coming to you once again

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
from the Curry Cottage. We're back home!

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's Monday!

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I love you!

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Kiss me now!

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I like stuff.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I see you on the street looking over at me.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I can't smell that desire. So I'm in over my feet.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I try and shake it down, but it's easy to shake.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How I feel every time.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I think I'm losing my mind this time.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It happens to me.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm falling deep for food.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,600
But I'm still, but still, if I know my name

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,600
We are holding every people in this ordinary world

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:20,600
I am holding every boy extra holding every girl

22
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:30,600
This is gonna be nice to remember the day

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,600
When you came home and you took me away

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,600
Didn't you let you know that I still do this way

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Every day, every time I still lose in my mind this time

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,600
That hasn't to me, but I was falling into the edge of you

27
00:01:50,600 --> 00:02:01,600
But still, if I know my name we are holding every people in this ordinary world

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,600
I am holding every boy extra holding every girl

29
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:14,600
This is gonna be nice to remember the day

30
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,600
When you came home and you took me away

31
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Didn't you let you know that I still do this way

32
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Every day, every time I still lose in my mind this time

33
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,600
That hasn't to me, but still, if I know my name we are holding every people in this ordinary world

34
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:42,600
This is gonna be nice to remember the day

35
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,600
When you came home and you took me away

36
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Didn't you let you know that I still do this way

37
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Every day, every time I still lose in my mind this time

38
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,600
That hasn't to me, but still, if I know my name we are holding every people in this ordinary world

39
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:12,600
I am holding every boy extra holding every girl

40
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:19,600
This is gonna be nice to remember the day

41
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,600
When you came home and you took me away

42
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Jack in the pulpit

43
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Extraordinary girl from the pod save music network

44
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

45
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Yeah, okay, I've reintegrated everything into the podcast complex beer

46
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Here back at home, still rocking on cast blaster

47
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,600
And happy to have the Dishiba Portage, now a fixed piece of the equipment

48
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
I can just use my power book for all the other stuff I use it for

49
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Because we can't have more than one audio application open at a time

50
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
More on that later in today's show

51
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Lots to talk about some sad news to start off with

52
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Which happened for a Friday after I'd already put the show up

53
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
I got a call from Patricia

54
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,600
I think I mentioned this a couple times that our dog was not doing too well

55
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
She was old Jesse

56
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,600
We had saved as with most of our, I think all of our animals

57
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,600
We rescued her from the dog pound in Jersey actually

58
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
And she moved with us from Jersey to the Netherlands

59
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
From the Netherlands to Belgium, from Belgium here

60
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,600
With, of course, all the issues of getting her in the country

61
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
And she had really just gotten old and was deteriorating

62
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
So we knew the end was coming

63
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
But she just couldn't hang on much longer

64
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Patricia had to put her to sleep on Friday

65
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
It was a major bummer

66
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,600
One, of course, just because it's like a child

67
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
It's a big dog

68
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
We've never had to put one of our animals down

69
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
It was really big we've always had cats and smaller dogs

70
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,600
All of our pets are our children

71
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
But this wouldn't even more so I guess

72
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,600
And it was really sad that Patricia had

73
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Of course, I was asleep

74
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Hold a different time zone and everything

75
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
So she had to take care of that

76
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
By herself

77
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Which really suck because of course I wanted to be here to support her

78
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,600
And I couldn't be and of course I couldn't say goodbye to my dog

79
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
So that was sad

80
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,600
But it was very courageous of Patricia to make the decision

81
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
And to do it, not wait any longer

82
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,600
And I think that actually

83
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Jesse already appeared in one of Patricia's dreams

84
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
And that's, it's funny that way

85
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Because I knew it would happen

86
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Usually within three to five days after someone

87
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Or something is passed on

88
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
They appeared Patricia's dreams

89
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
That's when she finally gets the rest and feels okay

90
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Everything's okay

91
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
And the dog is now in a good place

92
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,600
But it was, especially after being away for two weeks

93
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
And it was almost home on my way home

94
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,600
And so that just, that really sucked

95
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Anyway

96
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
So it's a lot quieter on the house

97
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
There was no Jesse to come

98
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
I mean, oh man, it's quite a great dog

99
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
This was the dog that

100
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,600
When we lived in Belgium and I had the helipad out back

101
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Whenever I came, whenever she heard a helicopter

102
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
She was like fucking radar from Mash

103
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,600
She comes, here comes daddy, here comes the helicopter

104
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
And then as I would be landing down on the pad

105
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
She would run right up on the pad

106
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,600
And stand in between the skids and bark at the cockpit

107
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
And be like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

108
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Welcome, how are you doing?

109
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
And then she'd wait until we were down

110
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
She'd never get under the skids

111
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
The first couple times she did that

112
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Everyone was a bit freaked out

113
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
But we got really used to it

114
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
She just run up and start barking at the

115
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
This is a huge helicopter

116
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,600
And then once we were down and opened the door

117
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Then she'd jump up and she said hi

118
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
She had a great life, she really did

119
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
So I feel good about that part

120
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Okay, so what should we start with today?

121
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
I've done a little line-up of stuff

122
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Let me see, let's talk about the pod safe music network for a little bit

123
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
Because a lot of people

124
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
You know, now that we're getting, actually I was going to

125
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Hopefully we were going to start testing on Friday

126
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
And it's going to happen sometime this week

127
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
We wanted to have a few things

128
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Just change for the flow of everything

129
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
To make it a little bit better

130
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Remember, this is all beta test

131
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
And I'll talk about this some more

132
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
As we get through some of these comments

133
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
You have to understand that we're not like

134
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
This is not like we're opening an iTunes music store

135
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Anything, okay?

136
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
This is just us guys trying to make something happen

137
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
Trying to make something work

138
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,600
And just like the pod safe music itself

139
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,600
We'll release early and we'll release off

140
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,600
And we'll make stuff better

141
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
And we want to hear your comments and your feedback

142
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,600
And we're really just working very hard on it

143
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Let's get to some of the comments about the pod safe music network

144
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Okay, Adam, this is town camp from St. Louis, Missouri

145
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
I just wanted to release some audio feedback

146
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,600
You know, I'm extremely excited about being able to purchase MP3s

147
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
And the free and clear

148
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
I got my first MP3 player in 1999

149
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
So I've waited a long time for this opportunity

150
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,600
I just had a couple comments on one of the briefs for you

151
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
First, I really like the locker idea

152
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,600
Where music that I purchased will be available for me to download again

153
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,600
If my hard drive were to crash or something like that

154
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Also, you mentioned some stuff about social networking

155
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,600
I think it's a great idea. We really need to bring this in there

156
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Rating songs

157
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Seeing how many people purchase songs

158
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,600
Sharing playlists

159
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Sending people recommendations

160
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Maybe even purchasing songs for somebody else

161
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
So I could pay for it

162
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,600
And it would show up for my girlfriend's account when she goes to law again

163
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Another thing

164
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
It'd be great if we get songs that are included in a loss list

165
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Audio format

166
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Like flack

167
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Then if MP3 ever goes away

168
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
We'll be able to convert our songs into whatever the good code I get

169
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Finally, and I'm sure you thought about this before

170
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
But I just wanted to say it anyway

171
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,600
The artist in me would really like it if

172
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Artists could pick the prices for their songs

173
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Give pot show a fee off the top or a percentage

174
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Kind of like eBay does

175
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
And then they could set it however they want

176
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
I think that would be great for

177
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Artists being able to set marketing strategies

178
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
And doing supply and demand for themselves

179
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Anyway, I'm super excited for going out and purchasing MP3s

180
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
From Pod Show

181
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Until the download their up so

182
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Till then take care bye bye

183
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Yo, okay, so a lot of things set in there

184
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
The first thing I'd like to address is

185
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,600
You know the songs that are in and because we're not a store

186
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,600
And don't charge a fee or make you go through aggregators like a CD baby or whatever

187
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
To get your stuff up there

188
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
It is going to be up to the artists themselves

189
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
As to what quality they put up and make for sale

190
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
As we go along, I'm sure that they'll be requests

191
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
To change stuff

192
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Actually, I've seen some people who wanted to change their

193
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
They're MP3 files or put up a higher quality

194
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
And weren't able to, that's a comment

195
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
That obviously has been passed on to the dev team

196
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
The development team

197
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
And then this whole thing about pricing

198
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
This is very interesting, you know

199
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Everyone's focused on pricing pricing

200
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
And I'm focused on how do we

201
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Get people interested how do we get podcasters

202
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
And listeners more involved

203
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
And how do we get actually before we can even talk

204
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
About pricing how about we make this work

205
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
So people buy some stuff

206
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Timothy Pilgrim says you set up the newest form

207
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Of media for audio, you set up the pod save using that

208
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Working, you still abide by the antiquated

209
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
99 cent model of business

210
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Come on, you've got the opportunity to do something right here

211
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
You're on the ball, obviously

212
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
So why latch on this archaic system that our economies

213
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
seem to be hung up on why 99 cents?

214
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Why not make it an even buck?

215
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
Okay

216
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Let me just go through the comments

217
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
And then I'll actually address the pricing issue

218
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Specifically

219
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Um

220
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Let me see, do we have another one here

221
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
Hi, Adam Steve from Feed of Clay here

222
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Just a quick note to say one of the best benefits

223
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
For artists selling their their tunes through the

224
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Pod save music network is the fact that unlike CD Baby

225
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Or items music store and artists can upload single songs

226
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
For sale and not have a whole album finish

227
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Yeah, I like that as well

228
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
You kind of played she said on

229
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Show number 197 which is from an album in progress

230
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
And it's great because now we can start selling

231
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Singles and get the music out there faster

232
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
The new album is going slow because I have two young girls

233
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
And I take a lot of free time

234
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Dude, you know priorities first right

235
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Prayers for your mom. Thank you mom's doing better

236
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
By the way, you know she's still in the hospital

237
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,600
And there's no date when they're going to let her out

238
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,600
But she is doing better she's uh she's gaining some strength

239
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
And Steve continues by saying

240
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
I can't say tailwinds because I'm not a pilot

241
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
But thank you very much

242
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Yeah, you know I

243
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
I saw Robin from Inside Works who's also a pilot

244
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
For a major major

245
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Airline and he agreed

246
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
You know if you're going to say tailwinds

247
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
You can only do it if you're an airman or an airwoman for that matter

248
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
Uh one other thing

249
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Uh that was a good comment from Peter Yarros

250
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Adam's so glad to hear that purchasing on PMN is coming along

251
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Well, I worry about one thing though

252
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
ID3 tags when I get music off the PMN

253
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
I've noticed the tagging is incredibly inconsistent

254
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
I'm willing to put up with that as a podcast

255
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Are getting a free track to spin

256
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
But as a paying customer I think I'd be quite frustrated

257
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,600
I hope that there will be some sort of ID3 quality control for paid tracks

258
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Uh well

259
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
There you go

260
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
I think that that is definitely going to be

261
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Up to the artists themselves to make sure that that is

262
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
You know that that's taking care of

263
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Otherwise

264
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
You know the cost of we already have

265
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
You know obviously silver cost and bandwidth cost etc

266
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Which is over-seable

267
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
And we have

268
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Chris Bershier's full time on the podcast

269
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Music Network

270
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Michael Butler part time part of his time is spent on it

271
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,600
You know those are real cost and then

272
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
You know the only way I can see that happening

273
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Is if we then become kind of a buffer zone

274
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Where we ensure the integrity

275
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
And the quality and all that

276
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
And I just think that

277
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
That's going to take a too much towards a

278
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
A stringent store format

279
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
You know and it'll also really slow down

280
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
House you know this is the whole problem

281
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
With the iTunes music store is getting stuff up there

282
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
It takes a minimum of six weeks

283
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Unless you go with you know people in between

284
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
And all this quality control

285
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
I think we have to learn how to do this ourselves

286
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
I really do

287
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
By the way Peter continues

288
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
I'm not a real pilot myself my father was one for many years

289
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
He commuted to work by airplane before he threw his back out

290
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
I flown a plane before one sort of

291
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
When my earliest memories of

292
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Is of sitting in his co-pilot seat

293
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
Reaching my little feet out as far as I could

294
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
To hold onto the yoke

295
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
I was wearing blue socks

296
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
And I remember being jealous that my dad had more controls on his side

297
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Good time

298
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
So if I may add him tailwinds

299
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
All right. We'll let you go. We'll let you slide on that one man

300
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
So about this pricing

301
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Um

302
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
I don't like the variable pricing idea

303
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
I you know I can't really put my finger on it

304
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,600
But I think that when iTunes music store and the

305
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
U.S. opens up to variable pricing

306
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Which is going to happen it's already happened

307
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
And in other music

308
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
iTunes music stores and other regions

309
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
That what'll happen is when something gets popular

310
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
And the price goes up

311
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
That's exactly you know and the music industry

312
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
Is said this you know hey popular songs

313
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Should be charged more

314
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Um what I'd like to do

315
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Is

316
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
You know as we get into this beta

317
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
As we just you know start and work it out

318
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
I think what we should do is we should start

319
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Just at 99 cents why 99 cents and keep it fixed at 99 cents why

320
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Well

321
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Yes

322
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
What?

323
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
You're dropping by

324
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
Your microphone is attached to the karaoke

325
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
So you have to go get your microphone

326
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
If you get your mic then you can drop by

327
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
We get you know the the AKG mic

328
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
No that's cool that's fun

329
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Come on

330
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Which is dropping by everybody

331
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Cool

332
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
Okay

333
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
So back to the 99 cents

334
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
Um

335
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
My feeling is and

336
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
And we can change this at any moment

337
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
That's a good thing you know nothing's going to be set in stone

338
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
But I think let's just start with

339
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Um with 99 cents fixed pricing

340
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,600
99 cents of course because it is become more or less an industry standard

341
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Why go cheaper because cheap and first of all for the customer

342
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
Who's buying songs?

343
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
I don't think there's a huge difference between you

344
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,600
Do you really go out and search for the 89 cents song or the 70 cents song

345
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
And you'd be more apt to buy that

346
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
I think that doesn't make that much difference

347
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
You know when you're talking the difference of 10 or 15 cents to the

348
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
To the to the customer I don't think it matters

349
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
From a marketing perspective

350
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
It feels very much to me like if we do that

351
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,600
If you go cheaper then you just cheap in yourself

352
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
You know just hey

353
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,600
Therefore it may not be as good this is what a lot of people think as well

354
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
And why should independent music be worth less

355
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
And why should it be worth more you know

356
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
It's let's just keep it on par and we can always go back and

357
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,600
Turn to variable pricing if that's what we feel the market needs to bear now another thing

358
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
That just amazes me

359
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600

The weather yeah, yeah, but that's because you know you're puked

385
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,040
You have children you can't even second time in 20 years

00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,120
It's dribbled

388
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,560
Sort of gagging yeah, okay, so yeah, that's when you have kids and they have things home

389
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,320
Yeah, Christina's home from school today

390
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,280
And it was exactly the time that our beloved dog I just told everybody what about

391
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,440
Yeah, so I was already upset my stomach was already upset

392
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,120
I told everybody how how brave you were to do to take care of all that stuff

393
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:53,280
It's just I have nightmares from it. Yeah, nightmares because you know I always send you or leave you with the dogs at the end

394
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:59,360
I know and I walk away. Yeah, I have to do all that yeah, but this is I'm Dr. Dad deciding to

395
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,040
Let a dog die, you know, deciding like this is the time you have to die now

396
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,520
It's horrible. That's why I can't understand where people kill other people

397
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:19,200
Or you know, yeah, but if you're but animals, but if you're if you were terminally ill and you're in pain and and you just want to go

398
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:25,360
That's something else, yeah, but you know just do you do want me to take care of you then don't you?

399
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,640
Yeah, okay

400
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,240
No, what were shooting healthy people and and of course now

401
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,880
No, I cannot imagine I was thinking about that because I had to do that and and what and of course in England

402
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
You know, they they

403
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
What is your talk of it?

404
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,240
Hunting they do a lot of hunting. Yeah, and I don't understand that either the hunting. No, I cannot

405
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,600
Just now I know guys who go hunting and we'll shoot at ducks in the sky

406
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,800
But can't shoot at a duck if it's just sitting somewhere looking at another

407
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:05,160
They've been staring to you. Yeah, but if I'm flying over those shoot him. Yeah, yeah, so it makes it make it make me think a lot about these things

408
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:13,480
Yeah, yeah, and because I felt that way and I noticed also because I was alone this weekend and you know as a mom

409
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,760
You think about a lot of things you're more worried because you can't share it of course

410
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:22,280
But you husband because he's not there and you have a teenage you're going in and out and I don't know do things

411
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,160
You feel very lonely. I know I felt a little bit. It's scary. It's so scary because

412
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,440
You hear a lot of things on the radio like children disappearing and

413
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,520
Yeah, and

414
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,360
Or you know they get killed or girls that are just disappearing or they find them killed

415
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:46,200
I and I felt by myself is the world getting worse? Is it me? No, the world's not getting worse

416
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,320
You're just hearing more of it. That's all or that's what I'm saying

417
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,840
We just know too much. That's all. No, you don't know too much. It's just we more signals coming in

418
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,960
Are the people getting worse? I'm not mean

419
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,440
We're finding out how bad people really are it's like this whole

420
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,640
What's Jack Abramoff in

421
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,440
You know the the lobbyist

422
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,600
Yeah, he's been giving money to to all these senators and congressmen. It's you know

423
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,320
We just we learn of we're not getting worse now

424
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,440
Meiner people have always fucked each other up

425
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,320
Is that so yeah, yeah, sure. I mean, there's just it's still so disappointing

426
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,320
Yeah, yeah, I don't yeah

427
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
Absolutely

428
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,400
And I'm you know, I'm old enough

429
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,880
Yeah, you know, I should be

430
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,680
No, I think I have to get used to this by now, but but

431
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,320
No, you know, I'm not you can't get used to

432
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,320
I can't get used to

433
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,760
Now see so these were my little I missed you very very much

434
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,040
Yeah, I missed you too. I'm happy you're home. Yep. Gonna be home for a couple weeks and then I'm gonna go to New York for a week

435
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,400
I know

436
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,240
And are you gonna come to San Francisco?

437
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,320
Everybody wants to see you. Yeah, you got to come hang out dude. Yeah, yeah, yeah, otherwise I'm gonna get some boyfriends

438
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,320
You know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and

439
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,920
And the weather's a little bit better than two days of rain while I was there two weeks too

440
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,320
But it's always it's refreshing actually. Yeah, now it was it was refreshing

441
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,120
Okay anything especially you want to talk about you just drop in just to say yeah

442
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,120
These were my the thoughts so

443
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,080
Now I'm well, we might as well just they're gone. We might as well just say right now that you know

444
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,200
So I guess we're filing the suit with these uh with the the magazines. Oh, yeah, yeah, that too. Yeah, so

445
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,760
I guess I can say from the court from experience

446
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:38,600
Yeah, that that's getting getting a little bit more meaner than it was in my days

447
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,760
You know, I say 20 years ago or you know, and you know, and then yeah, but though but

448
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:52,040
Yeah, but the line has been pushed. Yeah, yeah absolutely. Yeah, the line absolutely. They say that here over here too

449
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,040
the

450
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,320
Celebrities yeah, yeah, it's a bit meaner

451
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,880
Being a celebrity big brother is on here's been on for two weeks and it's going for another week

452
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,960
I guess and Dennis Rodman is in in the big brother house. Yeah, he's cool

453
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,960
Makes me look pretty cool. Yeah, he's very laid back. Yeah, he is a little bit impolite

454
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,880
Uh-huh

455
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,480
That's a pity because I always defend the Americans because say, you know, they are really nice

456
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,280
Yeah, they are really sensitive and

457
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:27,800
That's just the way they are and and and they've been brought up like this

458
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,560
And they're different and we are in Europe speak for yourself

459
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,040
That's how we are yeah, I'm saying you guys you we are you Europeans you're you're yeah

460
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,640
You're okay, I'm married to an American, so but I'm kind of European. I'm not so I always defend you guys

461
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,480
always because I've been there. I've lived there the wonderful people

462
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:54,760
Always helpful and always always humorous. Yeah, when they're said that really said more said than we are

463
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,000
And when they're happy them

464
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:05,400
Very happier than we are. It's different. It's more emotional. Yeah, and I could see that the difference in the in a big brother house the

465
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,480
Americans Tracy

466
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,120
The one from they watch and then it's rotten excuse me

467
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:19,160
When I burp what do you think of when I burp what do you think of? I don't even hear it

468
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,080
It's supposed to say San Seo. Oh, he's that's out. Oh, God. Thanks for listening

469
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,080
You don't know this now

470
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,520
So yeah, that's when I was there

471
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:43,480
That was I was I was telling about that that that he was very miss on the street, but he is impolite and and and it doesn't say please

472
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:49,720
And thank you. Yeah, I'm ashamed about that because it's true, but he's very very smart and he knows

473
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,080
Very well, it's going on and he is very nice and he is like trying to help everybody out

474
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,520
Yeah, he just does not say please and I just a big you know

475
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,160
Oh

476
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,480
What a what a body on that guy, though

477
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,480
I'm calling crap

478
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:14,280
Yeah, he was wearing a leotard yesterday. Did you see that? Yeah, he had something the basket was big my

479
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,600
Goodness hold on one second. I just have to let everyone know who's listening to this on serious

480
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:24,120
sidelight stars 103 that our sidelight window is closing Pacific Coast. Hellway coming up next followed by

481
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,760
Magic and Dawn and Drew and if you want to hear the rest of this conversation you have to download the podcast

482
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:37,240
That's the end of that. That means the sidelight window is closed. Okay. You like that?

483
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,240
Close

484
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,520
Alrighty

485
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,520
So that's it for now

486
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,480
Okay, there was

487
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,200
Let me see I was just going to do yeah, now I was just going to go a whole bunch of podcast and stuff so you may not care

488
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,680
Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah, kind of well like the BBC

489
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,240
You know the BBC released their numbers. Well, you want to hear for one second just listen BBC about podcasting

490
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,240
All right, it's really but it's really interesting just listen to the first minute of this and I'll tell you what's

491
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,520
About seven podcasting has it seems suddenly taken off

492
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,920
The chat first of all podcasting a suddenly taken off suddenly

493
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,600
I thought it was for a long but listen this is really interesting. This is from the BBC from radio for you

494
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,400
And familiar with it means letting listeners download a radio program or other audio material

495
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,640
Entrepreneurs or personal audio player such as an MP3 or an iPod

496
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:36,680
Because that this morning show that the today 10 past eight interview was downloaded over 400,000 times last month

497
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,840
Secondly among BBC programs to radio ones Chris Moiles show

498
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,320
But podcasting could change the face of radio you don't need a license to do it

499
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,320
So it's open to other media groups to challenge the established broadcasters

500
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
Okay, so now this is where it gets interesting

501
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,960
Because what is about to say he's about to mention all these podcasts that are really successful

502
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,880
But none of them are from the BBC. I'm really corresponding to our Douglas reports

503
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,600
First it was Ricky Javez on the Guardian Unlimited website

504
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,320

I'm Ricky Javez with me Steven Merch. Hello there and it was the conservative leader David Cameron courtesy of the daily telegraph site

508
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:23,080
Thanks for listening. I hope I speak to you again on another podcast before long two days later

509
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:32,680
It was Tony Blair podcast by the son which said it was a significant a breakthrough as the first Prime Minister's radio broadcast by Ramsay McDonald in 1924

510
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:38,600
This is George Pasco Watson the son's political editor with the Prime Minister Tony Blair in the heart of Downing Street

511
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,440
With the son's first ever podcast and then last Friday

512
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,800
It was John Snow in Channel 4's first podcast a documentary about cannabis in the young

513
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,720
So basically it's the newspapers. It's the commercial television station very important

514
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,680
They're jumping on to it and like I got Tony Blair the doing and you know and it turns out that Ricky Javez

515
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:04,120
Actually went to the Guardian newspaper. They didn't ask him he went to them and said you know, would you enable this for me?

516
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,120
So he's probably not getting paid for it or number it much

517
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,520
So I thought that was really interesting

518
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:14,360
That's very interesting, but even more interesting. They released numbers. Are they getting it? Are they do they?

519
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,680
Well, it's typical BBC. It's government stuff. Of course they get it, but they're so fucking slow

520
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,920
It's like all the newspapers are already doing podcast. Well, that's why he said suddenly

521
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,880
Exactly like a boy doing suddenly. So such a this out for

522
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,000
They're December download numbers which is how a lot of this is being done now. So the best of moils

523
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,000
446,000 times

524
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:44,040
Today the today interview for in the 13,000 times the documentary archive. These are ones you talked about now

525
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,000
There's just 211 times and then it really starts to go down

526
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,360
Like go digital is 59,000 times and

527
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,960
Let's see the letter to gait like learners

528
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
2,796

529
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,800
We do more than that. We do much more than that

530
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,120
This show daily source code does more than their number one show in a month

531
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,080
So I just thought that was

532
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,080
Really fucking cool

533
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:16,360
No, no someone wants gay like that's nothing wrong. I'm just saying that if you look at the

534
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,640
You know what we're seeing now is the guys who've been doing radio for a hundred years

535
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,440
All right, you know suddenly getting into podcasts

536
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:30,360
The podcast is suddenly great, but they're not doing better than us. So look we're just on we're in a freaking cottage here

537
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,640
And we're doing more down

538
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,720
Significantly more downloads than than the BBC's top show. That was kind of the point

539
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:41,960
Interesting. Yeah, that's very interesting. I only have more of this crap. Do you want to you don't want to listen to all this?

540
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,520
Love a why not? Okay, good. Well because that's all right. So now

541
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,080
Oh, this is good. You'll like this. You know

542
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,760
Clear channel in America. Yeah, they own thousands of radio stations

543
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,560
I mean really thousands of radio stations

544
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,120
Which is is in most people would say

545
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:05,480
Radio sucks in America because of companies like Clear channel that have bought all these stations

546
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,840
They put one disjockey who then you know is you hear them on three or four different stations at the same time

547
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,040
So it's become very impersonal. Oh, yeah, and then so this is the big powerhouse, right?

548
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,960
This is a billion dollar company

549
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,960
Listened about because and they

550
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,680
Business week with the Heather Green. She does a podcast. She's interviewed me as well

551
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,280
She talked to the guy who's responsible for all the podcasting over at Clear channel at this huge

552
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,720
Conglomerate who's getting into podcasting listen to their download numbers

553
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,160
It's taking an entire show and making that available later and it proves to be a hit right out of the gate

554
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,400
We realize that our listeners were absolutely wanting to get our

555
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,720
content on their own terms and podcasting made that available so we slowly expanded and we now have

556
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,480
80 stations podcasting which is just a fraction of our total number of stations

557
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:01,960
But we added a couple of stations every week and we've already seen advertisers ranging from the local Mercedes dealer and

558
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,400
Phoenix Arizona to a an Apple shop in

559
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,560
You know, Ohio wanting to be a part of this as well. Yeah, I wanted to ask you about that

560
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,080
You know how you're what kind of business model you're you're using here

561
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,200
But I also wanted to back up and and talk a little bit about so

562
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:21,000
I mean, what have you learned about this podcast kind of podcast? I mean from this kind of podcast

563
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,640
What kind of what have you learned download so we um in the on demand content at at large

564
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,320
This was something new for radio stations to go on air and take go to our website

565
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,440
And you can get this content 24-7 was a brand new experience and it resonated right out of the gate

566
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:45,960
We saw our strip performances our sneak peek cd debuts all reaching audiences of upwards of of a hundred

567
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,600
Thousand and some of them several hundreds of thousand in in a very short period of time

568
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,440
So the demand for this was absolutely there like within a month or two months

569
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,400
Yeah, right right out of the gate with podcast in particular

570
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:04,280
We started with handful of stations we're now at 80 over the course of the last six six and a half months

571
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,360
We've already seen more than six and a half million podcasts

572
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,720
Okay

573
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:15,240
In the last six six and a half months. Yeah, we've already this is a publicly listed company by the way

574
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,440
So I don't I don't think the companies like that typically don't give out numbers about how successful they are

575
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:26,520
So just to put it into perspective he says six six and a half months. He's seen six million

576
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,040
Downloads the million

577
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,800
The daily source code and Dawn and Drew two shows do better than that. Yeah, just two shows

578
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,560
So these are the big it's the big clear channel incredible and listen it's not it's not podcast

579
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,320
It's like streaming stuff you know

580
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,960
We start to try and quantify where that no he thinks it's a big number actually and where comes from check

581
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,600
Okay, you mean download it or it's a combination. Remember what I mentioned was out of the gate

582
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,640
We kind of did podcasting one or one if you don't really know what podcasting is you can just dream it

583
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:03,720
You can download an MP3 or you can sign up for Tora says feet in the beginning what we found was more people were

584
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,840
Either downloading it or streaming it, but since then the the number of

585
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:15,640
Sign-ups fractual feeds has has eclips the other formats. Okay, so what's important about that

586
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,120
Is what he's basically saying is that more people are

587
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:26,200
Subscribing to their podcast and that now the more people listen to podcasts through subscribing because

588
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,880
All these clear channel programs and stations are always on the home page of iTunes

589
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,280
Yeah, well we're seeing is

590
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:40,920
Actually the ratio there's less people subscribed and more people just clicking around and listening and downloading and doing from websites

591
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,640
etc. So all all their new signups are clearly coming from iTunes

592
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,520
Right, and we're still kicking their ass

593
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,120
Yeah, with a two show

594
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,160
They will now

595
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,160
The numbers

596
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,160
He's so excited

597
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,720
Exactly these guys think that their shit don't stink and when I listen to how

598
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:08,040
That's what I mean did do they have the ears open? Do you know probably not probably not but I was just so amazing like my god

599
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,080
You know don't undo and daily source code do better than the BBC

600
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,400
Way better than the BBC and better than clear channel so you know it's our audience

601
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:23,400
They're in their little you know the only little world so imagine if you count up the 20,000 podcasts that are out there

602
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,640
How incredible the audience sizes. Yeah, just humongous amazing

603
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,920
I've told you about

604
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,480
Roger

605
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,480
Roger smallest oh

606
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,800
Yeah, you do he yeah. He's the guy that that drives around gulford

607
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:45,240
Oh, yeah, you told me yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Some people call him a stalker

608
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,560
But I think he's just a sweet kind of yeah, be careful. Yeah, you want to hear his latest podcast

609
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,920
the email in him complaining. Now I think he should all do I do and which is fairly

610
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:11,480
file safe and means you can quit I choose completely and that's all we need to do

611
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:17,680
set curie.com at your home page. Now that way every time you use the internet you

612
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,720
be able to see if happens recorded in the initial or not. And the bonus of course

613
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:26,600
you get see us in space at the top of his website wrap the day. I've noticed

614
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,600
that if you look very closely he keeps winking at you at the no have a

615
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:35,600
snow animation or not. I'm myself staring at that rate is actually at work it's

616
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,600
quite mesmerising I think in a certain night looks a sort of see that I

617
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,600
could just be me. So much like it's paralyzed and trying to communicate through

618
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,600
blinking it's probably just saying something I sense they are in law

619
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,600
code just with his eyes and eyes and mouth. You see the good thing about

620
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,600
is that he's a full community case now that whenever enough to school

621
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,600
is learning there up the best other must probably competing in some kind of

622
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,600
national right thing. But you've already got to my head and I'm sure I'm not

623
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,600
the only fan of that and I've been emailing him almost daily now for well

624
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:15,600
of the ten months just with thoughts, dreams or their comments and it's just nice

625
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:20,600
to play them now and not just ignore them. I'm then actually my first email

626
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,600
back from that then which is really really exciting I've got to hear actually

627
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:33,600
I can't say I've been using kind of things out of them.

628
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:40,600
Yes it is from aden at carry.com and this is to Roger and the school

629
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:46,600
Smalls on mail.co.uk and it's me. The secret is R.E. Please tell me where you

630
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,600
let Arden and you simply replied what now question

631
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,600
up which I think it's the time and so well we would say this

632
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,600
he still wants to know more information about what it is

633
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,600
because he's always got time for his fans. So I've been emailing him pretty much

634
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:07,600
ever since with this information, he shares Files family and him and I think he's

635
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:12,600
even said a special rule in his team helps them anything for me in a special area

636
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,600
Anyway I'm very flattered that a nice man called Jasper is written a thing

637
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,600
song about me for the daily source code. The last time someone wrote a song about me

638
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,600
I was a college at the time and it wasn't a particularly nice song

639
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,600
Unfortunately there aren't many words that rhyme with smalls. I seem to remember

640
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,600
that the lyrics were focusing mainly on my testicles. I'll leave that for which he is

641
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,600
because I have to get to bed. So have a good weekend.

642
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,600
So stop. On his testicles.

643
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Yeah because at school they made up songs about Roger Smalls and I'm sure it was like

644
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,600
has small balls.

645
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Sounds scary.

646
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,600
I'm not too worried about him.

647
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,600
If you're not.

648
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,600
I got a lot to do.

649
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,600
You want to hang out? Welcome to stay here.

650
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,600
No, I have to sit down now.

651
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,600
You're rubbing your tongue.

652
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
Yeah.

653
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,600
You don't feel good.

654
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,600
No, I'm still a bit lightheaded.

655
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,600
Yeah.

656
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,600
I'm sorry.

657
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:26,600
It's a combination of being said and we have a new sponsor on the network.

658
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,600
Accu view from the contact lenses.

659
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
Oh.

660
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,600
Yep. They're going to get the information. They're sponsoring.

661
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,600
We have those.

662
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,600
Yep. We're sponsoring a podcast.

663
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Which is Heather and Janelle.

664
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,600
So they're spot. They're underwriting an entire show by these two girls.

Alpha Charlie uniform Victor Uniform Echo.com.

667
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,600
And I'm going to get some free shit from them.

668
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,600
I want to get some lenses.

669
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,600
But you know what the biggest audience is?

670
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,600
The biggest audience for contact lenses is young girls.

671
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
That's why they're sponsoring this show with Heather and Janelle.

672
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Because they have bad eyes or to do that.

673
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
Just want to have other comments.

674
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Well, no, but think about it.

675
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
You're 15 years old.

676
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,600
Yeah, you don't want to wear glasses.

677
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,600
Thank you. So then, you know, what what more important.

678
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
You know, once you decide to go with a brand,

679
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,600
I think you're probably going to stay with that brand.

680
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Oh, actually Christina was mentioning that because she has bad eyes.

681
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Yeah, she wants lenses.

682
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,600
She said, I have to go. I want lenses.

683
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,600
Mom, because there's so many times that I don't see it.

684
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,600
Yeah.

685
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
But she doesn't want to put her glasses on.

686
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,600
Well, if she did her show, I bet you they would sponsor her.

687
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,600
You know, I think they they sponsor some other shows.

688
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
I think maybe Martina show.

689
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,600
Yeah.

690
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,600
But this is exactly the member when we did tampax.com.

691
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
Yeah, yeah.

692
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
Same thing.

693
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,600
Yeah.

694
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,600
Young women make a very important brand decision very early on.

695
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,600
You have a basically a couple of devices you can choose.

696
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
Yeah.

697
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
Yeah, too.

698
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,600
So why don't you go sit down, baby?

699
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Yeah.

700
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
I have to sit down.

701
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,600
All right. Thank you for having me, Mr. Gary.

702
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
Thank you, Mrs. Carl.

703
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
It's good to be back, baby.

704
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
Is tonight tonight?

705
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,600
I'm floating away now.

706
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Tonight is not the night.

707
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,600
No, you're floating.

708
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
Yes, you're floating, dude.

709
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,600
You're useless to me.

710
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,600
It's no good.

711
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,600
I love you, baby.

712
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
See you in a bit.

713
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
Bye.

714
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,600
Okay.

715
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,600
Oh.

716
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,600

Hi, this is Tony Starkler, Denison from the Roadhouse podcast.

730
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,600
The finest blues you've never heard.

731
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,600
You know, for the past 11 months, I've had the great privilege of bringing you music.

732
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,600
You'll never hear on commercial radio.

733
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,600
It really is the finest blues you've never heard because the suits and corporate radio

734
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,600
programmers just don't see where blues fits into their playlists.

735
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,600
But here's the deal.

736
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,600
The blues are back bigger than ever.

737
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,600
And we don't need radio at all.

738
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,600
Who stole my radio?

739
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Today we're about to break down the walls of our little shack by the crossroads

740
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,600
and make room for thousands of new listeners.

741
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,600
Today, the Roadhouse podcast is joined pod show

742
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:32,600
and the podcast delivering network to blow away any memories of mind-numbing corporate radio.

743
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:37,600
The Roadhouse and pod show.

744
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,600
Man, I'm thrilled to be here and I think you will be too.

745
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
It's an hour of the finest blues you've never heard.

746
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,600
The Roadhouse.

747
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,600
It's an hour of the finest blues you've never heard.

748
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,600
The Roadhouse.

749
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,600
Look for it at podshow.com.

750
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,600
Yeah, was a congratulations and welcome.

751
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,600
Roadshow.

752
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,600
The Roadhouse pod show.

753
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,600
The Roadhouse podcast.

754
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:11,600
You know, it was actually was Ron Bloom who really last onto that show early on.

755
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,600
He loves that podcast.

756
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,600
And so I'm sure he'll be happy to see that you've joined the network.

757
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,600
Very cool, dude.

758
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,600
Welcome.

759
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:26,600
Something a lot of people seem to be asking with all these announcements of podcasters

760
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,600
joining the network is actually it's not even a question.

761
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,600
It's more like a supposition that I'm reading more and more.

762
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,600
You know, where there's a comparison.

763
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,600
I don't know how anyone can make any kind of comparison

764
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:43,600
between basically added insertion networks and what we're doing.

765
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,600
But that's okay.

766
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,600
But the supposition is the right word, I think.

767
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,600
What people are just supposing is automatically fact is when you sign with podshow

768
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:58,600
that sign your life away and your copyrights and they tell you what to do on your show.

769
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,600
I just want you to know that that is not true.

770
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,600
And as we open up the network to everybody and anyone who wants to come in and join

771
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,600
and wants to help build the network.

772
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,600
Because it really only works if we work together, obviously.

773
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,600
You'll see that your show is your show.

774
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,600
What you say is what you say and your copyrights are yours.

775
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,600
So I just want to put that to rest.

776
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:25,600
Okay, so Friday, I'd already, you know, so we put the show up,

777
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,600
but already gotten the bad news about Jesse.

778
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:34,600
And then it was off to Google for our meeting there.

779
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,600
And here's something really interesting happened where we just got on the freeway

780
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,600
and we're on our way to Mountain View wherever it is.

781
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,600
And I get a phone call on my cell phone.

782
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:47,600
So pick it up and hey, it's, I forgot his name so and so.

783
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,600
From Apple.

784
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,600
Yeah, and it's not, it wouldn't be weird for me to get a call from Apple.

785
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
So I wasn't quite sure what the call was about.

786
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,600
I said, I'm calling about your power book.

787
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,600
I'm like, oh my God.

788
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,600
You know, all this bitching and moaning about about that audio stutter,

789
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,600
it's paying off.

790
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,600
So I'm like, yeah, it says, well, how is it?

791
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,600
I said, well, not too good.

792
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,600
You know, the story, he said, no, why don't you tell me?

793
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,600
So I go, I launched into this whole story about, you know, about what was wrong

794
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,600
and the issues and what Apple recommended temporarily.

795
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,600
He agreed and he said, no, that doesn't sound right.

796
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,600
Only having one audio application open.

797
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,600
That's not a fix.

798
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,600
I said, no, of course it's not a fix.

799
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:30,600
And then it slowly dawned on me that this guy is from sales support.

800
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,600
But he wasn't there to help me.

801
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,600
He was there to try and sell me apple care.

802
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,600
Because he went through this whole thing and then he says, right.

803
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,600
Hey, I see, yeah, that's really too bad.

804
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,600
You know, we should have that looked at.

805
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,600
I see you don't have apple care.

806
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,600
Are you still interested in purchasing that?

807
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,600
I said, well, no, I'm not.

808
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,600
You know, I don't give a shit about apple care.

809
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,600
You know, the shit's defective.

810
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,600
You know, I shouldn't have to pay extra money to have someone, you know,

811
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,600
at the genius bar card, apple pro or whatever.

812
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,600
It'll care pro, whatever it's called.

813
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,600
I have absolutely no desire to spend more money on you.

814
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,600
And he was like, okay.

815
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,600
I said, so what are you going to do about the problem I had?

816
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,600
So well, you know, I can just make a mention of it here in some in a comment field.

817
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,600
And I really don't know who looks at it from here on out.

818
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,600
I'm like, dude, this is so wrong.

819
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,600
So there you go.

820
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,600
It's how it works, I guess.

821
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,600
You know, I've got so much to go through.

822
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,600
I'm just going to keep going.

823
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,600
If you don't mind, it's Monday.

824
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,600
We haven't, we haven't caught up in a while.

825
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,600
And this, of course, is our own little private podcast moment.

826
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,600
No satellite listeners lurking on us.

827
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:43,600
And I do have some more, you know, basic podcasting stuff to discuss.

828
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,600
I've got an email from the, the pod chef, gastrocast.

829
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:53,600
There's a whole long thing about iTunes and how is feed broke.

830
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,600
And essentially, he wound up losing listeners anyway.

831
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,600
He says, because of iTunes, libson, and some bad technological lock.

832
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,600
I am now down 600 listeners.

833
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,600
I'm on the verge of some cool sponsorship.

834
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,600
And I need my subscribers back.

835
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:11,600
Would you please mention that the pod chefs, gastrocast, is available in iTunes of people search for gastrocast.

836
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,600
Okay, done.

837
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,600
I hope that works out for you, dude.

838
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,600
I've lost so many thousands of subscribers through iTunes shit, too.

839
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,600
It's unbelievable.

840
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,600
It really is, you know, just, you know, all of a sudden is like,

841
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,600
a group 20,000 drop off, and then, you know, in the course of like a week,

842
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,600
you can see these people literally re-subscribing.

843
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,600
Some of that may have to do with the, you know, the five download limit rule.

844
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,600
Something I really believe Apple should change, because, you know,

845
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:41,600
I'm constantly having to re-subscribe to any feed that has more than, you know,

846
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,600
that, or that has a high frequency of output because they come through.

847
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:49,600
And if you don't listen or watch in many case with video cast, watch, you know, five,

848
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,600
within five postings or five updates, then it stops downloading, you know,

849
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,600
it's a pain in the ass.

850
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,600
I think it's a good thing to have as a, as a preference,

851
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,600
but it should be something you could switch off.

852
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,600
This is definitely hurting the experience.

853
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:10,600
Speaking of video podcast, I think we got a sponsor for yeast radio,

854
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,600
particularly for Madge Weinstein's video cast,

855
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:18,600
and we're going to try and spread this sponsorship out over,

856
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,600
and it includes an actual video commercial, the amazing.

857
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,600
I've no idea what Madge is going to do with it,

858
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,600
but she's also going to spread it out amongst some of the queue potters,

859
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,600
and basically the whole, the whole Madge community.

860
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,600
So it'll be fantastic to see how that works and what they're going to do with it.

861
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,600
And I hear these commercials, I'm not going to give away who it is just yet,

862
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,600
but here the commercials were submitted for Super Bowl,

863
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,600
but were rejected because they were too, too racy.

864
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,600
So right on, that's perfect for us, I'd say.

865
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:50,600
Hey, ladies and gentlemen, first time I think I've noticed the second time

866
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,600
I've done this on the cast blaster, but it is.

867
00:46:53,600 --> 00:47:13,600
And I have some good news about the metro sexual moment.

868
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,600
This, you're not going to believe it.

869
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,600
This portion of the program will actually be sponsored.

870
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,600
It looks like this is sponsored.

871
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,600
It's really interested in underwriting the metro sexual moment.

872
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,600
So I'm down with that, and actually, I'm potting down the wrong thing.

873
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:35,600
Actually, the sponsor of the metro sexual moment is from a product that I use.

874
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,600
It's not a shaving, implement or anything like that.

875
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,600
It's nothing we've discussed in the metro sexual moment in our little corner here.

876
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,600
We're guys get together and just bring out some of our feminine side.

877
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,600
Corey Crook says, hey, Adam, I've been listening to your podcast for a while now.

878
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,600
Enjoy your metro sexual moment and all the things you were doing with potting music.

879
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,600
Never blah blah.

880
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:57,600
On the real me to the subject, I know you've had some ladies right in and talk about how they love the rugged

881
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,600
stubble look.

882
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,600
I always sport to look when I can, but it can only last for a few days, right?

883
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,600
Not true.

884
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,600
I was listening to the show when someone had written and recommended a wall.

885
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:11,600
Let's W-A-H-L-Beard-Trimmer with a short setting so you can keep the stubble look at all times.

886
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,600
Last Friday, I made my way to the store to see what I could find.

887
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:19,600
And in my amazement wall actually has a shaver that comes with a rugged stubble guide.

888
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,600
I immediately purchased it, works great.

889
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,600
I would recommend that to anyone that wants to keep the look all the time.

890
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:34,600
Well, I'd like to look personally, but as I think I've explained Patricia is definitely not turned on to the idea of stubble.

891
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,600
Hi Adam, right here with PathMinderCast.com.

892
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,600
Hey, I've been enjoying the Metro moment on your show and I've actually found it helpful.

893
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,600
I do have one question though about the facial moisturizer.

894
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,600
I looked at my girlfriend's bathroom cabinet and they've discovered several moisturizer.

895
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:52,600
I am anxious to try one, but I am afraid that if I start using moisturizers, it oils and then will increase my acne.

896
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,600
I am in my mid-20s and I still struggle with acne.

897
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,600
So should I stay away from these oils and creams and go with something so based?

898
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,600
If anyone has advice on what to do about acne, that would be great.

899
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,600
Thanks.

900
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:10,600
Dude, man, I'm so sorry that Patricia is not here anymore because she probably could have answered that better than I could, but I'll tell you one thing.

901
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,600
Soap is not particularly good for your face regardless.

902
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:23,600
So, you know, I think that you can probably pick up a moisturizer that will be specifically be for people with acne.

903
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,600
Those of the acne fate.

904
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:31,600
But we do have a lot of experience here in the cottage and I will get some information for you.

905
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,600
As you know, we have a 15 year old young lady here.

906
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:42,600
Let's just say, sometimes the mornings are not pleasant when something new has appeared that was undesired.

907
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:49,600
See, a David Shepel says, thought you'd enjoy this site, shavingstuff.com.

908
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,600
Yeah, I checked it out. Definitely interesting.

909
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,600
And Mark Bars.

910
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:01,600
What, huh?

911
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:06,600
Come here for a second. I need to do it anyway.

912
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,600
Yeah, it's a box for three.

913
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,600
For nothing.

914
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,600
And he just very upset.

915
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,600
No, that's realistic. Put the headphones on.

916
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,600
I got a guy who needs some help.

917
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,600
We're in the metro sexual moment here.

918
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,600
Okay.

919
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,600
Okay. Let's I'll play it again.

920
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,600
Listen to this.

921
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,600
Hey, I've been enjoying the metro moment on your show and have actually found it helpful.

922
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,600
I do have one question though about the facial moisturizers.

923
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,600
I looked at my girlfriend's bathroom cabinet and have discovered several moisturizers.

924
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:36,600
I am anxious to try one, but I am afraid that if I start using moisturizers, the oils and them will increase my acne.

925
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,600
I am in my mid-20s and I still struggle with acne.

926
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,600
So should I stay away from these oils and creams and go with something so-based?

927
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:46,600
If anyone has advice on what to do about acne, that would be great.

928
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,600
Thanks.

929
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,600
So this is about shaving.

930
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,600
Yeah, we've talked about you have to moisturize after shaving.

931
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,600
It's the hormone here on the metro sexual moment.

932
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,600
So you're the expert on skin care.

933
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,600
So what should you do?

934
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,600
He's worried that using moisturizer will be bad for his acne.

935
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,600
Well, he has a girlfriend.

936
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:09,600
If she has moisturizes, doesn't she know anything about facial...

937
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:14,600
Sometimes it's very difficult for men to talk about that with their girlfriends.

938
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,600
That's why we have the metro sexual moment.

939
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:21,600
If he has acne, really acne, or I don't know how old he is.

940
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,600
Could you just answer the question?

941
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,600
No, because there's different.

942
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,600
No, it doesn't.

943
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,600
If he has acne because it will never go away.

944
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,600
He doesn't.

945
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,600
And he has it for a long time.

946
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,600
Or is he just in his...

947
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,600
He's 20.

948
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,600
He's 20.

949
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,600
So he's still growing.

950
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,600
Yeah.

951
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,600
Yeah.

952
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:43,600
Well, he can go to his doctor and ask for a special moisturizer.

953
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,600
Special creams, special things for acne.

954
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,600
Very good.

955
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:55,600
But he doesn't have acne, but she has a little bit of teenage pimples and things.

956
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,600
Uh-huh.

957
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,600
There's very good stuff.

958
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,600
But you have to ask your doctor.

959
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,600
Dermatologist.

960
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,600
Dermatologist or your doctor.

961
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,600
Okay.

962
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,600
And there's always something for you skin.

963
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,600
But do something about it.

964
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,600
If you really are upset about it, do something about it.

965
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,600
You don't need to walk around with it.

966
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,600
All right.

967
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,600
All right.

968
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,600
Thank you.

969
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,600
You're welcome.

970
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,600
Now, can you keep that dog quiet?

971
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,600
No.

972
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,600
I'm sorry.

973
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,600
I don't mind.

974
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,600
I don't mind.

975
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,600
I don't mind.

976
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,600
It's okay.

977
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,600
You didn't hear me complaining.

978
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,600
He's upset.

979
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,600
And he's a bit nervous.

980
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,600
It's okay, baby.

981
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,600
All right.

982
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,600
Thank you.

983
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,600
We all thank you.

984
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,600
Here at the Metro Sexual Moment.

985
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,600
And then finally, Mark Barr.

986
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,600
So I was once in the floor to Mallon Orlando.

987
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,600
And a lady at one of those little booths in the middle called me.

988
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,600
Usually, I say, no, thank you.

989
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,600
But this lady was really pretty.

990
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,600
So I decided to listen to her marketing story.

991
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:47,600
She asked me for my hand.

992
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,600
But just to use a nail buffer on it, make one of my nails really nice and shiny in seconds.

993
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,600
I got one of their nail kits.

994
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,600
And I used the buffer and cuticle oil every other week.

995
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,600
I work as a systems admin.

996
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,600
Sometimes have to help users out.

997
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,600
I did receive a couple of compliments from female workers when I was working on their keyboards.

998
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,600
Then my hands and nails are so nice.

999
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,600
So besides the shaving and moisturizer, maybe it's time to include the other body parts

1000
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,600
in the Metro Sexual Moment.

1001
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,600
The nail kits are sold on the internet.

1002
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,600
Not sure if they are all the same.

1003
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:16,600
With my experience with magift and swiss up beauty sensation are good.

1004
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,600
This last one also has nice body lotions, but they smell a bit feminine.

1005
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,600
So I don't use them on work days.

1006
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,600
Man, I wish I could quit my day job in podcasts every day while smelling.

1007
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,600
Yeah, of course.

1008
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,600
Well, listen.

1009
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,600
I too have manicures done.

1010
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,600
And I haven't done it in a while, but I do take care of my nails.

1011
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,600
And I found that it's actually kind of fun to go with Patricia.

1012
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,600
There's a place where, you know, it's like a Korean nail shop.

1013
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,600
And we both get our nails done.

1014
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,600
And yes, you know what?

1015
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,600
It is appreciated.

1016
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:49,600
There's nothing more disgusting than having a cis admin with really cruddy, nasty ass fingernails,

1017
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,600
touching your keyboard.

1018
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,600
And you're right.

1019
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,600
Women totally groove on a nice groom nails.

1020
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,600
And I'm curious, Metro Sexual Moment.

1021
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,600
Yeah.

1022
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,600
Okay.

1023
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,600
That's it for our Metro Sexual Moment.

1024
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,600
What else do we have on the menu for today?

1025
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,600
Using two computers.

1026
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,600
I'm using, uh, I said the Mac to keep track of everything.

1027
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,600
Okay.

1028
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,600
A couple of audio comments that I wanted to get through.

1029
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,600
Uh, let me see.

1030
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,600
Let's try this one.

1031
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,600
I add them.

1032
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,600
Nope.

1033
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:21,600
Just a brief correction on a statement you made while reading my email on DSC319.

1034
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,600
Just to refresh your memory and that of your listeners.

1035
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,600
I wrote about my having correspondent with Jody Shelton's manager, Audrey Brandt.

1036
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:34,600
In one of my emails to her, I suggested that they register Jody at the PMN.

1037
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,600
She did and that part of the reading was cool.

1038
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,600
Then after that, you stated.

1039
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,600
Uh, looks like he's, uh, thinking about doing a podcast himself.

1040
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,600
Very cool.

1041
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,600
Okay.

1042
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,600
Ed from Ed's Mixbag.

1043
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,600
Thank you so much.

1044
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:53,600
Guess it was the way I signed my email with the podcast name at the end after my name.

1045
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,600
But just one of the clear things up.

1046
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:00,600
Ed's Mixbag has been a labor of love since October 6, 2005.

1047
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:06,600
And to date, I've done 16 shows and plenty of promos for the podcast as well as for fellow

1048
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,600
podcasters.

1049
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:14,600
Sweepers and bumpers come to mind for Dan Johnson of journey inside my mind and also a joint

1050
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,600
effort between myself and Kevin of the first person show.

1051
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:23,600
The mic tech show also comes to mind for whom I've done a short promo or two.

1052
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:29,600
My robot friend Sydney and Mary have also helped out and are expected to sound off on

1053
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,600
rhythm angels rocking blast cast very soon.

1054
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:38,600
I know Adam that you deal with so many listeners and podcasters that it's next to impossible

1055
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,600
to be accurate all the time.

1056
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,600
Hence this little audio comment.

1057
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:46,600
And if I might, just one more thing from the shameless PR department.

1058
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,600
Hey, Adam, this is Sydney.

1059
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,600
Thanks for giving it this time.

1060
00:55:52,600 --> 00:56:00,600
If you would be so kind as to have to record listeners to eat and eat.litson.com

1061
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:05,600
wherever you empty stands for it's next bag.

1062
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:12,600
That's stuff you WW dot eat and eat.litson.com.

1063
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,600
Thanks again, Adam.

1064
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,600
Yeah, no problem.

1065
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:20,600
Patricia just walked in during that little promo and handed me a bottle of a brand called

1066
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,600
Dermalagica.

1067
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:27,600
A skincare system resorts and developed by the International Dermal Institute.

1068
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,600
Dermalagica.

1069
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,600
There you go.

1070
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,600
She said they have a whole line of stuff and that might be what you want to use for acting.

1071
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,600
Oh my gosh.

1072
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,600
Aren't we just on the tip of all the stuff today?

1073
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,600
Hello.

1074
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,600
He had him David Martin with Planet podcast down here in Los Angeles.

1075
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,600
Long time listter.

1076
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:48,600
And I think this is the first time I've responded to your show.

1077
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,600
I think it was because your Friday source code kind of hit a nerve.

1078
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,600
In the show you talked about a tabloid that exposed your family.

1079
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,600
And I had a bit of a flashback.

1080
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,600
Before I got into making internet applications and podcasting,

1081
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,600
I was an independent recording artist.

1082
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,600
And I had a tabloid publication.

1083
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,600
Do a similar thing to my family.

1084
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,600
And it was a horrifying experience.

1085
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:19,600
Back then, all we could do is pick up our lives and change our personal information,

1086
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,600
which I know you've had to go through.

1087
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,600
Just want to let you know that we support you down here in L.A.

1088
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:31,600
And I will personally take up donations to help fight these low-life bottom feeders.

1089
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:37,600
What I'm more really impressed about Adam is how you spoke about these jerks on your show.

1090
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,600
You didn't give them what they want.

1091
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,600
And that was to have their name mentioned on your show.

1092
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:48,600
I hope that everyone from podcasts,

1093
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:54,600
to radio, TV, newspaper, all media takes a lesson from you.

1094
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,600
Way to take the high road.

1095
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,600
After all, one of my mentors once said,

1096
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:03,600
let's let them be the skunk at the backyard party.

1097
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,600
Keep the faith that, Adam.

1098
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,600
We're all with you, man.

1099
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,600
Thanks.

1100
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,600
And it's really just true.

1101
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:13,600
You know, I'm suing this magazine for a number of reasons,

1102
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:19,600
but the one that I think is is most relevant is for using my pictures from flicker,

1103
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,600
publishing them in a magazine with a reasonable circulation.

1104
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:27,600
And these pictures are protected on the creative comments copyright,

1105
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,600
specifically the share-like non-commercial attribution.

1106
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,600
Non-commercial means is non-commercial.

1107
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,600
Now here's what's interesting.

1108
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,600
I have a lot of lawyers who have emailed me about this

1109
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:43,600
and are watching this because I guess there hasn't really been a real case

1110
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,600
that went to court, certainly not internationally.

1111
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,600
You know, of an example like this.

1112
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,600
And usually you hear about the other way around,

1113
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,600
because oh boy, if I took a picture from a magazine and put it on my weblog,

1114
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,600
boy, how long would it take for me to get my ass sued off?

1115
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,600
Well, that would go pretty quick as you can imagine.

1116
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,600
So the other way around should work equally as well.

1117
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:06,600
But what's interesting is even though lots of lawyers are contacting me,

1118
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,600
no one from creative comments.

1119
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,600
And there's a, there's a Dutch chapter of creative comments.

1120
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:16,600
And they're very busy working with Buma Stemran, all these other right organizations.

1121
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:20,600
But I really hope that they do pay attention to this particular suit,

1122
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:25,600
because this is going to prove that, you know, how it all works.

1123
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,600
You know, it's going to, we have an capability here to put something into the,

1124
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:34,600
into the public eye and ear that is very new and novel and people will be interested about.

1125
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:39,600
And, you know, grab your chance guys in Holland with your, because I'm suing in the Netherlands,

1126
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:44,600
not in the UK, some people thought it was suing in the UK.

1127
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:49,600
I just hope it's not like, you know, I was in the early days when MTV.com,

1128
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,600
I'd registered that.

1129
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,600
That's a whole long story.

1130
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:57,600
But of course, you know, when MTV, when I quit and when MTV decided,

1131
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,600
well, let's sue this guy for that name.

1132
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:06,600
I contacted EFF, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, specifically John Perry Barlow.

1133
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,600
And they wouldn't help me. They would not fucking help me.

1134
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:14,600
And I think I thought, well, here's, this is a huge domain, the first domain dispute.

1135
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:20,600
What a fantastic opportunity to bring forward, you know, the value of it, et cetera, just,

1136
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,600
all these things that we, whether I was right or wrong is irrelevant.

1137
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:25,600
They would not get involved.

1138
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:30,600
Now, it was so disappointed by that that I, I've never really looked at much the EFF is doing.

1139
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:35,600
You know, it's like, all right, when it comes down to it, when it comes down to an individual case,

1140
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,600
then you're kind of on your own.

1141
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,600
So I'm hoping this is not going to be the case with creative commons.

1142
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:44,600
And, uh, definitely hoping that word will get around and that, you know,

1143
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:48,600
will, you know, people will keep their eye on it, because I think this is really important stuff.

1144
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:53,600
Now, man, are we just making this a freaking massive long show or what?

1145
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,600
Yeah, mine as well.

1146
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,600
A couple more things before I go.

1147
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,600
Darren Wall says, okay, totally freaked out here.

1148
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,600
Listening to Delta Sierra Charlie 308.

1149
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,600
Yeah, I've got some catching up to do.

1150
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,600
Just after you read about the RIA going after the Girl Scouts, you said,

1151
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,600
I Barbara, come on in.

1152
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,600
You know, you can say something, you know.

1153
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,600
This was just as my wife, Barbara entered the room.

1154
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,600
She stared wide eyed at me.

1155
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:19,600
I think she thought I wasn't Skype to get you getting my own private live,

1156
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,600
DSC happy new year to the Curry crew from Darren and Barbara.

1157
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,600
Thanks, guys.

1158
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,600
Well, you know, that is freaking actually.

1159
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,600
But it's cool.

1160
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,600
Kind of cool that way.

1161
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:33,600
Lots of people have asked me about Mark Hunter's Tartan podcast.

1162
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,600
And, you know, has he left Podshow?

1163
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,600
What's going on?

1164
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,600
Yes.

1165
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:43,600
We had brought him into the network as a part of the music podcast.

1166
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:48,600
There's also also make up the podcast, the Podshow Music Review,

1167
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,600
the weekly review of what the music podcasts are playing.

1168
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:56,600
And he basically, you know, said that he didn't want the commitment anymore.

1169
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:00,600
And he wanted to be let out of his agreement, which we did.

1170
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,600
And I wish him all the best, obviously.

1171
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,600
And totally get it.

1172
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,600
Totally understand it.

1173
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:09,600
And so I think his frequency of shows will be somewhat less than it has been today.

1174
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,600
But I remain subscribed.

1175
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,600
And I'll be listening.

1176
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,600
And Steve Harris says, Adam, notice your cast blaster set up.

1177
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,600
Doesn't include all the usual ID3 tags.

1178
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,600
You wouldn't notice this if he used iTunes to subscribe because it

1179
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,600
fills them in when you download.

1180
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,600
But I'm a net news wire guy.

1181
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,600
Well, I found out what that was.

1182
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:29,600
I indeed, the under-describe in cast blaster.

1183
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,600
There's a thing for show.

1184
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:39,600
Now, I've been testing the new version, which works with the Podshow podcast delivery network.

1185
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:43,600
And when you, basically, you log into the network with cast blaster.

1186
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,600
And you can have a number of shows.

1187
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,600
And it's a drop down menu and you just select it.

1188
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:53,600
And then it knows automatically where to post the show notes and where to upload the file to.

1189
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:58,600
Unfortunately, with all this testing and moving around, that got deselected.

1190
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,600
So now I've re-selected it.

1191
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:05,600
It's got the daily source code there in the show name, which should show up in the album field of the ID3 tag.

1192
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,600
So thanks.

1193
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,600
A couple other people let me know about that as well.

1194
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,600
So I totally appreciate it.

1195
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,600
Check this audio feedback now.

1196
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,600
This is from the Podance.

1197
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,600
Look.

1198
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,600
Return one of my calls, please.

1199
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,600
I heard episode 2019.

1200
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,600
You drunk, man.

1201
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,600
I mentioned our name.

1202
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,600
It was in the United States.

1203
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,600
It's a delivery network, partner.

1204
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,600
Bro, I'm screwed.

1205
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:33,600
I got so many members of the media called me over the weekend.

1206
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,600
I mean, you read the press release for that thing yet.

1207
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:40,600
Dude, I got to get, you got to put the no-dam announcements

1208
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,600
rule back in effect.

1209
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,600
Chris is on the road.

1210
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,600
I mean, we can't handle this right now.

1211
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,600
Give me a week to get the news out.

1212
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:55,600
I mean, Jesus, killing me.

1213
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,600
Seriously.

1214
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,600
If it comes to it, I will...

1215
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:05,600
You know, if you keep talking about this, I'm going to get desperate.

1216
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,600
I'm going to go get Chris Rockwell and a bunch of Mexican food.

1217
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,600
We're going to break into Trinity and do our own damn biodiesel experiment.

1218
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,600
Huh?

1219
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,600
How does that sound?

1220
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,600
It's getting a little crazy on the Sunday night.

1221
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,600
You're pit, this pissed.

1222
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,600
And you better return a brother's phone call in a hurry.

1223
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,600
All right?

1224
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:27,600
That's Aaron Bursell.

1225
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,600
The Pod Pimp marketing communications at Pod Show.

1226
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:35,600
I mentioned that we've partnered with Limelight for the Pod Show podcast delivery network.

1227
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:36,600
Okay.

1228
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,600
I promise I won't talk about Limelight until at least next week.

1229
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,600
All right.

1230
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:43,600
All right.

1231
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,600
Final thing for today in the hook a brother up category.

1232
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,600
How do you pick my care?

1233
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,600
This is a quick step aside from the exercise we'll actually show.

1234
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,600
I just want to let you know about my band's tour.

1235
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,600
The freak accident we're going on the road with...

1236
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,600
Vancouver's removal.

1237
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:12,600
Seven ugly guys and too many vans tour.

1238
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,600
Here's our tour dates.

1239
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:21,600
Thursday January 26th will be in Seattle at the sunset tavern on Ballard Avenue.

1240
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:27,600
For right-day we'll be in Tacoma, Washington at Hell's Kitchen.

1241
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:34,600
Saturday, January 28th will be in Richland, Washington at Ray's Golden Lion.

1242
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,600
On Sunday we'll be in Portland at Syballas.

1243
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,600
On Hawthorn.

1244
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:48,600
Monday, January 30th will be in Salem, Oregon at SIP.

1245
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:52,600
And we'll be playing with the Cherry City Deadmeats.

1246
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,600
That's an all-age show, by the way.

1247
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,600
Tuesday, let's see.

1248
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:02,600
Eugene, we're playing at either the Samurai Duck or the Black Forest.

1249
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:07,600
It's not sure which, with a band called Some What Envious.

1250
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:12,600
And then we'll be back home in San Francisco where we'll be playing on Wednesday the first

1251
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,600
at the elbow room with the fleshes.

1252
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:18,600
This is the all these shows are with removal as well.

1253
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:22,600
Then Thursday February 2nd will be in Berkeley at the Starry Plow.

1254
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:26,600
That one's with Kyoto Nation.

1255
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:31,600
Then we'll be Friday we'll be over in Sacramento at all the iron sights.

1256
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:37,600
And Saturday February 4th will be the last show in Poin Arena.

1257
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:45,600
And that's at the VFW Hall with Lockjaw.

1258
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,600
So, if you're out there, come check out our shows.

1259
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:52,600
It's going to be fun.

1260
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:56,600
I'm also going to be doing extra super actual show updates.

1261
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:00,600
The freak accident is going to be on its own feed.

1262
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,600
Still not sure how we're going to do all this, but we're going to do it.

1263
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,600
Until then, I say to you.

1264
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:11,600
But I don't speak Chinese.

1265
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:18,600
So I'll just never understand why you don't have any more.

1266
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:22,600
And why your boyfriend wants to kill me.

1267
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:26,600
Can I watch this film?

1268
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:32,600
And for in the morning, when I have to kill work.

1269
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:36,600
So I can't hear me on the plane.

1270
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:40,600
So I can have a push to see.

1271
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,600
Or not depending.

1272
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,600
I'm always playing at the multiplex.

1273
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:50,600
And what is playing at the movies?

1274
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:55,600
I need a Chinese phrase book.

1275
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:16,600
A bit of freak accident there and some tour date announcements from Big Mike extra super action show.

1276
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:21,600
I played those because I realized that back in the day, even on MTV, we used to do tour dates.

1277
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,600
We had the concert guide.

1278
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,600
And he used to be a big thing.

1279
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:31,600
Of course, now with the web, it's much easier for people to just look at that information up online.

1280
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,600
You hear from it in a multitude of ways.

1281
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,600
But I was kind of cool.

1282
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,600
The big Mike went back old school.

1283
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,600
So I wanted to make sure he got some good distribution on the tour dates.

1284
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,600
And I think I might be able to catch one of the shows.

1285
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,600
Actually, I caught kind of one of the shows at the Pod Show offices.

1286
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,600
When was Ron's birthday freak accident performed.

1287
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:55,600
On what we used to call the stage, what is now known as conference room too.

1288
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,600
We put the wall in finally, so we can't have him perform there next time.

1289
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:02,600
Anyway, if you made it through this entire show, and I think this is some sort of a record.

1290
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,600
68 minutes.

1291
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,600
I really appreciate it.

1292
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:05,600
I hope you enjoyed it.

1293
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:10,600
Of course, Patricia made it go long because she popped in, but it was cool to have her on the show again.

1294
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,600
And I'll be back tomorrow with another daily source code.

1295
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,600
So in the meantime, keep your promos coming.
