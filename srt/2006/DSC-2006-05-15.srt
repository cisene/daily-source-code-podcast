Delta Sierra Charlie 3-8-7, portions of this podcast are not family safe.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,240
You want answers?

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,180
I think I'm entitled to them.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,740
You want answers?

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,340
I want the truth.

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,340
You can't handle the truth.

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:36,900
Sun we live in a world that has artists and those artists have to be promoted by other artists

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,900
with podcasts.

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,060
Who's gonna do it?

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,060
You?

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,860
You, Mr. Record, exact?

15
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:48,180
I have greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom.

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,180
You weep for the old days and you curse the internet.

17
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,340
You have that luxury.

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,940
You have the luxury of not knowing what I know that the ability to play music in podcasts

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,620
while tragic in your view.

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:09,700
Probably sold back catalog and in my existence while grotesque and incomprehensible to you

21
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,220
still sold back catalog.

22
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:17,460
You don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about it parties,

23
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,420
you want me on the internet.

24
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,700
You need me on the internet.

25
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,740
We use words like free and download and pod safe.

26
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,340
We use these words as the backbone to a lifespan promoting something.

27
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,700
You use them as a punchline.

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,900
I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps

29
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,540
under the blanket of the very revenues that I create for you, then questions the man

30
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,260
or in which I provide them.

31
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,420
I'd rather you just said thank you and went on your way.

32
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,060
Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a domain name and produce a podcast.

33
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,540
Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you're entitled to.

34
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,940
Did you order the song play?

35
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,300
I did the job you sent me to do.

36
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,100
Do you order the song play?

37
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,820
You're damn right, I did.

38
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:42,180
My favorite sits waste, I run with the kick eyes, I'll be forced to cast those.

39
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:52,340
I don't think we picked up a song, I'll sing it from the mountain, just take it to the top.

40
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:59,100
I'll scream it till my left heart, I'll stand here till I drive.

41
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:09,500
The feeling is leaving, it's so cold, it's the sleeping, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice.

42
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:39,460
I know you're hating me, and you can't shed it, you'll make a rush out of my body, no matter how I can seek you, you'll be so special, now I hold all the time.

43
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,940
You think the same of me, just take it to the top.

44
00:03:45,940 --> 00:04:00,740
The feeling is leaving, it's so cold, it's the sleeping, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice.

45
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:30,740
I know you're hating me, and you can't shed it, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, if we don't stop, if we don't stop, if we don't stop, if we don't stop, if we don

46
00:04:30,740 --> 00:05:00,740
do, if we don't stop, we'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, you'll be in a cup of juice, and now, if we don't stop, if we don't stop, if we don't stop, if we don't stop, if we don't stop, if we don't stop, if we don

47
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:30,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

48
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:47,840
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah controls,

49
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,920
And of course you're gonna be along for the ride. I've been waiting for for a new Danko Jones song to go pod safe and here it is

50
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,720
Came on the network May 12. These guys from Canada didn't actually realize that

51
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,880
I just I'm sorry sorry, but it's the cowbell is kind of my version of DRM actually

52
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,560
You know if I put that in there then I'll know if you copy the song illegally

53
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,160
Jeffrey Sheafer says Adam and Joy Thursday show and a previous show you were talking about subliminal programming or was it micro-programming?

54
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,680
Using the sense sale moment as an example a new-old linguistic programming actually NLP

55
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,640
I can totally see where you're coming from but have you ever stopped to think about the results of unintentional programming?

56
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,440
After you show I was listening to Jethro Tulls, Minstrel in the gallery and a cowbell kicked in

57
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,840
I kept waiting for you to chime in with oh yeah

58
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,080
Oh yeah, I was completely disappointed with Tulls lack of foresight

59
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,280
Where are you when I need you man? Oh, maybe I should create a special little cowbell

60
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,160
Jingle you can play next thing you know I'll be talking with the boys when I come home from work

61
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,960
Okay, well you'd have to talk to Patricia about that first obviously

62
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,920
A little weekend update. Let's see

63
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,040
Rather well kind of un-eventful or

64
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,160
Expected Friday afternoon I had a date with Captain Dan

65
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,200
You know we've been we've only really seen each other flying together and we decided we'd go up to

66
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,520
Dunsfold airfield which is about 15 minutes away from the cottage and ge offered in the lovely United Kingdom

67
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,120
This is where they filmed top gear and apparently they've a hack well the it's an old airfield

68
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:28,480
It's where the harrier jump jet was developed and built and tested and the airfield is still used and so we decided to go up there and check out see what's going on

69
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,680
And indeed there's a huge hanger with

70
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,280
Probably about 25 aircraft in it

71
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:42,240
Plenty of space of course no services no fuel no, you know no guy to pull the cut the the plane out of the hanger for you

72
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,640
We'll put it back in which I enjoy so much at Fair Oaks

73
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,400
That's it's there early in the show. Excuse me

74
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,360
But you know we walked around and it's a huge development this Dunfold park estates

75
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,840
Where the 80 companies there but I really got the impression they were quite straightforward about it actually

76
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,680
That they don't intend to uphold the aviation nature of the airfield in fact

77
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,720
McLaren tests their their cars there

78
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,520
Mercedes has a test unit that's on on base

79
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,960
They use it for the most recent what they use it for

80
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,720
Da Vinci code they shot several scenes there and they were actually preparing for the new James Bond movie

81
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
So they had an old cop car

82
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
a New York cab car

83
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,000
a couple of what looked to be like fuel trucks with

84
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,240
You know explosive devices on the side to you know give us a certain visual effect but not really destroy the cars themselves

85
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,560
And so you know nothing and and besides some restriction like you can't fly in

86
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,640
On Saturdays after a 3 p.m. or Sunday at all like well, that's not gonna work because of course the next day

87
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,440
Saturday Captain Dan and I hopped in 9 a.m. wheels up

88
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,080
Off to Rotterdam go see my mom my two sisters were there

89
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,920
So the flight itself was pretty unadventful although I must say

90
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,880
I must say that I'm getting pretty damn good at the instruments shit is really starting to come together for me

91
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,160
And since I still didn't have the GPS updated properly

92
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm pretty much flying on the VORs which are these radio beacons

93
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,200
Which it's very old fashioned but it works so well you tune it to a certain frequency and this thing this

94
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:22,480
Beacon this VOR is sending out a signal and then basically a needle points to where the signals coming from and so you know exactly

95
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,280
Which direction you're headed sound simple enough right?

96
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,560
Except you got to do a lot of changing of frequencies and talking to control towers and really I'm flying instruments

97
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,480
Which is pretty cool. Yeah, I mean I don't have the hood on or anything and I'm and I'm still looking around and enjoying a little bit of the view

98
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,880
But yeah, pretty good. It's I'm improving and once again I I can safely say that

99
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,800
It'll be a long while before I finish the book of aviation

100
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,800
Cranky that is it's one big ass book

101
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,680
So Rotterdam

102
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,680
Tuxi Core was there to pick me up

103
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,600
Who was I has told you he's my my ground services unit now takes care of everything for me

104
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,520
Drop me off will I was in from Italy Tiffany was there

105
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,080
Mom not doing too well, but she she knew she had to go back into the hospital

106
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,320
But she was gonna go for today from Monday

107
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,240
But she definitely just wanted to be home when all three of us were there and it was nice for us

108
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,240
We hadn't seen each other in several months all at the same time

109
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,200
It was pretty funny, you know because we're all sitting there going like well you know well

110
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,720
Where are we at we're standing in the kitchen and

111
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,920
It was just it was for the first time in a long long time that you know

112
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,880
Here are my two sisters, you know the 38 they're 40

113
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,920
Once 38 once 40 I'm almost 42 and I like dude

114
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,080
We're like all grown up now and we have all this grown-up shit and yeah that things happen to our family too

115
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,160
And what was and so I'm the I'm the the oldest of the three and so you know

116
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,800
And I'm trying to come up with some very something very profound and

117
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,080
I got off on the right foot and I had their attention and then I kind of wound up with so

118
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
What the fuck

119
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:17,200
And the and it's hard to you had to be there, but it was a moment that the kind of work and so now our family slogan is what the fuck

120
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,760
Sorry if I offend you with that we don't use it in public all the time

121
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:29,920
But mom was a definitely has pain and and they've got to figure out some way to manage that in the best ways to do it in the hospital

122
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,760
So she went in yesterday Sunday on Mother's Day go figure

123
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,920
Willow broader into the hospital and so they're gonna do a blood transfusion today

124
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,040
I believe which is really good because that'll make that you know

125
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,520
Look people go to Switzerland to get these all the time it makes you feel really good and refreshed

126
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,400
And then they're gonna work on the pain management and they hope to have her home in a couple of days and we hope so too

127
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
Okay, now

128
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,680
Anything else? Oh of course

129
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
So a flight back of course

130
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,680
Unadventful as well lots of

131
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,040
Cameo's name was cloud so we had some bumpy weather, but it was fun

132
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,560
It's always fun when you have to switch frequencies when you're bouncing up and down. It's a good workout

133
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,960
concentration hand-eye coordination

134
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,920
Um, I got home

135
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,520
Chilled out and I finally figured out the GPS stuff. I was able to hook a I post it a note on curry.com

136
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,880
And I was able to get my aviation GPS loaded with European nav data

137
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,480
Although just for the geeks amongst us for a second I definitely boneed myself because I bought this

138
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
It's one of my favorite GPS units

139
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,520
It's the the 195 by Garmin, which is it's old fashioned and it's black and white, but it's sturdy and you can drop it

140
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:51,280
You can haul it a long it just feels really good, you know, and you can also use it as an anti-terrorist device and wax them over oh someone over the head easily

141
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,880
And I I bought it off of eBay and I was really happy with it. Remember that a couple months ago, actually

142
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,880
And I was just waiting for a ticket to get over here and have that have the yoke mount installed and everything

143
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,520
And it turns out that the actual the the land data so the late, you know the actual mapping data

144
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,800
You can't use or configure that you either buy a European one or you buy an American one

145
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:20,720
So of course I got an American one because I got it off of eBay and you can't change that so I have nav data in there, which is good only I can't I there's no map data in it. So

146
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,960
Frustrating I'll just have to wait until

147
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,640
Until we really have something to celebrate and I buy a

148
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,000
430 and tied into a super luxurious

149
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,680
Autopilot system

150
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,680
One day always have something to look forward to

151
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,640
Speaking of flying

152
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,040
Here's a first from the divorce mail phone lines

153
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,200
Hello gentlemen from the cockpit like take a moment now and welcome you aboard

154
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:55,120
We have live a lot but 1,000 feet flying time today is four hours 21 minutes to Ontario, California

155
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,440
Oh, and speaking in the wrong microphone here. Sorry Adam

156
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,600
Yes, I'm sitting in the cockpit here and I know you had to comment earlier about being the first of everything

157
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,800
So that's how to be the first to give you a call from the cockpit

158
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,800
Sitting in my trusty speed the 757 on my way to Ontario, California

159
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,240
Long flight today. It's gonna be beautiful though. Did want to call and say hi?

160
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:27,120
We'll show you listeners all the best. This is Robin from Insightworks.com. It's IN has YTWLRKS

161
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,120
I've got Com. So long

162
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,400
And tailwinds dude. I think that is a first

163
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
Actually to do a promo from

164
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,640
From the cockpit. Yeah, and did you hear that by the way now? I met Robin and this is a true true avator

165
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,400
Real arman listen listen to how he says just listen to the inflection in his voice when he says

166
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:54,000
It's gonna be beautiful because he really means that and then and there's something about flying above the world

167
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,200
That that does affect you emotionally. Let me see if I can find it

168
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Find it

169
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,040
The 757 on my way to Ontario, California

170
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,920
Long flight today. It's gonna be beautiful though. Did you hear that? Yeah. It's gonna be beautiful though. Oh, almost like it was in love

171
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,520
All right cool well if you're at

172
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,080
37 38 thousand feet you can give us a call. That's real easy

173
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Voice mail numbers and there's no greeting so don't be surprised if you get the tinny mechanical voice saying leave your message or send your facts

174
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,480
In New Jersey 201 625 6357 or in London

175
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,480
O207 681 3753

176
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,080
And that by the way I've been told by many is the correct way to separate the digits in the UK

177
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,720
O20 for London 7681 3753

178
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,000
Kind of really interesting one this is this is where

179
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,480
This is where the show is gonna get pretty interactive for a moment here and I'm kind of

180
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,280
Joining you know

181
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,600
This is already a track in progress, but I felt like when I got this next comment

182
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,080
I listened to it. I'm like oh, yeah

183
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:13,040
I think I think the daily source code listeners will want to get involved in this and maybe just maybe we can turn it into a feature check this out

184
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,560
I Adam I've been listening to the Charlie for about three months or something

00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,400
Although I wish I hadn't a good excuse to message you about my boring life

188
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,880
There's a fellow who

He's got a hot friend who's gonna like sleep with him if he can get five million hits in 30 days

191
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,480

192
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,360
Daily source code those guys will help him out

193
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,280

195
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,320
Help him bust a nut

196
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,640
This is Jordan from Grand Prairie Alberta Canada

197
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,480
Be so I mean sea crest. Oh, oh no

198
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,360
Well, see now this is a true friend

199
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,240
And I'm listening to this and I'm like okay, let me go check out this website

200
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,640
A virgins plea.com by the way. This is what my day consists of here at the cottage, okay?

201
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,560
So you have to have gotten up and have taken Christina to school actually when Christina is is called to the fund of the class and says

202
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,120
You know, well, what is your dad do? What does your father do? What's his vocation? What's his occupation?

203
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,080
And then well, he helps uh virgins 25 year old virgins get laid. Yeah, I need listens to

204
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,680
People talk about that all day and there's big green chair. Yeah, that's my life

205
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
So like I go to this page

206
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,960
Hey guys like you know 25 he's not bad looking he's not hideous. Let's put it that way. He looks clean and and fresh, you know kind of like a

207
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,000
He looks okay and his girlfriend the

208
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:03,360
The girl who promised this wonderful gift the gift of of a first-time love to a man

209
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Is she's hot definitely

210
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:13,440
Definitely and he's already at 2.9 million hits within seven days. So I think he can actually get it made and

211
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,200
Get laid get it made and we should help him out

212
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,400
Yeah, so I went to the site and I'm thinking well, what's the background on this and well luckily enough

213
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,080
He's uh started what he calls audio blogging

214
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,760
So he doesn't quite know that he's really doing a podcast or that we're gonna force him to do a podcast because I need more of these

215
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,640
This is something simply called update one. Let's just listen to a little bit and you hear some of his reasoning and I thought it was pretty touching actually

216
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,280
Hi everyone and welcome to the first audio update from a virgin's plea.com

217
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,040
Okay, now you know take a second to get a custom to the voice

218
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,040
All right, he's a little hyper in the beginning it it drops down about half an octave later on

219
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:58,640
So he's still not an unattractive guy my name is Jeff and I'd like to thank you for taking the time to listen to my

220
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
audio blog

221
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,520
I'm the star of the website of virgin's plea.com and

222
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,360
The whole goal of the website is to get me five million hits in 30 days so I can lose my virginity

223
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,200
But why do I want to lose my virginity so badly you might ask?

224
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,840
Well, the whole story goes back a few years. Well, I don't think that's a hard

225
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,400
That's really not the question is why you're doing it in this man. Oh, that's the question when I was 21

226
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,160
Four years ago to be exact and I was engaged to be married to a woman

227
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,840
I thought I would be with for the rest of my life

228
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,840
Six months before our wedding she decided to cheat on me

229
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Was

230
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,040
Those were just some dark days for me

231
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,400
The shit I went through back then was just nuts

232
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,680
Needless to say I really didn't date much for the last three years after the pain and suffering caused by that

233
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,560
I just couldn't bring myself to date a woman again. Okay, so so he was holding out

234
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,880
For his one true love. He was going to have sex on his wedding night. How beautiful is this?

235
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,440
Old fashion, but okay beautiful

236
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,720
And six months before their wedding day

237
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,280
He finds out she's been cheating on him which is the cheating is one thing

238
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,800
But you know if you were saving yourself a presumably she was saving herself as well

239
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,480
That's quite a blow that so that would freak me out to so for the last three years

240
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,520
I've been single alone and was that any real drive to want to get laid?

241
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,600
Is it coincidence that this is national masturbation month at all you think?

242
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:37,280
Well a very very hot putonic friend of mine said that if I could get a website with five million hits in 30 days

243
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,240
She would have sex with me. Okay, so first of all dude you're in okay you're in no matter what I think in less

244
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
She's a real bitch

245
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,560
She will eventually take pity on you even if you get close. So I'm not worried about it

246
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:56,080
But it's interesting. It's an interesting experiment now it may not be the best way to lose your virginity through an internet bet

247
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:04,000
What do you mean at 25 having never been laid the overwhelming urge to have sex is just starting to get too much to handle

248
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,360
So I decided to do it and so far

249
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,120
I've gotten oh, yeah, we had to wrestle you to the ground for it one million visitors in about seven days

250
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,440
So I'm well on my way to actually making the goal

251
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,120
But I mean it begs some bigger questions, you know, is the internet right to use for things like this?

252
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:28,400
Yes, I don't know. Yes, I mean the support I've seen out there though is just amazing. I think maybe you should do a little prep course in

253
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:35,040
Second life, you know, so you know all your moves and you kind of get some feedback on on your sequences and you're and you vibe

254
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,760
I've gotten hundreds of emails from around the world including some from soldiers in Iraq

255
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,240
People in Australia

256
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,240
You know Romania

257
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,560
Started a my space profile a couple of days ago that got you know 500 friends afar count messages

258
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,840
emails the support from you guys has been amazing. Okay, so I think the daily source code listeners should definitely provide

259
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,400
their resource and their help by hitting this page

260
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,880
Virgins plea.com and

261
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,600
Maybe you know there's more people out there who I think at 25 if you haven't gotten laid by 25 you need some help

262
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:21,520
And I gladly gladly open up this podcast to help anyone because I know that we have

263
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,800
listeners out there of all preferences ages races religions Creed backgrounds upbringing

264
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,360
Who'd be happy to help no hits necessary. I'll just connect you now of course what I am expecting

265
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,400
25 year old virgin I am expecting you to podcast really podcast your experiences

266
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,320
So including your you know the first time. I'm not interested in video

267
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:52,080
Yet he says later in this comment which is really long this video of this audio blog video does

268
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,800
It was like another two minutes left on it. He says that he's going to write up all of his experiences

269
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:02,080
But that's not gonna cut it. No, you've already stepped into our realm into our world into the world of audio

270
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,400
You owe it to science actually science and progress you owe it

271
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,120
To record this in audio and and you and you should let your platonic friend your

272
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,520
Friend formerly known as the platonic friend you should let her know about it lettering on it

273
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:26,000
She's already given up her identity freely so I guess that's okay, but just the audio that will be fantastic and I guarantee you

274
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,520
I guarantee you it's gonna do something. I'm not sure what but it's definitely gonna do something and I really hope you hear this

275
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,360
Because that would be cool and you should podcast

276
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:44,160
Maybe once a week for the next three weeks since you're only into week number one and then wind it up, you know

277
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:49,120
She will I'll give you the bandwidth no problem. We'll put you on the network. It'd be awesome. Completely awesome

278
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,240

279
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,640
Those you still hanging around

292
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,160
Let me see

293
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,360
Gosh, I couldn't have gotten more links over the weekend about the BBC

294
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,000
Hoping to second life that was pretty interesting, huh? I woke up Saturday morning

295
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,840
I said the Patricia said oh man the BBC they're doing exactly what I was thinking of doing

296
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
BBC has staked acclaim to a

297
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:15,600
Virtual tropical island where it can stand on stage online music festivals and throw exclusive celebrity parties

298
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,920
So I listened to the radio one portion of this

299
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,520
They had their big event the the one big weekend event which is held in Dundee

300
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:31,440
So that was on Saturday and it's something the BBC is very good at doing a live concert carrying the live music

301
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,960
Doing the background interviews backstage in the dressing rooms

302
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:42,160
We used to do this stuff in Holland all the time and it did it's incredibly expensive to do this type of radio programming

303
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,160
But so appreciated it's so good and

304
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:51,120
Then in second life they did indeed get themselves an island or what is known in second life is a virtual world by the way

305
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,800
That a lot of the source code listeners have been turned on to and starting to check out and actually meet each other through second life

306
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,400
Maybe it's a whole misnomer, you know, it's just extended chat

307
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,480
It's what it is but it's good because there's there is a physical aspect to it

308
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,440
So what's known as a sim now here's here's where what I don't understand and here's where

309
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,400
Pod Show is going to do something a little different. I love the the whole idea of using it as a collaborative environment to

310
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,120
sample music

311
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,440
or video or any other type of audio of actually

312
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,800
At the Pod Show Palace which is a virtual palace not for real. It's it's just a place where we're gonna be able to get together

313
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,960
I've built a movie theater and it's great, you know, instead of

314
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,640
Being on for instance Skype and saying okay, here's a link everybody open this up and look at it

315
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,120
You can all basically sit down and chairs and

316
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:52,080
Position your view and it plays on the big screen. You see it at the same time. It's it really is a mind trip that kind of stuff for me is very exciting that you so that

317
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,600
But what the BBC did is when you have one there's there are technical limitations actual computer

318
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:06,240
Processing limitations to what you can do in this virtual world and this is a real tinfoil hat moment isn't it

319
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,640
But you can really only have about 50 avatars which are representations of people

320
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:22,080
On one sim at the same time before it really starts to slow down and so I I figured this out a long time ago and when we open up the palace

321
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,800
We'll actually be teleporting you to other sims where we've also purchased

322
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,120
Well, we call it land, but it's basically, you know computer space

323
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,080
to build stuff so that we can have a much larger

324
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:40,800
amount of people having and also people to be able to be able to be have private conversations and stuff like that

325
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,680
And if you don't think it happens it really does forget all the you know the the

326
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:51,600
Castles and the palaces and the clouds and the and and the weather and all these life like things just

327
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,680
What is actually happening is people are getting together. Hey, I don't this is your war from second life

328
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,240
Just sat at table right now on second life and we've just found out each of his locations

329
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,400
And it's just made me realize how great second life is

330
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,440
There's someone from Hawaii two people from Holland and two people from UK

331
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:23,120
It still just shows how great second life is because we like in real life we would probably never meet

332
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,400
And because we like separate it for thousands of miles here we are just

333
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,600
Sitting as a table

334
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,040
Talking like right there like meeting each of it. It's really amazing and

335
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,680
Like to thank the island for introducing many of us to second life

336
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,520
And rather abruptly

337
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
See see what I mean so what what what is it? I mean how how else are you gonna discover people

338
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,000
That's the thing it's it's critical. Just look at chat and we use this all the time you use MSN

339
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,880
But where do you go when you want to find just a particular group of people who are interested in a

340
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,320
Certain subject or topic or just a community?

341
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:14,320
You know, is it that simple is it that easy? I think second life is in the interface that everybody understands

342
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,480
You know, here's my shack here's where I live come here if you want to talk about me and my shack and whatever

343
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,880
I represent and so it's very easy for people to find each other and

344
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,560
Just sit around and chat, you know, and I drop in at least twice a day

345
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,680
I'm not always interested in all the you know, there's a lot of podcast chat which I like

346
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,080
Okay, but just you know stuff about life. I love it, man. Oh

347
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,160
Oh, forgot to tell you yesterday picked up the in-laws

348
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,320
They're gonna be here with Christina while Patricia and I are in on our on our jet setting tour

349
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,280
So the place is kind of busy

350
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,840
We could have more people here. We could have more guests, but not with those two

351
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,560
Just busy

352
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,680
They're off all off and town by the way. They're out shopping on the high street

353
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,160
So I have a little bit of peace and quiet while I'm while I'm doing the show

354
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,760
So anyway, I just thought of a couple people that I met

355
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:18,000
Since I've been using the second the virtual world second life is an interface to listeners and other people who are interested in

356
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,760
Extending the experience of the podcast and and just like the BBC yeah, man

357
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,000
Definitely gonna get some potsafe music artists in there and now the BBC didn't have any

358
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
any avatars of

359
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,800
The artists who were performing

360
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
But we will

361
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,120
I think they'll make it much better on it

362
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,480
Yeah, they had an at Christmas and I'm not laughing at the BBC. I think it's fantastic

363
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,960
They really jumped on this very well and really brought

364
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,440
Second life to the forefront and also

365
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,320
Harvard Law School the Berkman Center

366
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,040
They had a

367
00:30:53,040 --> 00:31:00,240
Conference on was that Sunday as well. Yeah, I think it was on Sunday and they also had a virtual conference center in second life and I just checked it out

368
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:07,200
You know teleported over there sat down and I was watching the video. It was but I could whisper to someone next to me. You you can't do that

369
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,480
It's interesting stuff

370
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:17,040
So the people that I've been I just want to thank a couple of people who've been working really hard on getting this pot show

371
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,760
Palace X I've been doing nothing but just kind of

372
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,320
tutoring around figuring stuff out and and paying for all the work

373
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,120
But my partner in this is Brittany

374
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:33,120
You've probably seen her around the castle. She's really she's doing everything. She's doing all the and I don't know who she is in real life

375
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,920
I don't care she's Brittany and she's doing just a kick-ass job

376
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,880
of coordinating

377
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,880
Getting stuff done

378
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,600
She knows a shitload about second life then there's master Q who she introduced me to now he is

379
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,960
Master Quattro he actually posted a comment on

380
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,680
Charlie 386 he works with the and she chung

381
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,760
You probably heard about her she was in business week so he's kind of my virtual real estate consultant

382
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:10,640
There's ex-dark ex who's who's been building the the palace and the the casino and and allora he works with her magic star doing the

383
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,960
Interior bow-twang working on some pretty interesting scripting stuff

384
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:22,320
Detrol up working on logo and she's a she did the pod show t-shirt. She's working on something for the palace Melissa

385
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,520
And I'm sure I forgot people, but I'm just like wow, you know, there's a lot of people I've met and

386
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,080
You know what it's making a difference we're seeing audience

387
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,320
interaction we're seeing all kinds of I don't know

388
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,280
Just a few than I got

389
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,280
All right, I got them crazy

390
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,960
You say you want to see me run or now you have your wish

391
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,600
You know I will not come over to your castle in second life. It's not because I do not have invitation

392
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,400
It's because

393
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Even your avatar is gorgeous

394
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,960
I cannot stand to look at

395
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
I'm sick of it. I don't cry

396
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,320
I know that if we met that I would feel like a glass and penis on our windy day

397
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,120
Next to your manly good looks

398
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,440
So I've taken on a whole new fitness regimen

399
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,440
I'm running five miles a day in fact. I will no longer be known as comic strip blogger

400
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,560
You can call me comic strip jogger

401
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,120
And with my hair transplant surgery, I will soon have long flowing blonde mane like you're on

402
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,800
And then with my four inch platform heels

403
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,920
When we finally do need that I'm curry. I'll be able to stand face to face. I look you straight

404
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,920
And the eye and tell you

405
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:57,040
When I get out of hospital Adam curry. I would I

406
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:05,360
Oh damn you don't have Adam curry. I got to tell you just on the pod show stuff

407
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,640
We got you know there's so much

408
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,960
Interesting stuff happening. We're starting a running channel

409
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,880
I actually we've been developing one for the past couple of weeks and we and it was we're very quick to

410
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,040
To be secure sponsorship of the channel

411
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,000
You can look for that very soon and it fascinates me every single time it's kind of like

412
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,800
It is a sound seeing tour but it's a very focused sound seeing tour you know and

413
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:36,160
I followed along with Steve runner doing his his marathon podcast and there was a little bit of technology involved there

414
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,400
You know the RFID chip that's attached to your shoe which then triggers off an email message to tell

415
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,520
The world whoever is the recipient you know where that person is what point they just crossed I mean this there's some cool stuff

416
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,320
Not only that

417
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,520
There was oh yeah, oh man

418
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:02,320
So let's see the earthling stuff is coming the emails went out to the podcast network for

419
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,880
Folks who want to participate in that promotion. It's gonna be awesome

420
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,200
And and this is where the audience you guys really get to participate

421
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,520
You can make a jingle or endorsement or you know, let's make advertising better, right? We've all bitched and moaned about

422
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
The Earthling commercial

423
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,880
Well, here's your opportunity and you can win valuable cash prizes in the process

424
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,480
One more thing that pod safe music summer

425
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,800
Well, I'll just call it the showcase. I don't want to confuse anyone with the Nashville gang that's going out there

426
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,080
And we hope to involve them as well, but we've got some excellent excellent stuff coming up

427
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:52,160
Over the summer with a big sponsor getting more pod safe music out there. It's gonna be a great summer. You know that it really is

428
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
Sing along, if you want

429
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,440
Well, along with the BBC using second life for their

430
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,360
Simul cyber cast this was the number two link email to me in the past week and a half

431
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:29,440
Comes from the New Zealand her Harold and it's from the fine New Zealand company that is successfully turned sewage into modern day gold

432
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:37,600
Mollboro based aquaflow bionamic yesterday announced that it produced its first sample of biodiesel fuel from algae in sewage ponds

433
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,520
It's believed to be the world's first commercial production of biodiesel from wild algae outside the laboratory

434
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,240
The company expects to be producing at the rate of at least one million liters of the fuel for each year

435
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:56,320
From blenheim by April today algae derived fuels only been tested on a controlled conditions with specially grown algae crops

436
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,720
Aquaflow's algae however was derived from excess pond discharge. I think that means shit to you and me

437
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,400
From the Mollboro district council sewage treatment works algae takes most chemicals out of sewage, but

438
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,240
Having too many of them taints the water and produces a foul smell. Yeah, it was right. It was shit

439
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,880
So we are so close to pooping in your tank. It's not funny

440
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:26,720
This is just that with the reactor that was developed just recently. I can see these two technologies converging and we may actually be able to make our own fuel to power our

441
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,800
Automobiles and even even our aircraft

442
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,400
Just by cropping in the tank. You got it love it. I had a period in an early story over here

443
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,520
Not shit. You can't hear that. Can you? Let's just do so off

And the main issue of wired magazine page 33. They have a story about a guy

449
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,560
Peter Bethany from New Zealand that actually had his butt liposfection and

450
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:17,680
Is going to convert it to biodiesel to power his speedboat, which he's going to try to take around the world

451
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,320
I'll get to it. I love the show

452
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,760
Now that's what I call a true hero. You know what I mean?

453
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
How much fat can you get out of your butt though?

454
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,080
From the biodiesel industry

455
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:46,480

A four gift

546
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:04,340
Can't go back to the Wednesdays

547
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:11,040
I told you that I wanted to sacrifice my life on the ground.

548
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:28,720
But all those

549
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,680
today went on.

550
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:41,180
Sean Holocoff, whoo, that's a kind of weird chord there. And that wraps up this Charlie for today from Monday.

551
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:46,180
Of course we'll be back tomorrow as I said for a week, exciting stuff going on Thursday.

552
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:50,680
I'm doing an interview with the BBC, so I'll be Thursday morning, right after I drop Christina off.

553
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,680
But before that, Wednesday, hey, Wednesday is going to be cool.

554
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:59,680
I have a, I think a 130 meeting with Ben Fervayan.

555
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,180
And I, that's a Dutch name. I, I presume that he is a Dutcher of Dutch descent.

556
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:10,180
I don't know if he actually speaks Dutch or not. He would have to think so, though, with that first level surname.

557
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:16,180
He is the CEO of British Telecom. We're getting very close to working some self out with these guys.

558
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:21,680
I can't tell you how excited I am because that would mean the pod show UK actually will become a reality.

559
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:27,680
And I'm so happy that we're going to get all our paperwork straightened out in the next week or do in New York.

560
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:35,680
At our curry dot com, dating source code dot com, I will talk to you guys tomorrow.

561
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,680
Bye bye.

562
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,680
Another pod show podcast, stick it in your ear.

563
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:52,680
Get this pod cast and we're great ones like it on the high performance pod cast of Liberty Network from Pod Show and line-light networks.

564
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,680
I love it.
