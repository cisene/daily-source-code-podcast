Delta Sierra Charlie.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Four, two, eight.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Sixty million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I like to think I'm flying into this show.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Fantastic. It's Adam Curry.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Heavenly Liberty Jones.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Works in the shop that she owns.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Lessons to music like swing.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
When there's no customer's in.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Just because she don't like to drive.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Takes the sea I stood fine.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And these are thoughts outside.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
To the river at night.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is the awesome thing.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Why don't you come for me and take me your way.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If you like this.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This is the awesome thing.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I wish you would buy.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We keep the money back to my place.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This is the awesome thing.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why don't you come for me and take me your way.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If you like this.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
She's gotta clean the ride.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And there's a name word in play.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If you lose a lonely desire.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Give it to yourself.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why don't you come for me and take me your way.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If you like this.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Give it to yourself.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Why don't you come for me and take me your way.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
If you like this.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This is the awesome thing.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Why don't you come for me and take me your way.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If you like this.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I wish you would buy.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If you like this.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I wish you would buy.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I wish you would buy.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Or give some joy.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And you come for me and take me your way.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
If you like this.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
How do I know?

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If you like this.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We keep the money back to my place.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:04:05,640
I love this song. I know I played earlier in the week, but I heard it again yesterday on the U.C. radio show.

52
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:22,040
Damn! The shakes, Liberty Jones from the Podsake Museum that we're kicking off the Wednesday, Charlie, coming to you from a overcast, cloudy and foggy northern California right by the Bay San Francisco, from the Curry condo, good morning everybody, how you doing?

53
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:30,240
Or good afternoon, or good evening, or if you know Australia, how's tomorrow doing? Let me know, hey everybody, it is humday, hold on a second.

54
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:38,840
As I said that, we just got a little bit of sun shining through, so I have to put down the shade here. As you know, this is the Baker's Rack Studio.

55
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:47,840
And it's right next to the window, so when there's a little bit of sun shine, then it just reflects right on the screen and I can't see my show notes.

56
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:56,840
Hey, lots of stuff going on. Lots of stuff to talk about. First thing is an update on the Curry Cottage Quest, which the Lady Patricia has been on.

57
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:03,240
You know, it's interesting. I leave and all of a sudden, she's found the house that we need to buy.

58
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:15,240
Or I should say Cottage. It would be the official Cottage since we've only been renting the Cottage that we're in now for the past year and three quarter years, almost two years now.

59
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:25,040
And so we'd identified the place, absolutely phenomenally beautiful. Of course, I've only seen pictures, but even Christina liked it.

60
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:35,840
The price was definitely what we were willing to pay for what we were going to get. And this could be a place for us to settle down for quite a while, I think.

61
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,440
And so Patricia, you know, she called me up. We've been going back and forth over the past couple days.

62
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:50,840
And I said, hey, baby, no problem. Go ahead. I'll make sure that you can use the checkbook and go buy it. That's kind of what it was.

63
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:57,840
And what happened is really something for a little segment we call Yanks versus the British.

64
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,840
Now we're from our sponsor. It's the Yanks versus the British.

65
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:08,840
We'll drive each other crazy, but everybody knows that it's apparent to see.

66
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,840
Let's just like you and me, it's the Yanks and the British.

67
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,840
The Yanks versus the British.

68
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:26,840
Mind the gap. So when you go to buy, we've bought many houses in our lifetime together, bought and sold some houses.

69
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,840
Some very successfully, one not so successfully, but I think we're pretty good at it.

70
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,840
In primarily in the states and in the Netherlands and in Belgium.

71
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,840
And so now we're ready to do it in the UK. And so as I just said, you know, I said, hey, baby, take the checkbook and go buy it.

72
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:52,840
Let's, let's get a house when I come back. I'll see what you've purchased. Well, little did we know this is not how it works in the United Kingdom. Oh, no.

73
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,840
So they have a price listed and Patricia went back for the second viewing.

74
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,840
I talked with my husband. I love it. Who do I make the check out to? Oh, no, no, no, no.

75
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,840
No, this is not how it works.

76
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,840
We're going to have it on view for two weeks, at least.

77
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:17,840
And then, and we, of course, we already have some offers in Patricia said, well, you know, just tell me what will it take to take it off the market.

78
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,840
I don't know. We want to give everybody a fair chance.

79
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,840
Bullshit. What's up with that? Here's how it works.

80
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:35,840
Apparently, they take these so-called offers and then whoever's closest to what they want, I guess the, you know, we just said, hey, you're asking that much.

81
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,840
Okay, we'll pay for that. That's fine. We'll take it off the market for that or tell me what it'll cost.

82
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,840
No, apparently, we go into this sealed envelope bidding process.

83
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:53,840
And to make matters even worse, even if you're in the middle of negotiations, the vendor, as it's not the guy who's still in the house,

84
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,840
but the vendor can then decide to sell it to someone else. It's very, very confusing.

85
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,840
So now Tuesday, I guess the close bids are going to be solicited.

86
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,840
And then I, I guess we have to write down a new number and then hand it in.

87
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,840
It's just really a very weird situation.

88
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,840
I've never witnessed this before in any country at all. It's like, you know, you want to buy the house?

89
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,840
Yeah, I'll buy the house for this price. Okay, you know, usually try to knock it down a little bit, right?

90
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:28,840
Or you say, well, you know, I'll take your gardening equipment and I'll take, you know, some of this stuff, whatever is not included in the sale and so I'll put that in the separate agreement.

91
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:39,840
And then you're good to go. This is confusing. I'm not sure what to do. If anyone has any recommendations on how to continue and, you know, how much more should we bid than the asking price?

92
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,840
This is so weird. So weird. And who knows?

93
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,840
Maybe all these so-called offers are bullshit.

94
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,840
Anyway, yanks versus the brids. We're learning as we go along.

95
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:57,840
Yes, that I talked about interviewing a comic strip blogger and he sent me an email and he said, absolutely, I'm not shy.

96
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,840
You can ask me anything I want. Anything that I would want, I can ask him.

97
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,840
But no online interviews. Only in person.

98
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,840
And I have to give him at least one month's advance notice.

99
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:18,840
And it has to be on a Saturday, but he did say that he would then come to England. So he doesn't live in the UK. I thought he might be living in the UK. I wasn't too sure.

100
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,840
But he's not apparently because he has to fly over.

101
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Maybe I'll just fly to wherever he is.

102
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
But I think I should do this.

103
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:32,840
You know, some folks have even emailed me saying, hey, man, you know, I kind of like the mistake of comic strip blogger. We keep learning more about him every single day.

104
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,840
For instance, yesterday, who knew he spoke Italian and it sounded pretty good to me.

105
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:45,840
So clearly a character on the Charlie we need to learn more about. So once I figured out my calendar, I guess I'll just do it.

106
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,840
I'll just set it up and we'll interview comic strip blogger and find out what this guy is all about.

107
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,840
SQPN presents the secrets of the Caribbean.

108
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,840
How much do you know about TV channels?

109
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Who is Davey Jones and where does he come from?

110
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,840
Who is Davey Jones?

111
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,840
What is the history of a mysterious flying Dutchman?

112
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,840
Simon, rock, rock, rock, rock.

113
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,840
Well, looks the evil and terrifying track.

114
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,840
You don't come to men, yikes.

115
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,840
Why does the black spot mean eternal damnation?

116
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840
Oh, David Jones is your soul.

117
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,840
When do imprisoned souls recover their freedom?

118
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,840
We are cursed men.

119
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,840
Join me on my quest for answers

120
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:41,840
as I explore the depths of the Caribbean waters in search of the hidden treasure of tales and myths behind the adventures of the pirates of the Caribbean.

121
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,840
So to www.sqpn.com and subscribe.

122
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
Oh yeah.

123
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
It's the good father, Roderick.

124
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Hi. What's up you?

125
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Hi.

126
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
Hi.

127
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,840
I say pirate's my game.

128
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
Excellent.

129
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,840
How long we know father Roderick now?

130
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,840
Well over a year, I think.

131
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,840
Man, the his production has just improved by leaps and bounds as fantastic.

132
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,840
And this sounds like a great show.

133
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,840
So I'm going to definitely get that and put it into one of my channels on Pod Show Plus.

134
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
Hey, great news.

135
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:25,840
You know, this year will be the second annual podcast Expo, which is held up in Ontario, California.

136
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,840
And a number of Pod Show podcasts have been nominated for awards this year.

137
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,840
And I just wanted to give you the list.

00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,840

CC Chapman up in the Metro West studios and Boston congratulations.

146
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
That makes me feel really good.

147
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,840
I'm not on any nominations this year.

148
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
Which I'm okay with.

149
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
I don't know.

150
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
I don't know.

151
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
I don't fit into any category.

152
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840
What did I get last year?

153
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,840
I get the best.

154
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,840
I got best produced, which is so funny because first of all,

155
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,840
I figured I would have gotten the lifetime achievement award.

156
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,840
But best produced, I really don't produce much.

157
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,840
You know, I just grab all this shit in the morning while I'm actually taking a shit.

158
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,840
Folder as you know.

159
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,840
And then I line it all up and I just go.

160
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,840
You know, it's it's all live to cast blaster.

161
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,840
Nothing done in post editing.

162
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,840
Or I certainly don't do much leg work on the production.

163
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,840
But it was very nice anyway.

164
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,840
If funny thing about the podcast expo actually it's the portable media expo.

165
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,840
Not quite sure if I'm going to go this year.

166
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,840
When is it September and September and August?

167
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,840
I'm not hearing as much buzz as I did the first time around.

168
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,840
But I got an email.

169
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,840
I'm not going to say from who.

170
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,840
But there was apparently a relatively large swell.

171
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,840
A request for a panel of erotic podcasters.

172
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,840
And they were denied such a panel.

173
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,840
And that's okay because whoever runs the conference and decide whatever they want to do.

174
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:27,840
But what came back was, you know, erotic has no place at our conference.

175
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,840
Dude, this is there's so much erotic going on in podcasting.

176
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
We're finally free.

177
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,840
We can finally talk about all the things we want to talk about.

178
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,840
And now we can't have a panel.

179
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,840
So still not sure if I'm, I don't need an erotic a panel personally.

180
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,840
Not at the expo, but I think I might drop in.

181
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,840
I just want to say hi to some people because it's been a year.

182
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,840
And there's been a lot of stuff going on.

183
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,840
So we're still working on the calendar.

184
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,840
And I don't know.

185
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,840
I still got to see if I can buy this house or not.

186
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,840
Hey Adam, it's Scott Parent from American cliche.

187
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,840
Just wanted to send you a quick message to say thank you to you in the gang over at podshow.

188
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,840
I signed up with with you guys about, I don't know, a couple of months ago mid-May.

189
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,840
And since then since I joined the podshow family, had a couple of great advertising deals.

190
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,840
Now this, the new opportunity, I'll be on serious and a serious rotation starting early August.

191
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,840
And it's been amazing.

192
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:33,840
The podshow delivery network has been awesome, you know, the speed and the reliability is just, it's there.

193
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,840
And now with the release of podshow plus I think you guys are just really onto something and tapping into something

194
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,840
that that's really needed out there in the community.

195
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,840
So you put together great staff, Richard, Matt, Joe.

196
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Those are the people I deal with on a regular basis, but you've got a great team over there.

197
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,840
And I just want to say again, thanks.

198
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,840
It's really worked out well for my show.

199
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,840
For anyone out there that's thinking about taking the leap and joining podshow plus.

200
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,840
And, you know, putting their show up there and creating a page and, you know, just do it.

201
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,840
It's worked out really well for me.

202
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,840
And I just wanted to acknowledge that and say thanks.

203
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
So thanks again, Adam, and I'll talk to you soon.

204
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,840
Take care, man.

205
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
All right, buddy.

206
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,840
And you ain't seen nothing yet because, man, now we're finally we're whipping into into medium mode now.

207
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:18,840
Now that at least we've gotten architecture launched and we've got stuff kind of stabilized and working.

208
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,840
Oh, we were down yesterday for like a good 45 minutes.

209
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,840
That was interesting.

210
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,840
Some really esoteric thing happened.

211
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,840
But it was great because, you know, back in the day Ron and I would usually just go,

212
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
Oh, fuck, would freak out.

213
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,840
We'd be running around trying to figure it out with people.

214
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,840
And yesterday when it happened, we went to launch.

215
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
And we came back.

216
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,840
It was, it was a beautiful, beautiful experience.

217
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,840
But now we're in, really, in full-on medium mode, as I said.

218
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:55,840
And now we're, you know, getting podcasts into different rotations in the spinnets into, you know,

219
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:01,840
the frequency of changing of the flash on the homepage, you know, what's recommended in new channels.

220
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,840
All this stuff, the program guide, it's exciting.

221
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,840
There is a lot of stuff going on.

222
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,840
And it's just continuing throughout the week until I leave on Saturday.

223
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,840
So as I said, you ain't seen nothing yet.

224
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,840
We're just getting started because even though we're hearing a lot of podcasts are saying that

225
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,840
very happy with what they're seeing, this was built for audience.

226
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,840
This is built for listeners and for viewers.

227
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,840
And wait until you see the dashboard.

228
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,840
I mean, yeah, we've got the bubble, bubble players.

229
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,840
What, which is ugly.

230
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,840
And it shows what we're thinking about.

231
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,840
It doesn't quite do everything we, we wanted for our unleashed, but it's rolling, you know.

232
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,840
So also the positive music network integration.

233
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,840
That's just so much to this comment.

234
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,840
I'd love to hear from you, voice mail numbers, plus 201, 625, 6357.

235
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,840
That's the number you want to use for Skype or alternatively.

236
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,840
We have a number in England in London.

237
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,840
And that would be plus four four two zero seven six eight one three seven five three.

238
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,840
If you're dialing from the states and you're not on a on a cell phone.

239
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,840
Say the cell phone, you do the plus and then the one for the country code.

240
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:12,840
Otherwise it would be O one one four four two zero seven six eight one three seven five three.

241
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,840
And people are calling in responding to yesterday show.

242
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,840
Hey Adam, it's Brian from Chicago.

243
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,840
And we're going to win away in the states.

244
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,840
I'd like to tell you about a spam blocking system.

245
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,840
I would send you the link.

246
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,840
But obviously your email is an organ.

247
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:37,840
Go to devoracv-o-r-a-t.com slash blog.

248
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,840
And on the left hand side there is a link that says I get no spam.

249
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,840
Click that.

250
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,840
Use it service.

251
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
You will get no spam.

252
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,840
It's great.

253
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,840
And they'll be able to do everything that you're doing.

254
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,840
If you have their run box crap that you just doesn't seem to be working.

255
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,840
I don't know.

256
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
The folder.

257
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,840
See you later.

258
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,840
Okay.

259
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,840
Thank you, folder.

260
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
Good to know.

261
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,840
Oops.

262
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,840
Sorry about that.

263
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
Whoa.

264
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,840
One two check two.

265
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
Whatever.

266
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
Yeah.

267
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,840
And I think I figured it out.

268
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,840
I think I figured the run box stuff out.

269
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,840
And I think I've got it working now.

270
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,840
But it is true.

271
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,840
John Devorac says that he does not get any spam.

272
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,840
And I was just looking at the stuff coming into run box.

273
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,840
It's unbelievable.

274
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,840
And a part of the, I figured out a big part of the problem.

275
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,840
Since I'm also the postmaster at curie.com, everything that's sent to anything at curie.com

276
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,840
was also coming to me and was being forwarded through the system.

277
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
So it's just going through all these loops.

278
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,840
And literally, if you so, you know, forget about what spam comes to Adam at curie.com

279
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,840
Just the stuff that, that these spammers will, it's a very educational.

280
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,840
They will just spew at a domain name.

281
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
And they try every combination of name.

282
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,840
And, and of course, that was coming through to me.

283
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,840
But then you look at it.

284
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,840
It's five spans per second.

285
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,840
And each of them is at least like, you know, six K in size.

286
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,840
But you know, have you seen that other spam where you get like 10 images

287
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,840
of about 25 K and it looks like a scanned piece of paper or something

288
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,840
or like a scanned shopping list.

289
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,840
You know, these things are, oh, that's about 150 K.

290
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,840
So that's why stuff starts to fill up and, and gets just stupid.

291
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,840
But I will take a look at what John C. Dvorak is talking about with his,

292
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,840
I get no spam because it's so, I think it's almost impossible to spoof everything.

293
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,840
The crap is broken. Email is broken.

294
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,840
And this is something we're going to do with, with our dashboard and in podshow

295
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,840
plus imagine imagine if you could create just a special place where you could feed

296
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
your friends with cool media.

297
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,840
So I'm not talking about, you know, jotting off a message.

298
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,840
Use instant message for that.

299
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,840
Now, this is instant mashing where you'll open up the dashboard or somewhere

300
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,840
in podshow plus if you, if we're in each other's entourage, you know,

301
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,840
if you dig me and I dig you then I can feed you and you'll see a picture of me

302
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:00,840
and if I've dropped a movie or an episode or an entire show onto that,

303
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,840
it's going to be there for you.

304
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,840
Hold on.

305
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,840
I got the phone ringing. Can't deal with that right now.

306
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,840
So, you know, that's the whole idea there is that if you don't want to receive

307
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,840
stuff from me anymore, then you can just say go away.

308
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,840
You know, that's what we don't have with you.

309
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,840
We don't have a way to authenticate.

310
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,840
So say, yeah, you can send me stuff and it's cool.

311
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,840
I want to receive, we can send it back and forth.

312
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,840
And an easy way to break it off.

313
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,840
And when it comes to sharing media, I think we've got that problem linked.

314
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,840
Hey, Adam. This is Doug and Kathleen from Art of Go Go.

315
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,840
I was listening to DSC 424 and was blown away to hear that.

316
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,840
So, brother number one, the hardest working man in show business,

317
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,840
the godfather of soul, Mr. James Brown,

318
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,840
enjoying the pod safe music network.

319
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,840
You can't miss when James Brown arrives to funk up the party.

320
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,840
Hi, Adam. Congratulations to you and the pod show team

321
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,840
on your one-year anniversary of the pod safe music network.

322
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,840
It's also Art of Go Go's, one-year anniversary.

323
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,840
And to celebrate, we asked podcasting brother number one,

324
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,840

Thanks, Jeff. Here it is.

331
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,840
Don't know much about heart, but I know what I like.

332
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,840
It's more than pretty pictures.

333
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,840
Yeah, that's right.

334
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,840
It can be fine. Art of four men's too.

335
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,840
But where can I turn it?

336
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,840
If I don't know what to do.

337
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,840
You don't have this podcast to think.

338
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,840
But I'm not this one, but go go go.

339
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Go go go go go.

340
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Go go go go go.

341
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,340
Oh man.

342
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,840
Jeff Smith's got a whole cottage industry run and doesn't it?

343
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,840
Go, love it.

344
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,840
Go, go.

345
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,440
I just ordered five more things from Jeff.

346
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,080
Check them out at JeffSmith.com, Jeff's spelled G-E-O-F-F.

347
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,080
And you guys are so right.

348
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,440
When the Godfather of Soul, when James Brown shows up

349
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,920
on the pod save music network, you know something right

350
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,920
is happening.

351
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:16,920
And James Brown was nice enough to make a special little thing

352
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,760
for me to share with you Charlie listeners.

353
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,320
I'm so proud of this.

354
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:30,320
Hot save music and music then and you can play on your podcast.

355
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:36,320
Hot save music is kind of music.

356
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,320
You can play on your podcast.

357
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,320
Let a legal momma jump out there.

358
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:48,320
But it means it's the right to there for you to play it on a podcast.

359
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,320
Deep round on a hot save music,

360
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,320
out, never, out, get round.

361
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,320
Hot save music, out, never, out.

362
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,320
Deep round on a hot save.

363
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,320
You didn't, never, out, out.

364
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,320
Deep round, out, once they music, out.

365
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,320
Deep round, lay on the hot save music, out.

366
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
Yeah.

367
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
Yeah.

368
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
Yeah.

369
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
Yeah.

370
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
Yeah.

371
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
Yeah.

372
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
Yeah.

373
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
Yeah.

374
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Yeah.

375
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,320
I should play the first 10 seconds for a couple people in the office yesterday and I said,

376
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
Wow, man.

377
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
That's all cool.

378
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
James Brown did that.

379
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,320
Yeah.

380
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,320
Yeah.

381
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,320
Yeah.

382
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,320
Yeah.

383
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
Yeah.

384
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,320
Yeah.

385
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
I love it.

386
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,320
I must say though.

387
00:23:53,320 --> 00:24:00,320
I had dinner last night with a good friend of mine Greg Lollie who's an independent record promoter here in San Francisco.

388
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:08,320
He does a lot of hip hop R&B stations here on the West Coast and literally will promote records on behalf of the record company.

389
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,320
He lives kind of at the asshole of the industry if you will.

390
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:22,320
And we came up with a plan that is so cool and involves, uh, was it about nine or ten top artists and podcasts,

391
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:28,320
podcasters using podsaic music and the podsaic music network and I just can't tell you about everything right now,

392
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:37,320
but I think we're going to see more big name artists seeing the value of working with podcasters to promote their stuff.

393
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,320
And I think we're going to see that pretty soon.

394
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:46,320
Hey, um, if you listen to us on serious stars one or two PCHs next, we'll be back tomorrow with Thursday's addition from the condo.

395
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,320
And for those of you still here.

396
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,320
Well, of course.

397
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:55,320
I mean, I can't just to make you feel good about thinking you're going to hear some James Brown without bringing up the godfather of a soul.

398
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,320
Yeah.

399
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,320
I can't walk on over to the podsaic music network.

400
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
Good bucket.

401
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,320
James Brown.

402
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
Yeah.

403
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,320
Good bucket.

404
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
Fuck.

405
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
Yeah.

406
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
Yeah.

407
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,320
Yeah.

408
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
Yeah.

409
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,320
Yeah.

410
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,320
Yeah.

411
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,320
Yeah.

Yeah.

414
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,320
Yeah.

415
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,320
Yeah.

416
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,320
Yeah.

417
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,320
Yeah.

418
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
Yeah.

419
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
Yeah.

420
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,320
Yeah.

421
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
Yeah.

422
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,320
Yeah.

423
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,320
Yeah.

424
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,320
Yeah.

425
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320

Yeah.

433
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,320
Yeah.

434
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,320
All right.

435
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
Yeah.

436
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,320
Yeah.

437
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
Yeah.

Yeah.

449
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
Yeah.

450
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,320
I can go now.

451
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,320

But it's the bathroom!

473
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,320
You can't hold it!

474
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,320
But the body can move it!

475
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,320
Come on!

476
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320

Take that!

509
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,320
Good to be you!

510
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,320
Buh!

511
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,320
Oh man!

512
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,320
It's a good song too!

513
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,320
It's not like you put some crap up on the network!

514
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,320
Put a real James Brown original up there!

515
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,320
I love it!

516
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,320
Got bucket!

517
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,320
James Brown!

518
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,320
You'll find a link to...

519
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,320
This pot set music network page in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

520
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,320
By the way, I guess Adam and Curry dot com works again, but I would suggest to keep using

521
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
Adamette podshow.com.

522
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,320
And of course I was talking about going visiting my friend last night Greg Lawley.

523
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,320
Which means I took Trinity out and I hadn't actually seen Trinity since the last

524
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
time it's here when the transmission dropped.

525
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,320
Wow!

526
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,320
First of all, they had parked it back in the garage underneath the condo.

527
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,320
I'm like a P4, you know, away at the bottom.

528
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
And I couldn't believe it.

529
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
They had washed it.

530
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,320
And I have chrome rims.

531
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,320
I didn't even know I had chrome rims.

532
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,320
And it shifts.

533
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,320
Oh man, you can barely feel the shifting.

534
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,320
It really has Bentley Rolls Royce like floating quality now the car.

535
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,320
And they fixed some exhaust thing was busted.

536
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,320
So it doesn't sound as noise as it did.

537
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,320
Actually, it's like a luxurious car again.

538
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,320
It still has the nice loft of McDonald's floating around you.

539
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,320
But hey, it's good for the environment.

540
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,320
Yes, it is.

541
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,320
Hey, Adam Steve Web here with a life spring family podcast.

542
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,320
Man, this war sucks.

543
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,320
And it is a matter of fact, it sucks so bad that I decided that I was going to break

544
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,320
format with a life spring show and talk about it.

545
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,320
I don't normally talk about politics as you probably know.

546
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,320
But with some things that I've heard set on some podcasts recently and with the news coverage

547
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,320
I'm seeing.

548
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:32,320
And then the final factor that made me decide to do this show on the the war was an email

549
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,320
that I got from a listener of mine.

550
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,320
Well, listen to the show and you'll hear the email that he sent me.

551
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
And you'll hear my response to it.

552
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,320
You'll hear my response to the war, the situation there.

553
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,320
And of course, I take it from a biblical perspective and also the human perspective.

554
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,320
I sat down with my brother-in-law, Steve O'Brien, who is the associate pastor at the church

555
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,320
I attend.

556
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,320
He's also a chaplain with the United States Air Force reserves.

557
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,320
And so he has that perspective as well.

558
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,320
And we spent about a half an hour talking about the war.

559
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:05,320
And I'd really encourage you to take a listen to life spring number 98 and see how it fits in

560
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,320
on your perspective of the war.

561
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,320
Yeah, war sucks.

562
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
No doubt about it.

563
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,320
And now on a happier note, I really want to say how much I'm enjoying pod show plus.

564
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,320
When I first started, I had one show, life spring podcast.

565
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,320
But now there's a family of podcasts.

566
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,320
And so you can check it out at podshow.

567
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,320
Go to lifespring.podshow.com.

568
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,320
From there, you can get links to all the other life spring shows.

569
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,320
Oh, and by the way, I'm a scruncher and I stand while I record.

570
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,320
I stand to my friend, but scrunch and sorry, you can't take me down that road.

571
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,320
Yeah, it's funny. I got an email yesterday.

572
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,320
I've been talking about when I went to Iraq in 2004 and did a live radio broadcast.

573
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,320
I've actually received some interest.

574
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,320
I'm not going to say from where, which aren't forces, but I have received some interest

575
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,320
about possibly going over and doing something similar.

576
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,320
Well, let's see, about three war zones, the United States can choose from these days.

577
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,320
But I think that would be quite interesting.

578
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:10,320
Because besides the human aspect of this show that we did from Iraq,

579
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,320
and actually broadcasting live and really connecting troops with their families back home,

580
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,320
I learned a tremendous amount about the country about what was going on.

581
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,320
And so it would be fantastic opportunity.

582
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,320
And I mentioned this to Ron yesterday, and he gave me one of those looks like,

583
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,320
the kind of look he gives me when I tell him that I'm doing something new with flying.

584
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,320
And he said, dude, if you go, I'm going.

585
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,320
So, keep you up to speed on that.

586
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,320
And thank you very much, Steve, for all the nice words you had about Pod Show Plus.

587
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,320
Although, it's not without problems, it is not.

588
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,320
Hi, Adam, just been listening to one of the shows,

589
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,320
and I thought it would give you a quick piece of feedback on signing up for Pod Show.

590
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,320
The one minor annoyance I found was that when I was putting it on my details,

591
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
and it said, I agreed to the terms and conditions.

592
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
I kept on the terms and conditions,

593
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
thinking it would open in another window.

594
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
It opens in the same window.

595
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,320
And then when you go back, it's white based all the details you've put in.

596
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,320
It's not a big problem, but sort of you give a feedback.

597
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,320
So, it's made.

598
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,320
No, it's stupid.

599
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,320
Yeah, it's a totally dumb thing.

600
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,320
That makes sense.

601
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,320
Of course, it should pop up in a separate window, so you can read it.

602
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,320
Dude, so sorry.

603
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,320
Well, the whole crew listens to the daily source code.

604
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,320
It really is a great way to feed back stuff

605
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,320
that we want changed.

606
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,320
When you hear someone saying that,

607
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,320
oh man, it's going to fix it right away.

608
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,320
It doesn't sound like it's a huge problem to fix,

609
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,320
so thank you very much, appreciate it.

610
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,320
But we totally need to fix that.

611
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
If it's still not fixed.

612
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,320
And now, we have the Troy Needs and iPod contest running.

613
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,320
And I thought I was pretty clear,

614
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,320
but people still don't quite seem to have it down.

615
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,320
I'm going to give away a video iPod to the best domain name.

616
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,320
And this all started with Troy Needs and iPod,

617
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,320
and then we had a dot com.

618
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,320
And then we had the next domain name, which was,

619
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,320
by the way, Troy Needs and iPod dot com,

620
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,320
I still find extremely original.

621
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,320
And of course, is a contender and in the running.

622
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,320
Then what do we get?

623
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,320
I need an iPod more than Troy dot com.

624
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
And I said, please put it into one place.

625
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,320
I want you to put it into a comment at daily source code dot com.

626
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,320
And it was like, yeah, I got one at daily source code dot com

627
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,320
and five at curry dot com and still lots of them coming

628
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,320
in through email.

629
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,320
I realized that part of that is because people are behind a few episodes behind

630
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,320
and they're just now catching up.

631
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,320
So, resubmit it, please go to daily source code dot com

632
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,320
and put it into a comment there.

633
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,320
So, I can really track it and have it all in one place.

634
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,320
Hi, Adam.

635
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
This is Tom from the Fox View podcast.

636
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,320
And just leaving you a message here about a new domain name

637
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,320
that I got for your Troy Needs and iPod contest.

638
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,320
So, I had three criteria for picking the name.

639
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,320
One was it had to be something related to the Charlie.

640
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,320
Two, it had to be a name that suits the outcome of the contest.

641
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,320
And three, it had to be a name that is easy to remember

642
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,320
and rolls off at the top of your tongue.

643
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,320
Now, the name I came up with, and you can insert a catbuster

644
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,320
gum roll here, is www dot.

645
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,320
I want an iPod by listening to the Charlie dot com.

646
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,320
Now, if I am outside chance, I don't win the contest.

647
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,320
I figure I can often do the buzz of aim to the winner.

648
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,320
Next change for maybe an iPod.

649
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,320
I don't have any film in it last year, so I can't still offer the main name.

650
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,320
But I can't refer you to my podcast at www dot.com.

651
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,320
Thanks for that, Adam, and talk to you later.

652
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,320
There's always room.

653
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,320
Always room to promote your own podcast, isn't there?

654
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
Call me off guard there, dude.

655
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,320
Of course, castblaster does have the drum roll.

656
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,320
I was just late.

657
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,320
So two things happened this morning as I was going through my email.

658
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,320
CC Chapman sent me a screenshot of, I guess it's at the Rockstar Supernova.

659
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,320
You know, that's the Tommy Lee reality show.

660
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,320
I think it was actually on last night, I caught the tail end of it before I went to bed.

661
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,320
And it was a screenshot of the website, and it shows what Tommy's favorite songs are.

662
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,320
And you guys, I don't know if it's a direct sale or what the store was.

663
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,320
But on the list, he had, I think two or three black lab songs.

664
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,320
I'm like, yeah, I know those guys, you know, I'm known them for quite a while.

665
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,320
They're on the Podsive Music Network.

666
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
So that was the first thing that happened.

667
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,320
Then as I'm going through the voicemails, again, the number is 20165-6357.

668
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,320
This is what shows up.

669
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,320
Hey, Adam, it's Paul Durham from Black Lab.

670
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,320
I'm trying to get a bit of a west coast touring thing going playing some acoustic shows.

671
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,320
I'm in San Francisco, July 28th at the cafe.

672
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,320
I do Nord, and an honor of Fuba Friday, and National Sisters Admin Day.

673
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,320
I will be playing live at Podsio headquarters.

674
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,320
Just to get you warmed up for that night's acoustic set.

675
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,320
I hope you're on the rest of your pod people can make it.

676
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,320
Meanwhile, it's something like rockin' the daily source code.

677
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,320
We hear a black lab.

678
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,320
I've got this single call without you, and I need a bit of the curry cowbell.

679
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,320
Here's hoping you could help me out with that.

680
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,320
All right, man.

681
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,320
How are you?

682
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,320
Thank you so much.

683
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,320
This is great.

684
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:26,320
Fuba Friday is for the 700 people who used to work at Think New Ideas, the company that

685
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,320
Ron and I built in the 90s.

686
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
I know some of them still listen to the show.

687
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,320
We had something called a Think Drink, which is on Friday at 5 o'clock.

688
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,320
That was it.

689
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,320
We shot everything down.

690
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,320
We hung up on clients, and we got together.

691
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,320
We had some food and drink, and just chatted, and played some music, and hung out.

692
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:48,320
We had people within the company present things, or it's just a cultural thing.

693
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,320
We've done, in fact, I've done it in other companies, and Ron did it in other companies

694
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,320
that I wasn't involved in.

695
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,320
Now we have the Fuba Friday.

696
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,320
Of course, Fuba are stands for fucked up beyond all recognition.

697
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:04,320
We have a very large engineering staff.

698
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,320
The rest of everyone who works at HQ loves what they do.

699
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,320
We have to unwind on Fridays.

700
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,320
We have the Fuba Friday.

701
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:20,320
We get some drinks, and we get some food, and see last Friday, Ron and I presented all the stuff

702
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:27,320
that we've been showing to distribution partners, and also advertising agencies in the US,

703
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,320
as well as in the UK.

704
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,320
It involves all aspects of the company.

705
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,320
Everyone gets a shot at presenting what they do to the rest of the company.

706
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,320
It's always done with humor and fun, and it's always alcohol-induced.

707
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,320
I have to admit.

708
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,320
So now it appears, and we've had some bands play before.

709
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:50,320
Black Lab is going to play on Friday, and I hear an invitation there to play calm down.

710
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:56,320
Unfortunately, I didn't bring the curry cowbell.

711
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,320
And Friday, as we rock it out for the weekend, I'll play the new Black Lab.

712
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,320
This is without you, on the Charlie.

713
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,320
Keep up.

714
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,320
It's just we took.

715
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:18,320
Keep the record down the books, but tell me what it was that I'm wrong.

716
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,320
I think about California.

717
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,320
I think about getting out of here.

718
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,320
I think I'll change my name.

719
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,320
I know I'll never be the same.

720
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,320
I know I'll never be the same.

721
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,320
I know I'll never be the same.

722
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,320
I know I'll never be the same.

723
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,320
I know I'll never be the same.

724
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,320
I know I'll never be the same.

725
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,320
I know I'll never be the same.

726
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,320
I know I'll never be the same.

727
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,320
I know I'll never be the same.

728
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,320
I know I'll never be the same.

729
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,320
I know I'll never be the same.

730
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,320
I know I'll never be the same.

731
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,320
I know I'll never be the same.

732
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,320
I know I'll never be the same.

733
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,320
I know you're sick of me now.

734
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,320
I know you're sick of my eyes.

735
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,320
I never learn to keep it to myself.

736
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,320
I think about California.

737
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,320
I think about burning down this town.

738
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,320
I think I'll change my name.

739
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,320
Maybe you should do the same.

740
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:32,320
If I were you, if I were you

741
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,320
No matter where I go

742
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:40,320
What I do I always feel with you

743
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:46,320
If I were you, if I were you

744
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,320
Tell me what I do

745
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,320
What I say, I'll cut out

746
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,320
And I'm this way without you

747
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,320
Is that you?

748
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:07,320
Is that you?

749
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,320
Is that you?

750
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,320
I'm just this one's

751
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:19,320
Tell me forget that I was drunk

752
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:23,320
That night when I said

753
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,320
Said that I would jump

754
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,320
I'm out to my death

755
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,320
You should ever be

756
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:37,320
You promised that you'd always be with me

757
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,320
Are you black eyes to live

758
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,320
Cause I just can't live without you

759
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,320
Without you

760
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,320
No matter where I go

761
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,320
What I do I always feel

762
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,320
But I'm with you without you

763
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,320
Without you

764
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,320
I'm with you

765
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:10,320
I'm just this one's

766
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,320
Tell me what I do

767
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,320
What I do

768
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:21,320
I'm just this one's

769
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,320
Tell me what I do

770
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,320
What I do

771
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,320
I'm with you

772
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:52,200
I said Friday we'll bring you the new black lab that was without you winding up the Wednesday

773
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:57,560
edition of the Daily Source Code, DailySourceCode.com is where you can find the latest

774
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:04,120

776
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,520

778
