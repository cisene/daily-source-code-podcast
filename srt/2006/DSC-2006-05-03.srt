And now he lives in the place called Jerry.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Can they give any other one?

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
About $60 million worth of airplanes trapped in my ass.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You've got no comment.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Got you found out with your man.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You've got no go down.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You've got to give it all out your care.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I am not a winner.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I am not an ass.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I love it, man.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But you keep trying to put my love to the tears.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You're not the one in the world.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You're not the one in the world.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You're not too bad, man.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You're not the one in the world.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You're not the one in the world.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're not the one in the world.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, if you're on a naked, you're mad to give it all out your care.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm gonna tell you why.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But you can't take it.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
There's always someone else who you care.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I ain't trying, don't put your trust to the taste

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Just keep on going and you're about to have the taste

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah, but all the money in the world

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Just don't know how what I will do

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But I've had only made a deal

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
All the money in the world

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Those up there have to know

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
All there have got to do is it

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
All the money in the world

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
All the money in the world

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:21,000
All the money in the world

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All the money in the world

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
All the money in the world

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
All the money in the world

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
All the money in the world

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Don't know how what I will do

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But I've had only made a deal

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
All the money in the world

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Still I've had to know

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
All the money in the world

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
All the money in the world

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
All the money in the world

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
All the money in the world

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
All the money in the world

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hey everybody, welcome to the Charlie

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This is going to be a fun show

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
See how many times you laugh at all this shit I say

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
On the show today, Lady Patricia

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Let's drop by

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Hello

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This is not just because we love each other very much

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And we like doing stuff together

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But it's all about ratings

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh is that so cute?

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I don't like that

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Well that's not honest

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What do you mean is the most honest thing I can say

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
People love it when you're on the show

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
They all love it

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I just do it because sometimes I like to talk to you

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
No it's okay

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, Patricia was complaining about the sound

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's right

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I gave Christina my headphones

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yep

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So that's how they got busted

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And I like it

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So anyway, due to popular demand

91
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm trying to get Patricia on the show

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Nice underwear on

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Shut up

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is not it is nice

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Adam is in his underwear

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Adam is in his underwear

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Adam is in his underwear

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Not in my underwear

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Oh yeah

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
At my black for say slacks on

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
These are my for say

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And my Russell and Brumley

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Crumley shoes

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yep

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And this is this you gave me this is my Italian wife beater

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That's what they call this like a wife

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Oh is this

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah, except my other ones are really wife beater

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I said are you going to beg the bread?

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yes

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm making a pasta for you baby

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Come here

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll make your pasta rise

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We had a lot of things we wanted to talk about

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Hmm

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Today on the show

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And I figured I'd start it off

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Because we got some feedback specifically for you

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
About

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Maybe we're talking about the Beatles

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah, it was the Beatles

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, yeah

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Because Frank Sinatra is in a playroom

128
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Is he in a playroom

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Is Frank Sinatra in a playroom

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Is he actually in it?

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And he's not in it, is he?

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No, he's not in it, at all

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't even think

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He has any talent

135
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Now he's a conductor

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
He is

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah, I'm sorry, he got to be pretty talented

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He worked with his dad

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Watch, I'm waving my stick

141
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah, he worked with his dad

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And I think he does arrangements or something

143
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But I don't think that this is the way he reacted

145
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
On TV

146
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I think it's not his production

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's got to deal with his sister

148
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Oh

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Little bit of nastiness

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yeah, so that's maybe

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And they invited him to see the show

152
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And that's why he said

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I was amazed

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And he was actually thinking

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I was going to play

156
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Because I see my dad

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So that's not important

158
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But the way he reacted

159
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Mmm

160
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Mmm

161
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Mmm

162
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Are you a bit jealous?

163
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
A bit jealous of the success of your sister

164
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

165
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He had a very grumpy face

166
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm just going to close the door for one second

168
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Because our next door neighbor

169
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Better known as our daughter

170
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Oh, do you?

171
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He said not my radio may be

172
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I don't know that she has it on the shower

173
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Oh, okay

174
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He has that shower radio

175
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So now

176
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So now, you know what you were saying

177
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It wouldn't be great

178
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If there would be

179
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Something similar with the Beatles

180
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah

181
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And check this out

182
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Listen to what I've got here for a second

183
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hi Adam

184
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This is Bat

185
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Also known as a French lazy Bastard

186
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
This is a new guy

187
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I love this

188
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I was talking about the French being lazy

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Bastards

190
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That one of the works that I'm going to protest

191
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I love this guy

192
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Keep sending stuff

193
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's the French lazy Bastard

194
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But I'm going to play that again

195
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I love it

196
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay, but listen, he'll be

197
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He'll be standing in more stuff

198
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm sure you'll hear what

199
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I had done

200
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This is Bat

201
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Also known as a French lazy Bastard

202
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I can't really talk to you right now

203
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Because I signed a contract with Syracuseolise

204
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh, you're before

205
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So

206
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm not able to

207
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Tell you that I'm one of the characters

208
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
They're a new show called The Love

209
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm going to take place in Vegas

210
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Really soon

211
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But I can tell you that you will be always welcome

212
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And also all the listeners and podcasts

213
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
To come here

214
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's always a pleasure to visit

215
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Especially in Vegas

216
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Really strange city

217
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So I hope I will see you soon

218
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And by the way, I will stop my podcast

219
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Ready soon too

220
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
At FrenchFamilyat.com

221
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And you can be sure that no beaters music

222
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's going to be played on my podcast

223
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
See you soon

224
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Bye

225
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I think you should call it

226
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The French lazy Bastard podcast

227
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That'll be quite much more commercial name

228
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So he's a player

229
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
In this production

230
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Called Love

231
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Which is exactly what you want

232
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And it's going to be in Vegas

233
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And it's about to beat him

234
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah, here's the details

235
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That was not very clear

236
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
When he was saying

237
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Well, he was saying he because he's under contract

238
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
He can't talk to you about it

239
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's a bit early

240
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But well Paul Barry Jr. sent a Gmail to me

241
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The show is called Love

242
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Here it is

243
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Preview performances June 2nd through June 29

244
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
7 p.m

245
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh, we have to go

246
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Dude, totally

247
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
During performances

248
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The creative team is in the very final stages of production

249
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The audience has reaction and participation

250
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's an important step in this process

251
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The artistic director of Love

252
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Reserves the right to interrupt their performance

253
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
To make any adjustments

254
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Very blah, blah, blah

255
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He's even given me a ticket line to call

256
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Wow

257
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm thinking what we do is

258
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We asked the French lazy Bastard

259
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
If he can hook us up

260
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Oh, what did he just say?

261
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
He says something

262
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm sorry, let me just see what

263
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Only you

264
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
For me

265
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Bye

266
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Bye

267
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Bye

268
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The chemo

269
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Watanabe

270
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
From the potsafe

271
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Music network

272
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Okay

273
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Club for the song

274
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Very good

275
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I say, why don't we ask him to hook us up

276
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yeah

277
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We're not going to sing Elp

278
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Elp

279
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Elp

280
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I need somebody

281
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Elp

282
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't know if he's singing

283
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Hello

284
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I am the French lazy Bastard

285
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Elp

286
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
No

287
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But yeah, I feel very close to the Beatles

288
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Songs and the Beatles

289
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Time area

290
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Because

291
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You know, it was my time

292
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
When you were growing up, absolutely

293
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
My time I was there

294
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yeah

295
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah, I was there

296
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You were there during the original

297
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Love End

298
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah, the Love End

299
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That we did

300
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That was a world

301
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It was not a worldwide telegraph

302
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It was the first satellite broadcast

303
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah

304
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And the stones were there

305
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It was 69

306
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
68

307
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm going to guess

308
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I could be

309
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Could have been

310
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
68

311
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah

312
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And so it was done at the BBC studios

313
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That was where the main location was

314
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The Stones

315
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
No, the Beatles were there with the Stones

316
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Stones and a couple other

317
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I think a Marion Faithful

318
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And all those...

319
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Marion Faithful?

320
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Faithful

321
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I said it right

322
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah, you did

323
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I know

324
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The Dutch have a travel

325
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You don't haunt, by the way

326
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You're not really Dutch anymore

327
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The Dutch have a problem

328
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
We're pronouncing this

329
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah

330
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So the safe face

331
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And we literally heard a guy on a TV show

332
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah, Marion Faithful

333
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm more like

334
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But she had her face full

335
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Help me, help me

336
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That time she had her face full

337
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh yeah

338
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Oh yeah

339
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But so yeah

340
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
All around Europe

341
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And I think I don't know if in America

342
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
No, I think it was Europe

343
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Probably European thing

344
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And you were in the Dutch studio

345
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah, it was in the US

346
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And in the US

347
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It wasn't that the studio that I used to record my show in

348
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Or was it a different one

349
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You were in the recording

350
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah, could have been concordia

351
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yeah, it was only two

352
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So we had the stars from Holland there

353
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Which is you

354
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And the Femco to was there

355
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The man behind the Golden

356
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Golden Earing

357
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And Venus

358
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And Chuck and Blue was a little bit later

359
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
No no no

360
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Willem was the man behind the show

361
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Oh that's what you mean

362
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Okay

363
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Chuck was the Golden Earing

364
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Hearing motions

365
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Q 65

366
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Qb and the Blizzard

367
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Probably

368
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Qb are stars

369
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I think about it in the crowd

370
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Uh-huh

371
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Who was our Bob Dylan

372
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah, a couple

373
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And maybe Bozura

374
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Bozura

375
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Bozura

376
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
No, I don't know

377
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Well she wasn't being

378
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Never heard that name ever before

379
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So the Dutch

380
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Marin faithful

381
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Oh

382
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Okay

383
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But and she was

384
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
She was produced by the Golden Earing

385
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
She was very beautiful

386
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Very beautiful

387
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Beautiful girl

388
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Um

389
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So we were also

390
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So you all sat around

391
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Set around with flowers

392
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Love love

393
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
To do

394
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Love love love

395
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So we were sitting

396
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It was amazing

397
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yeah, yeah

398
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah, yeah

399
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
There were a couple of

400
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Um

401
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Uh

402
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Tv's

403
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
A hanging around

404
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Isn't we could see the other people sitting in there

405
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Okay

406
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And they said

407
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Hello Holland

408
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
How are you?

409
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Can you all wait

410
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Are you all there?

411
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Here we go

412
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Holland

413
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yeah

414
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't know if they have a

415
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Still footage of that

416
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Oh yeah, of course they do

417
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I've seen lots of times the black

418
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And white footage

419
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah

420
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I want to see myself

421
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
See that

422
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
There's so much that you and I

423
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And when it comes to footage

424
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And photographs

425
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And recordings

426
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We don't have any of that

427
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Shit

428
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh by the way

429
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I told you I got this guy who has your entire

430
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Every single song you ever released

431
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That's why I wanted that daddy

432
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
CD from you

433
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yeah

434
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Because I'm sending that off to him

435
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah

436
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That's the only thing I know

437
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm sending it off to him

438
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Notice my grammar was correct

439
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I am

440
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm in the process

441
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Look

442
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yeah, it's on the stack

443
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's on the outstack

444
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Because that was the only one

445
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Didn't have because that was never

446
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
sold in stores

447
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It was only available with the

448
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Approaches

449
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That through your

450
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Lepy cosmetics

451
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah

452
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So I said no problem

453
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
There's four tracks on

454
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'll send it to you

455
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But would you be so kind

456
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
As to send us every single

457
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Collective

458
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Collective

459
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Collective

460
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Collective

461
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Would you be so kind as to send

462
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Every single song

463
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Patricia has ever done

464
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And he claims to have them all

465
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
He sent me a list

466
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'll have to give you the list

467
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Every single one

468
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Including all the heart stuff

469
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You name it and he'll send it to us

470
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah, there's a bunch coming out

471
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
For people who want them

472
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah

473
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But this will really be everything

474
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yeah, I mean so there's

475
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's what EMI

476
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Oh, no

477
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
But I think they have everything

478
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It EMI

479
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
No, of course they don't

480
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
No, no

481
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
No, no

482
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Half of it is a red bullet

483
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Some of it's at

484
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's around

485
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Oh, they didn't use

486
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
They don't own it

487
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
No, they don't own it

488
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
They're not going to use

489
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What they don't own

490
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That's that's what's so fucked up

491
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
About the music industry

492
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Is they bring out a box of your stuff

493
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But it's only stuff they own

494
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So it's none of the other stuff

495
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So it sounds from some other

496
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I checked it on really

497
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And I...

498
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yeah, somebody has to do it

499
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I look at that stuff

500
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah, yeah

501
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Especially because they just do it

502
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Without even involving you

503
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Which is fucked up

504
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It amazed me when I saw

505
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The

506
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The amount

507
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Well, how much is going to cost?

508
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
No, how many

509
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
How many

510
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Singles I had

511
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh, dude

512
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
40

513
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Singles

514
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yeah, back when Singles meant something

515
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
EMI

516
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So I don't know the rest

517
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's not even the stars

518
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
This isn't all that shit

519
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So 40

520
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And EMI

521
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah

522
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
In 10 years

523
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah

524
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
10 or 12 years

525
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yep

526
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
That I was singing for EMI

527
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's amazing

528
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So we're doing something fun tonight

529
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
At, I think it's seven o'clock

530
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I hope we don't know that

531
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I hope we don't know that

532
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
We were watching Joan Collins

533
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
On Jonathan Ross

534
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Two, three weeks ago

535
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yeah

536
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And you like Joan Collins

537
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I like her

538
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
She's a feisty lady

539
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah

540
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And how old is she now?

541
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
She's got to be pushed in seven days

542
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
She's got to be very close

543
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
She's got to be very close

544
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
She's already seven

545
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
She's already seven

546
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
She looks amazing

547
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And you know, you can say anything about her

548
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But she's well-preserved

549
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
She's well-preserved

550
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
She's well-preserved

551
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Whatever she does, she looks good

552
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
She's

553
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And she's...

554
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But that's going to...

555
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I think, even though there's

556
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Something very sexy about her

557
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yes

558
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I really, really, really

559
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm curious

560
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What

561
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The rest of her looks like

562
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Why?

563
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Because I just want to know

564
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I mean, would it be like a

565
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What her head stick out like a sore thumb

566
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
About the rest?

567
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I think no, no, I think she takes care of her

568
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
First skin is not bad

569
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
She's still with that guy

570
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Didn't she have some younger guys?

571
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yes, she has a younger guy

572
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And those guys, those guys will keep you moving

573
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But keep you going

574
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
She said that she's very happy with him

575
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
She tried it a couple of times

576
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I mean, with her

577
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
She's been interested, she's been married

578
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
She's been married to some interesting guys

579
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yeah, but didn't work out

580
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But she's a strong woman

581
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Did it come on?

582
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
There was some famous guy she was married to

583
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Wasn't there?

584
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
No?

585
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
No?

586
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I thought so

587
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And some waxed out guy

588
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That didn't work out at all

589
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Peter or something

590
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yeah, yeah

591
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
He turned out to be some kind of

592
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Of course, of course

593
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yeah, you know what's going to

594
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Show up at her doorstep

595
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So she's doing a tour

596
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
A small theatre tour

597
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah

598
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And evening

599
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And evening with Joan

600
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Call us

601
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And I can't, you know, and so

602
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
We're lying on this

603
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And now we're looking at the

604
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
John and we're saying, what is she going to do?

605
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah, and I grab a blackberry

606
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm like, yeah, let's order some tickets

607
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah, so we were very curious

608
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What an evening with Joan Collins

609
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yeah, it's about 35 miles away

610
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's not in London

611
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
She's not in London at all

612
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's a nice, nice trip

613
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I hope so

614
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah, so it's to the south of here

615
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So it's about

616
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Why are you doing that?

617
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Why?

618
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Well, we don't have to go

619
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You know, if you don't want to go

620
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
We don't have to go

621
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Why not?

622
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Just, you know, to do a lesson

623
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
See, yeah

624
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yeah, I thought it'd be interesting

625
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
How my future will be

626
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Oh, please

627
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
This is your future

628
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Right here on this show

629
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
This is your future

630
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
This is your future

631
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
This is your future in show business

632
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
When Jonathan asked her

633
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You know, why she did this

634
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
She said, well, I need the money

635
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Mm-hmm

636
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
That's what I always say

637
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I need the money

638
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That's what I always say

639
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
People think that

640
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I can always use more money

641
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
People always equate celebrity status

642
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
To wealth

643
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Don't have to do anything anymore

644
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Ah, it's so not true

645
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Look at us

646
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You know, because she wanted to show

647
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
She was all that

648
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You want to live like a star

649
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
If you want

650
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Once you are a star like she is

651
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
People expect her to live in a beautiful house

652
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
She can not just live in a little

653
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
College, it's like we do

654
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Of course she could

655
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Of course she could

656
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Of course she could

657
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Of course she could

658
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Of course she could

659
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Of course she could

660
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Of course she could

661
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
No, people expect her to live in a mansion

662
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And she lives

663
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
She has a beautiful man

664
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I got to tell you, I am so beyond that

665
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
For myself

666
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Oh yeah

667
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And why are you building

668
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,800
Castles in second life?

669
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,280
Why a castle?

670
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,440
Well, why just because I like what a castle looks like.

671
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,800
Why not a bunker?

672
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,920
For exactly the way you just said a bunker.

673
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,560
And besides, curry bunker

674
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,440
does not have the same cachet as curry castle.

675
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,560
So what I mean is, everybody would like to have their own castle.

676
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,280
Let me just say, well, we've had a castle

677
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,040
and I miss it still very much.

678
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,880
Yeah.

679
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,760
That's part of it.

680
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,080
Because the castle I'm building in second life

681
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,040
is a great place for entertaining.

682
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,400
Oh, OK.

683
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Uh-huh.

684
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
Yeah.

685
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
OK.

686
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
You want to get into second life now?

687
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
You want to talk about that?

688
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Although, you know, I see that it's very, very interesting.

689
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
And it's brilliant.

690
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,400
And I see it as a game.

691
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,400
But I don't see the purpose of it.

692
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,400
You don't see the purpose of it?

693
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,400
No.

694
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,400
I mean, people can hardly deal with the first life.

695
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,400
And now they're escaped to, they want to escape to second life.

696
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,400
And then, and then probably somebody that they're not.

697
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:03,400
And then, probably be a girl a chick with big boobs and a very extremely eye-eels.

698
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
Have you seen me in second life?

699
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
Are you the girl with big boobs?

700
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
No.

701
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
No.

702
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
And I've seen you.

703
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
So everybody's good.

704
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
Of course.

705
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Somebody that they actually are not.

706
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,400
Well, you, you can.

707
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Is that the fantasy?

708
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Well, the first of all, let's just step back.

709
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,400
See, I am the girl with big boobs and the extremely eye-eels.

710
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Yes.

711
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Exactly.

712
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,400
And all the girls in all the girls in second life who look anything like you.

713
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
I immediately have a crush on.

714
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
The only thing is they're about six feet tall.

715
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
That's the only difference.

716
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,400
And if you were in second life, if you were in second life,

717
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,400
the only thing you change about yourself is you make yourself taller.

718
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
Right.

719
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
True or not?

720
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
Yeah.

721
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
Okay.

722
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Now, let me just step back for a second.

723
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Because I said this to you last night.

724
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,400
You said, who has, in fact, you did want a real Patricia.

725
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,400
What time for this?

726
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
You're really.

727
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
And I said, this is.

728
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
People have hardly time for each other.

729
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
No.

730
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
No.

731
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
Before you get into that, let me just step back.

732
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
It's replacing television time.

733
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,400
It's replacing all that other time that is spent on other entertainment.

734
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,400
I don't think that it's in addition.

735
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,400
So we spend time fun of the TV.

736
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:19,400
If we watch television together, you know that we always, you know, or argue about it.

737
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Or usually about, had you made comments during the commercials?

738
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
Have you?

739
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
Yeah.

740
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Or, you know, a discussion.

741
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
Or you talk about it.

742
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Or you enjoy it together.

743
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,400
You know, with me, you do something together.

744
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
Together.

745
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Right.

746
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,400
But that's what second life.

747
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
You have lots of people do second life together.

748
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Koso and Joe.

749
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,400
So I need to sit there with my laptop and play with you together in second life.

750
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
Well, you don't have to.

751
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Well, first of all, I'm allowed to have some personal time to do whatever the hell

752
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
I want to do.

753
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
Right.

754
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
You know, like you don't do that.

755
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Well, I take advantage of that privilege.

756
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,400
And this actually is, if anything, this is cutting into my flying time.

757
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,400
I might have decided to fly instead of sit on second life for two hours.

758
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,400
So, but it's a choice.

759
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,400
And that's what I think is so interesting.

760
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,400
Why are people choosing this?

761
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Don't give me that's, that's smart.

762
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,400
You think I'm talking out of my eyes?

763
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
I'm not.

764
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
I'm serious about it.

765
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
I'm serious about it.

766
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
I'm serious.

767
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
I'm serious.

768
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,400
But here's what I think is fascinating about it.

769
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,400
And then you can say whatever you want.

770
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
And I really want to hear it.

771
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
I want to hear it.

772
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
I'm interested in it.

773
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
What are you interested in?

774
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,400
No, but here's what I find fascinating.

775
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,400
Is the crossover between real life and second life.

776
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,400
So, first of all, I had no idea what I'm sorry.

777
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
My phone is.

778
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
I don't know.

779
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,400
I thought I heard a big bumblebee or something.

780
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
That was money.

781
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Your ass.

782
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Okay.

783
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,400
I had no idea what would happen.

784
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,400
Because basically, anyone who's in second life has a different name.

785
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,400
And you don't usually know them.

786
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,400
So, I said, I gave up my second life name,

787
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,400
which is about the darkest name I could find.

788
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Adam Newman.

789
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Yeah.

790
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Why?

791
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Well, you can't choose your last name.

792
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
You can only choose your first name.

793
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Okay.

794
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
For some reason.

795
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
And I said that on the show.

796
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
And then people started showing up.

797
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
And last night with the night before,

798
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,400
50 people partying on the roof of the castle.

799
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
But you know, people want to play with you.

800
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
No, it's not about that.

801
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,400
I totally disagree.

802
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
No, it isn't.

803
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,400
I mean, first of all, if you watch and you could see it,

804
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
then you'd see that it's not true.

805
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
People want to chat.

806
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
They want to talk.

807
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
They have questions.

808
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
They want to meet other people who they've heard of.

809
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Maybe on the show.

810
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
It's a sort of playing.

811
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Okay.

812
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
But it just makes it sound so infantile when you say playing.

813
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
It's not.

814
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
It's socializing.

815
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
It's a game.

816
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
It's not a game.

817
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
This is my point.

818
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
There is no game over.

819
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
The game never starts.

820
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
It never ends.

821
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,400
You know, the definition of a game is not what second life is.

822
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
It's it's more a virtual.

823
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
It's.

824
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
Look, people are on MSN all day.

825
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Look at your daughter.

826
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
Yeah.

827
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
All day.

828
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
She's on MSN.

829
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
It is exactly the same thing.

830
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
She only instead of having to come in every time.

831
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
And I say to her, who are you talking to?

832
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Her body.

833
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
Why are you talking to these people?

834
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Well, why not.

835
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Isn't that.

836
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,400
It's not.

837
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,400
It's not.

838
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
It's not.

839
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
It's not.

840
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,400
They open the door and there's somebody who is selling something.

841
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Oh, come in.

842
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
I want to talk to you.

843
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
No.

844
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
No.

845
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
No.

846
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
No.

847
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Because you can.

848
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
First of all, who said they're not selling you anything?

849
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
No.

850
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
No.

851
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
No.

852
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
They're not selling.

853
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
But it's the same thing that somebody comes to my door.

854
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
I just got to go.

855
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Hello, Ms. Curry.

856
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
I just want to talk to you.

857
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Hold on one second.

858
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
Okay.

859
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,400
Folks listening to us on serious satellite.

860
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,400
One, two.

861
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
I'm sorry.

862
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
You're going to have to download the rest of the show.

863
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,400
Go.com to get to everything that we're going to talk about.

864
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,400
PCH is next.

865
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,400
Why would I like to speak to strange people?

866
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
It's not straight.

867
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
It's not strange people.

868
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,400
I hardly time for my own fan.

869
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
Hear me out.

870
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
Hear me out.

871
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,400
So I talked to, and you know, you've heard of Andrew Grommett, Andrew Grommett, who

872
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,400
I've worked with on podcasting for two years.

873
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400
And he now works in San Francisco.

874
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
We talk in second life.

875
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,400
We're talking in second life.

876
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Why don't you just talk to him on the phone?

877
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Because no one talks on the phone anymore.

878
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
If you can avoid it.

879
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,400
It's instant message.

880
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,400
It's just like MSN.

881
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Only instead of having all these different windows open.

882
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
You're in a place.

883
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
Now listen.

884
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Yeah.

885
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
Listen.

886
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
What I'm trying to say.

887
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
So normally we'll be on on Skype.

888
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
It has instant message.

889
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Yeah.

890
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
So we'll be Skypeing back and forth.

891
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,400
And it's just it's so that it's so you don't have to have a full conversation.

892
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Like hi.

893
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
It's Adam.

894
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
I'm calling you to talk about this.

895
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
I'm interrupting.

896
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,400
He can do 15 different things while in some messaging.

897
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,400
And I can do.

898
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
I can have 15 different conversations.

899
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,400
It's multitasking.

900
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
This is what people do now.

901
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
That is a huge shift.

902
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,400
Is it a different way of phoning each other?

903
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
You don't phoning each other.

904
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
It's just not.

905
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
No.

906
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
I mean, it is a different way of.

907
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
It's communicating.

908
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
And so, so communicating is what it is.

909
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
But it's socializing.

910
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,400
And the socializing part is where Andrew would be in second life.

911
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
And then he turned around.

912
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
You say, oh, by the way, Adam, this is Scott.

913
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
Scott is from, you know, so and so.

914
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Party line.

915
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,400
You're equating it.

916
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
You're equating it to old metaphor.

917
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
I'm teasing you.

918
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
I'm not fair.

919
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,400
This is for people like me who don't get it.

920
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
Okay.

921
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
I do.

922
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
See, I, of course, I try to understand it.

923
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,400
And I try to, you know, I wonder if Ron understands it.

924
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
I get into it.

925
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
But there are people just like me.

926
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
Same age.

927
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
They think, why?

928
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
What are we doing?

929
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,400
We have, you know what I mean is we have hardly time for you.

930
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,400
You've hardly time for your family for your loved ones.

931
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,400
You forget to call your mom or I don't know why.

932
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
I called my mom.

933
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
Yeah, you did.

934
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
I spent time with you.

935
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
You know what I mean?

936
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
I'm going to go into joke columns with you.

937
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,400
People spend a lot of time being in this second life.

938
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,400
While they don't even, you know.

939
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
Well, you don't know that.

940
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,400
I'm sorry.

941
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
You just don't know that.

942
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
You don't know other people's lives.

943
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Why?

944
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
You're presuming that.

945
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
You're totally presuming that.

946
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Here's how I look at it.

947
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,400
Now what I want to say is because I'm a bit slow.

948
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
No, no.

949
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,400
It's okay, baby.

950
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:14,400
They can even resolve their problems in real life.

951
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,400
Now they have a second life.

952
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,400
Okay.

953
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
All right.

954
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,400
So let me, let me just,

955
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
I'll, here are the things that I find interesting.

956
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,400
First of all, the fact that when you're,

957
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,400
when we're on the roof of Curry Castle in second life,

958
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
and there's people who I know,

959
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
I don't know them personally,

960
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,400
but, you know, they're in Chicago,

961
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
they're in San Francisco, they're in Tokyo,

962
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,400
you know, all these places.

963
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,400
And here's a way to, to get together

964
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
that is not just a bunch of text command line

965
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
based stuff.

966
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,400
And we have general, you know,

967
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,400
we have interests.

968
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
We should, in some cases, podcasts,

969
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,400
you know, the pieces, music.

970
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,400
So it's life enriching to get together

971
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
and talk about stuff.

972
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Now the problem, of course,

973
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,400
is that Curry Castle was kind of set up,

974
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,400
not to be a party place,

975
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
and, you know,

976
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
and everyone who's coming in

977
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
is kind of new and testing shit out.

978
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
So, you know, one day,

979
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
the things on fire,

980
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,400
the next day, there's, you know, like,

981
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,400
well, and by the way,

982
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,400
the nicest person,

983
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,400
the most respectful in second life,

984
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
comic strip blogger,

985
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
will not come over to the castle

986
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
without an invitation,

987
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,400
even though he has a lighthouse right next door,

988
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
because he feels that's not proper.

989
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,400
I'm telling you, this,

990
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,400
I gotta, I gotta get,

991
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,400
I gotta get the lazy French fucker on too.

992
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
Alright, so,

993
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
um,

994
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
but then Dawn and Drew show up,

995
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
or Dawn,

996
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,400
I didn't actually see her,

997
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
there were so many people.

998
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,400
Yeah.

999
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
And then listeners,

1000
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,400
fans of Dawn and Drew show,

1001
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,400
they're like,

1002
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
wow, it's Dawn, you know,

1003
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,400
and it was the same reaction,

1004
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
as I've seen it at a personal meeting,

1005
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
great,

1006
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,400
except no one had the travel

1007
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
all this way to go and hang out with,

1008
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
all people want to do is,

1009
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,400
I think what it's proving is that

1010
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,400
even though the physical aspects are very important

1011
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
of real life,

1012
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
no doubt about it,

1013
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,400
but we've never had the capability

1014
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,400
to fly somewhere immediately.

1015
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
You know,

1016
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
it takes a lot of effort,

1017
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,400
a lot of time to get somewhere.

1018
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,400
So I think it enhances people's lives,

1019
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,400
by being able to,

1020
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
you know, meet Dawn and Drew,

1021
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,400
or maybe they'll be able to go and listen to it.

1022
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
I think it's not you,

1023
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
it is me,

1024
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
it's me,

1025
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,400
of course it's me.

1026
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,400
I mean,

1027
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
when I have clothes on,

1028
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
am I still me?

1029
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
Yeah,

1030
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
okay,

1031
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
you flesh,

1032
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
what do you mean?

1033
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
Flesh and blood and real?

1034
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
I understand,

1035
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
it's not the same thing,

1036
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,400
you would never get the real thing

1037
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
because of,

1038
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,400
time, distance and all of that.

1039
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,400
So isn't that a plot?

1040
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,400
It's more nice to see.

1041
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,400
If you're chatting on the internet,

1042
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
but then,

1043
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,400
but you have a body

1044
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
that people can see,

1045
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,400
and you can,

1046
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,400
you know,

1047
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,400
it's more than that.

1048
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,400
That's what I'm trying to say.

1049
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,400
We've all been chatting on the internet

1050
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,400
on an instant messaging for years.

1051
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
We've been doing that.

1052
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,400
Email is chatting.

1053
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
Yeah.

1054
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
But we chat on email.

1055
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
What are you talking?

1056
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:54,180
Excuse me, you do a hell of a lot of one-line emails to all your friends, your family,

1057
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,940
people you work with, you do that all the time.

1058
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,300
Now, I know that second life may seem a little bit geeky, but what if you just put on a

1059
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,380
pair of glasses and you saw a hofer right there and you saw your sister and of course it

1060
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,380
wasn't easy.

1061
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,380
But it's not my sister.

1062
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,380
It's your sister speaking.

1063
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,380
It's a drawing.

1064
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,380
It's a rendering, huh?

1065
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,380
It's a drawing.

1066
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:16,420
I understand, but isn't that better?

1067
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:22,000
Okay, so here's how it works, so you see your sister, because you do this and you have no idea

1068
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,800
how sophisticated you're using the internet already.

1069
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,100
You find a handbag that you feel that she should buy for the store.

1070
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,100
So you're sending her, what?

1071
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,660
A drawing, a picture, pixels on a flat screen, not sending her an actual bag.

1072
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,860
She's looking at it saying, hey, that's pretty cool, and eventually the real bag should

1073
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,860
be stored.

1074
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,260
I don't have a conversation with a bag.

1075
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:42,540
You have no-be you have a conversation with Iván about the bag.

1076
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,540
Thank you, Iván.

1077
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,540
Why are you doing that?

1078
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,540
I didn't.

1079
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,540
I didn't.

1080
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,540
You crazy.

1081
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,540
It's working, okay?

1082
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,540
It's more oscillations.

1083
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,540
It's wonderful.

1084
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,540
Have fun.

1085
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,540
No, it's great.

1086
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,540
It's great.

1087
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,540
I think it's going to be shot at all.

1088
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,540
I'm not defending it.

1089
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,540
It's going to be a big success.

1090
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,540
I know that.

1091
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,540
I'm not defending it.

1092
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,540
I'm just trying to…

1093
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,540
I'm just trying to…

1094
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,540
Feel it, it's my guts.

1095
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,540
Then why are you pointing there?

1096
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,540
My guts.

1097
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,540
No, I feel it's going to be a great success, it's fine.

1098
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,540
Anyway, so I…

1099
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,540
What I'm doing.

1100
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,540
I want to use this in conjunction with what I'm doing.

1101
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,540
I have other hobbies.

1102
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,540
This is not a hobby for me.

1103
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,540
I'm building a palace.

1104
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,540
I showed you a picture of it yesterday.

1105
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,540
How does it look?

1106
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,540
Yeah, gorgeous.

1107
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,540
Yeah, gorgeous.

1108
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,540
Thank you.

1109
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:34,540
And it's going to be the place where you can see podcasts, music, bands, perform live.

1110
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,540
It's going to be classy, right?

1111
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,540
What is it?

1112
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,540
No cool-aid.

1113
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,540
Look in guys.

1114
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,540
Here that beef cake.

1115
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:45,540
So no one blowing up to the size of a cool-aid jug.

1116
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,540
No flaming arrowheads.

1117
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,540
You know, black tie made when you're classy.

1118
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,540
I want to classy.

1119
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,540
We'll have black jack.

1120
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,540
We'll have poker.

1121
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,540
So we'll have…

1122
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,540
And you really… you play for real.

1123
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,540
For money.

1124
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,540
Yeah, but you're actually really play, which is cool.

1125
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,540
Yeah.

1126
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,540
That lay…

1127
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,540
You know, that lay service.

1128
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,540
We have hosts and hostesses.

1129
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,540
And, you know, so from time to time, we can have…

1130
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,540
You know, someone still…

1131
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,540
People are just going to disappear in this world.

1132
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,540
Possibly.

1133
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,540
Possibly.

1134
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,540
Wow.

1135
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,540
But think about it.

1136
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,540
For people who cannot leave the house, it's wonderful.

1137
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,540
It's not just about… it look.

1138
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,540
It's not just about leaving the house.

1139
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,540
It's, you know, you can't go to San Francisco just…

1140
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,540
Oh, let me go to San Francisco because there's a cool band playing.

1141
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,540
Yeah.

1142
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:33,540
I guarantee you, if I told Christine any one of her favorite bands was on in second life.

1143
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,540
She would love to be on second life, except she doesn't want to be on the dorky teen grid.

1144
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,540
She wants to be on the adult stuff.

1145
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,540
It's too old for her.

1146
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,540
Yeah, it's definitely too old because…

1147
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,540
Yeah.

1148
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,540
Because, and then, of course, there's that.

1149
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:49,540
Because at the end of the day, at the end of the day,

1150
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:54,540
everyone in second life is going around having cyber sex with each other.

1151
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,540
Oh, that is so sad.

1152
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,540
Please don't tell me that.

1153
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,540
That's sad.

1154
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,540
God.

1155
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,540
It's not… it's not sad.

1156
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,540
Oh, I was afraid of that.

1157
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,540
No.

1158
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,540
It's not sad.

1159
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,540
It's…

1160
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,540
I think it's an… and…

1161
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,540
Either it's…

1162
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,540
It's a human thing.

1163
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,540
Yeah.

1164
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,540
I think it's…

1165
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,540
It always ends with…

1166
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,540
It always ends with…

1167
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,540
Fucking for some reason.

1168
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,540
Exactly.

1169
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,540
For some reason.

1170
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,540
Okay.

1171
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,540
And I've talked to a couple of the escort girls.

1172
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,540
Yeah.

1173
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:26,540
In fact, just about every cute girl in second life has it one time or another worked

1174
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,540
quote worked.

1175
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,540
Well, they will love you Adam Newman.

1176
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,540
Yeah.

1177
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:36,540
If I give them a thousand lindens, they love me a long time.

1178
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,540
Lindon.

1179
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,540
There's a lot of really twisted fantasies.

1180
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,540
Yeah.

1181
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,540
Oh, that I believe I know about that.

1182
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,540
Oh, yeah, really?

1183
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,540
Yeah.

1184
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,540
How do you know?

1185
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,540
Well, it's been, you know, it's been for years and years and years.

1186
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:53,540
And yes, people are very extremely strange fantasies.

1187
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,540
Yeah.

1188
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,540
Yeah.

1189
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,540
Yeah.

1190
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:01,540
But, you know, I think the brain is still the largest sex organ we have.

1191
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:07,540
So, if you're stimulating the brain based upon some visual images, I have to say…

1192
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:14,540
I can see already because I've seen the figures that those men have in second life,

1193
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,540
with those big baskets and, you know, walking around with…

1194
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,540
Boy and boy.

1195
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,540
Big muscles and everything.

1196
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,540
Yeah.

1197
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,540
Yeah.

1198
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,540
Well, that's a part of it.

1199
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,540
Well, of course, mine is a true representation of real life.

1200
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,540
Yeah.

1201
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,540
Yeah.

1202
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,540
Particularly my arms.

1203
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,540
Yeah.

1204
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,540
I have arms like tree trunks.

1205
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,540
It's a second life.

1206
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,540
It's an expensive skin.

1207
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,540
18 tackles.

1208
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,540
10 tackles.

1209
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,540
10 tackles.

1210
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,540
Yeah.

1211
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,540
10 tackles.

1212
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,540
10 tackles.

1213
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,540
No, I think that…

1214
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,540
I think there's…

1215
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,540
That's not an area that I'm interested in delving to deep into,

1216
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:53,540
but I think that the way people have sex in second life is something

1217
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,540
new.

1218
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,540
It is definitely something new.

1219
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,540
It is something…

1220
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,540
I'm very safe.

1221
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,540
I'm very safe.

1222
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,540
Very safe.

1223
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,540
Very safe.

1224
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,540
Yes indeed.

1225
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,540
Yeah.

1226
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,540
But it's fascinating.

1227
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,540
And so anyway, so with the palace, which…

1228
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,540
And they're building it, and I'll put some pictures up somewhere.

1229
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,540
I wanted to show you that this morning.

1230
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,540
It's phenomenal.

1231
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,540
This is going to be so beautiful.

1232
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,540
And we have actually…

1233
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,540
We hired people to work in second life.

1234
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,540
We had a meeting on our land.

1235
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,540
I mean, if you get in…

1236
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,540
Of course, it's all…

1237
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,540
It is a game.

1238
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:28,540
But then again, isn't all of life a stage, and each of us must play our part?

1239
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,540
Love is a game.

1240
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,540
Okay.

1241
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,540
We're playing.

1242
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,540
No.

1243
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,540
We're talking to no.

1244
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,540
You're done.

1245
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,540
You're bored with it.

1246
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,540
Yeah.

1247
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,540
Okay.

1248
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,540
So let me just finalize by saying…

1249
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,540
So of course, we have to kind of start small just to see how goes.

1250
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,540
I can't run this thing.

1251
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,540
Someone else has to run it eventually.

1252
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,540
It has to run the palace.

1253
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:53,540
And we're going to give away golden tickets in the podcast, which will have the code

1254
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:57,540
to get into the palace for like the opening night and stuff.

1255
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,540
So that's the kind of stuff that I like experimenting with.

1256
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,540
Am I invited?

1257
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,540
In second life, you can absolutely your invited.

1258
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,540
In real life, no.

1259
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,540
Okay, dear.

1260
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,540
Hey, I just wanted to…

1261
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,540
Bring it one last thing before you go.

1262
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,540
Yeah.

1263
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,540
I love you.

1264
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,540
Oh, thank you so much.

1265
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,540
And then there's one other thing.

1266
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,540
Yeah.

1267
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:25,540
You've been doing a lot of research recently for arthritis on the internet.

1268
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,540
Yep.

1269
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,540
Because you have… is it in your lower back?

1270
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,540
Yeah.

1271
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,540
I've never had anything like that because you know…

1272
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,540
It sure's not the same from time, right?

1273
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,540
It's not the cell phone type.

1274
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,540
I still have my doubts about it.

1275
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,540
You know, I'm very sensitive for these sort of things.

1276
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,540
And I'm a great mover.

1277
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,540
My muscles are, you know, like elastic.

1278
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,540
Yes, they are.

1279
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,540
Yes, they are.

1280
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,540
Yes, you know, baby.

1281
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,540
You are so flexible.

1282
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,540
I'm a great dancer.

1283
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,540
Mm-hmm.

1284
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,540
I'm going to get me one of those poles.

1285
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,540
I'm a mover.

1286
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,540
So it's strange.

1287
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,540
It's very strange.

1288
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,540
But really hurts, right?

1289
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,540
But I'm not telling me how much it hurts.

1290
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,540
It hurts sometimes.

1291
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,540
It hurts sometimes.

1292
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,540
But all the time constantly, or is it better sometimes?

1293
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,540
Yeah, it's all the time now.

1294
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:10,540
And it starts actually from the moment we came to England.

1295
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,540
I'm telling you.

1296
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,540
It's not the weather because it's the same weather.

1297
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,540
Well, unfortunately, you didn't have any problems.

1298
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,540
No, but I didn't do anything.

1299
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,540
Here's the thing.

1300
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,540
I lay down in the sun, you know.

1301
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,540
Yeah, but does that really make all the pain go well?

1302
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,540
Well, if you move around, you can feel it.

1303
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,540
That it's, you know, sometimes it's stiff.

1304
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,540
Sometimes it hurts.

1305
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,540
I mean, I know what that feeling is like.

1306
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,540
It's like my accident.

1307
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,540
I know where it is.

1308
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,540
Yeah, yeah.

1309
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,540
That's what I looked it up on the internet.

1310
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,540
And it's in the internet.

1311
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,540
On the internet.

1312
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,540
On the internet.

1313
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,540
40 million Americans have it.

1314
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,540
Oh, yeah.

1315
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:45,540
And they're going to be another million to get at this year, probably.

1316
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,540
Yeah.

1317
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,540
It's a normal thing.

1318
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:51,540
It was when they checked, for example, the,

1319
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:55,540
the mummies and everything and examined them,

1320
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:59,540
that even in the days of the Egyptians,

1321
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,540
they already had that problem.

1322
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,540
So it's a human thing.

1323
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,540
Oh, yeah.

1324
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,540
Don't worry about it.

1325
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,540
You're not abnormal.

1326
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,540
Don't feel bad about it.

1327
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,540
No.

1328
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,540
But the question was, since we know that lots of doctors,

1329
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,540
and well, and it's people much smarter than us,

1330
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,540
listen to this show.

1331
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,540
Because, you know, I don't feel old.

1332
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:19,540
And I didn't want to read, like,

1333
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,540
Oh, now, you know, this is your problem,

1334
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,540
because you're getting older.

1335
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,540
That's not the, that's not the problem.

1336
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,540
Because, you know,

1337
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,540
you know, even younger people,

1338
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,540
and even kids can have it.

1339
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,540
Yeah.

1340
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,540
But it suddenly came.

1341
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,540
And I want to get rid of it.

1342
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,540
So I read a couple of things.

1343
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,540
I read some newsletters from doctors.

1344
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,540
And so I'm going to cure myself with

1345
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,540
a metal tea.

1346
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,540
Yeah.

1347
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,540
Devil's claw.

1348
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,540
You know, these sort of things.

1349
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,540
I told people you're a witch.

1350
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,540
They know that.

1351
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,540
I don't have to.

1352
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,540
Just my, my eating habits,

1353
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,540
because these are, I think, already.

1354
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,540
So when does it kick in?

1355
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,540
When does it kick in?

1356
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,540
I don't know.

1357
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,540
It takes a couple of weeks.

1358
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,540
I'm going to try to mean, see, and, uh,

1359
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,540
glucose a minute.

1360
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,540
How come?

1361
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,540
So here's what I'd like to test.

1362
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,540
Is there a way for us to test?

1363
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,540
Um, if it has to do,

1364
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,540
I think the way to test it,

1365
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,540
but it has to do with the cell phone tower,

1366
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,540
because I'm still not completely convinced.

1367
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,540
It's strange.

1368
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,540
So when we go somewhere else,

1369
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,540
it doesn't bother you.

1370
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,540
Even if you sleep in a completely different bed,

1371
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,540
even if it's in Rotterdam.

1372
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,540
Yeah.

1373
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,540
I feel a lot better.

1374
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,540
So, but then when you hear,

1375
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,540
it's because I'm moving on,

1376
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,540
doing stuff.

1377
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,540
So why don't?

1378
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,540
I thought maybe because you know,

1379
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,540
I'm carrying it.

1380
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,540
You can see bags and, and, you know,

1381
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,540
I'm my basket.

1382
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,540
I'm carrying you around.

1383
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,540
So why not for, like, a week or so?

1384
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,540
We test it.

1385
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,540
And you sit on your ass for a week.

1386
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,540
And, uh,

1387
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,540
No, I can do that.

1388
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,540
Yeah, you have to.

1389
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,540
We had, it's for science, baby.

1390
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,540
Yeah.

1391
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,540
Now, you know what I also do.

1392
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,540
I don't sit down the whole day.

1393
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,540
You should sit down now, then.

1394
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,540
Even, yeah.

1395
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,540
But would you be willing to test it?

1396
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,540
So that we have, you know,

1397
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,540
we can, I can help.

1398
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,540
Christine, I can help.

1399
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,540
Yeah, I know.

1400
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,540
No, no, no.

1401
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,540
Because the best thing in any case.

1402
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,540
Roger Smalls will be happy to help.

1403
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,540
No, the best thing there is is just moving around.

1404
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,540
Just keep on moving.

1405
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,540
Moving.

1406
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,540
Can we test it?

1407
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,540
Can we take one week out of your life and test it?

1408
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,540
Just to see.

1409
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,540
No, no, no.

1410
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,540
No, I'm not going to do that.

1411
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,540
Okay.

1412
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,540
No, um, let's play one song.

1413
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,540
No, because when you sit around,

1414
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,540
don't do anything.

1415
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,540
I'm going to be fat.

1416
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,540
So that's another problem.

1417
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,540
I, you know, I'll love you.

1418
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,540
You get fat.

1419
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,540
unconditionally, whether you're fat or whether,

1420
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,540
you're fat, you're fat, you're fat.

1421
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,540
Yeah, you don't.

1422
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,540
You don't.

1423
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,540
You're going to go to the second live and play around with those beautiful.

1424
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,540
You better believe it.

1425
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,540
Six feet six to some of that.

1426
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:43,540
Tell big boobs, high heels are girls.

1427
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,540
No, that's not a good problem.

1428
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,540
Another good idea.

1429
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,540
Play one song.

1430
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,540
No more wrap it up, okay?

1431
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,540
Think you like this song.

1432
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,540
This is John Nicholson.

1433
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,540
Love is all right from the podcast.

1434
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,540
Music.

1435
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,540
Then I used to follow in strangers.

1436
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,540
Lookin' for the girl with the flowers in her hand.

Love is out right here

1483
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,540
I don't be the one to reach out

1484
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,540
Save you, maybe it'll come in a twig

1485
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,540
Let's not lie

1486
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:11,540
Baby, you can save me in return

1487
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:15,540
Each of us could give the other way

1488
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,540
It's the fly

1489
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:25,540
You never know it might be the perfect thing

1490
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:30,540
Might even turn around

1491
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,540

1527
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,320
Remember I told you about that.

1528
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,320
It's happening.

00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,320
It's on.

1530
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,320
Yeah.

1531
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,320
I just saw an email this morning.

Yeah.

1536
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,320
That's wonderful.

1537
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:06,480
I said yesterday I said, when I die, the only thing I really care that people will

1538
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,600
say about me is that I helped in this in the Podsafe music revolution.

1539
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,600
Yeah.

1540
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:18,240
And I said, you know, burn my ash, burn me to a crisp and, you know, what's so much more about

1541
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:25,400
is that so many, so many bands, they get another chance, you know, or they get a new chance.

1542
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,400
Oh, dude.

1543
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,400
You should hear that.

1544
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,120
Or band said or and and tell us that never get a chance.

00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,720
Let me just, um, just get this.

1548
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,440
Um, I played a song from Leslie Gore.

1549
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,440
Yeah.

1550
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,440
Yeah.

1551
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,440
Yeah.

1552
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,440
Yeah.

1553
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,440
Yeah.

1554
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,440
Yeah.

1555
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,440
Yeah.

1556
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,440
Because she's now in the Podsafe music network.

1557
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,440
Mm-hm.

1558
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,440
I'm just, uh, stupidity.

1559
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,440
For me.

1560
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,440
It's my party.

1561
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,440
No.

1562
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,440
No.

1563
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,440
No.

1564
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,440
No.

1565
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,440
I'm sorry.

1566
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,440
Not Leslie Gore.

1567
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,440
No.

1568
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,200
No.

1569
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,200
Yeah.

1570
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,120
Now you can have me confused for a second.

1571
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,120
Yeah.

1572
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,480
Um, so, uh, Marc Eosho motor Nemkov, hold on, you know, from Pacific Coast,

1573
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,480
Highway.

1574
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,480
Mm-hm.

1575
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,040
He, uh, have to change this from a guy I hate doing.

1576
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,040
So, stupid.

1577
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:25,260
It's a change it from a, uh, dot M O V file to a MP3.

1578
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,260
Sorry.

1579
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,260
Mm-hm.

1580
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,260
This is very unprofessional.

1581
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,260
But I wasn't preparing on doing this.

1582
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:33,520
So, we interviewed Blake Morgan, who, uh, is the owner of the record company.

1583
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,680
And also of a couple other, uh, pot-safe artists that we've played.

1584
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,680
Listen to what he says.

1585
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:43,000
Undeniably, every single time, um, any of our music has been played on, on your show,

1586
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,320
or on Adam Show, and Adam playing, uh, ever since, um, from Leslie's record, we saw a gigantic

1587
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,320
hit instantly.

1588
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:54,280
Like, we saw a huge spike instantly, and it's not like a coincidence or anything.

1589
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,920
It's, it's absolutely clear.

1590
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,080
You can see it on iTunes.

1591
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,960
We know it happening off of our site.

1592
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,960
There's no doubt about it.

1593
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,960
Podcasting works.

1594
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,960
It's the new radio.

1595
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,960
Okay.

1596
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,960
Yeah.

1597
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:08,040
Well, I wouldn't go so far, say it's the new radio, but for those guys, I always say

1598
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,040
it for the music.

1599
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,760
Well, for the, for the people from traditional music business, yeah, it is, it is the

1600
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,760
new radio.

1601
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,960
It's the new promotional vehicle, and they're selling on iTunes.

1602
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,760
So wait until we finally get everything open up, and the MP3's will be available in

1603
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,760
all the positive music network.

1604
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,400
I think we can actually break some of the shit that's going on.

1605
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,400
It's going to be phenomenal.

1606
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,400
Yeah.

1607
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,400
Okay.

1608
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,400
All right, baby.

1609
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,440
So, uh, I'll check on the, uh, on the navigator.

1610
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,400
We probably have to leave around, what does the show start 730?

1611
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,400
I think it was early.

1612
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,400
Yeah, 730.

1613
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,960
So probably have to leave around 6 something like that.

1614
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,960
Yeah.

1615
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,960
And we'll tell the list.

1616
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,960
I was going to say more.

1617
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,960
What it was.

1618
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:42,960
