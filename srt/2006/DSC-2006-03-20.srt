1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 356 Mr. Look, I am Detective Mahoney, and this is Detective Maloney.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I detect.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Mr. Love, you were picked up by one of our officers after some complete recording.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It seemed you were walking around talking to yourself, and you were asking people if they wanted to answer five questions.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Can you tell us what this is about?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It was for my podcast.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A podcast, it's a sound scene tour.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
A sound scene tour.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yeah, it's...

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay, right after you mentioned to the officer some things, I set all some red flags.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Basically, who are you sending up the river?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
No, no, my eye river to create an MP3 of talking.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Don't bring the military police into this.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
No, no, not MPs and MP3.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Look, we just want to know.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Who you're working for? Who is the godfather?

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
No, no, not a godfather. It's the pod father. You know, pod show, it's Adam.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Who are you sending up the river for the godfather?

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No, I'm using my eye river to record interviews told the officer that the pod father, godfather, whatever,

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
was going to let you quit your day job.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Right, right. If my interview with the stranger podcast goes on pod show.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No, no, no.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What case? What are you running drugs for this pod father to?

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
No, podcast. Look, we just want the truth.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Who are you working for? What are you doing?

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Is prostitution involved with his love house thing?

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No, that's love house radio. That's my other podcast.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Love house radio interview with the stranger there.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Stop talking to the riddles. You need to come clean or throw in your mark.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Like the DSC, Adam Curry?

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
LSD.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
No, no, no, no.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeah, Adam Curry.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Curry from MTV.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes, Adam Curry from MTV.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Look, missed a lot.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Just listen, just listen to my pod.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Point. I'll listen to it.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And I'll tell you what I think.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay, here, just stick to your redden.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Okay, that's not too bad.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah, and you can find it. You can subscribe at lovehouseradio.com

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
or interview with a stranger.com

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And go to podshow because maybe it'll be on their one day.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We don't need no sticky drinks, baby.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Oh, fantastic.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's Adam Curry.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I can't fall down.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
My feet don't touch the ground.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I need to see the wire underneath.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The crown below.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
For the last.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You know.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Well, help.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
To save me from reality.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm losing ground and I'm feeling fast.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I see the sound of a trouble fast.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I never want this to be.

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I know this isn't right.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But this is the light.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm losing ground and I'm feeling fast

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I've seen the sound of the trouble fast

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I never wanted this to be

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I know there's no right, but this is life for me

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:41,000
They sure know how to kick ass down there in Texas, don't they?

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's the longest running reality show in the business

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Good morning, it's Monday, coming to you from Curricondo

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's been perfectly timed, we had a beautiful weekend, the sun was shining both on Saturday

75
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It doesn't look like it's going to be really nice today

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Just looking at my 180 degree view here from the bay over to the mountains over to the city

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Looks a little bit overcast, no matter because it's a week full of all kinds of cool stuff surprises

78
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll be the things that we don't know about of course, good things planned

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
This weekend though, I hope you had a good weekend

80
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Of course, I was up way too early on Saturday morning tried to sleep and didn't work out entirely

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Made until about 830

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Even though I don't remember what I did Friday evening, I think I just went home and collapsed again probably

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah, just hung out all day and I'm sorry, I didn't hang out all day

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What am I talking about?

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Around 2 o'clock, I went down to the basement here at the condo all the way down to P4

86
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And there she was in all her glory, Trinity hadn't looked at her since I got here

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Left rear wing, a little bit soft, so cranked her up, of course, started no problem

88
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I love that after not having run for weeks on end

89
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Right over to the Sanoko station, whatever it is here, paid my 50 cents for the air hose, jacked her up

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And then went out to the biofuel oasis in Berkeley, California

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
This is the place I've been talking about that I hadn't been able to get out to

92
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And of course, I only had about a quarter tank left, so it was either that or pooping in it

93
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And I don't think the fuel filters are ready for that yet

94
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So Trinity, my biofuel oasis beast, bio diesel beast

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Took her out there, this place is really cool, this biofuel oasis

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's basically a garage, literally with the garage door open

97
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And they have two big vats away in the back of

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I presume as a biodiesel that have a nice kit there

99
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
With, I don't know how big those, those storage tanks are, but they're big and plastic

100
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And they two of them fit side by side in a regular car garage

101
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And it's just one person there, now I had my gear with me

102
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But I didn't just want to jump out and say, hey, I'm sound seeing

103
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I actually want to talk to some folks over there and learn a little bit about

104
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
About their operation, so it was just one person there, she was brand new

105
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But she said that she would get someone to get in touch with me

106
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So I can go out there and actually properly interview any of the owners

107
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I think it's an owner operated type deal, it must be six or seven people

108
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Who worked there judging from the pictures on the wall and stuff

109
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And so you basically you back your car in and there's a real pump there

110
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
In the garage, it's a kind of an old one

111
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
$3.60 a gallon

112
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Which is fine, I don't know, I don't have to go through the hassle of making it

113
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And of course, that's not $3.60 which is going to some jackass oil company

114
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's going to some people who are actually trying to do something

115
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And so I'm happy to pay that

116
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So a couple of observations, first of all

117
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Now this is kind of in an almost like an industrial area of Berkeley

118
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
On was it fourth street, I think it is

119
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And so you know, you kind of expect to see some trucks around

120
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Or some beat-up cars

121
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Particularly the ones that would be going to get bio diesel

122
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Well guess what?

123
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
While I was there, I think I saw at least three high-end Mercedes-Benz CDIs

124
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So that's their diesel injection

125
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Whatever, so I don't know what the C stands for

126
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But luxury cars and not old ones, new cars

127
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So that was really hard warming to see that people are actually going out

128
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And going out of their way to go and get bio diesel

129
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Just whatever their reasons are

130
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But it's not because you got an old car and you're experimenting around

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Like myself, people are really seriously into this

132
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So that was, that was just fantastic

133
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Cash or check only, no credit card

134
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So probably not this day, but probably next time

135
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I come into town

136
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Which will be somewhere in May

137
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
To late April

138
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's when we go out there, I'm going to interview

139
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Really nice operation though, biofueloasis

140
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I think it was a biofueloasis.com

141
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'll make sure I put that into the show notes

142
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So then came home

143
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Ron and Martha called me up and said let's go to a movie

144
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I was funny, actually went back out to workly

145
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Not Berkeley to

146
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
How it's the one town across the bridge

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm a little fuzzy this morning

148
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's not even 645 yet

149
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The movie of choice was firewall by Harrison Ford

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Definitely a movie just to go out and see a movie

151
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Technically

152
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Because this is such a typical Harrison Ford movie

153
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Where he has some kind of job

154
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Where he can get stuff done

155
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Bad guys come in, kidnap his family

156
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They force him to do something, he gets pissed off

157
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He kicks everyone's ass, they walk away

158
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
With smoke in the background on the hill

159
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And it's all a beautiful thing

160
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But in this case, it was about

161
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Breaking into computer systems and about firewalls

162
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And I'd have to say in the whole plot

163
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There were about

164
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Probably about five holes I could have driven

165
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Trinity through sideways

166
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
From a technical aspect or from basically

167
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
How the hell could they think that they would never get caught

168
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Doing it this way type of aspect

169
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Because there's just there's no way that

170
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That what they were doing was untraceable

171
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It doesn't matter

172
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Basically, fun to go out

173
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Fun to hang, fun to sit in the movie theater

174
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It was a good theater by the way

175
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
One of the AMC with really good sound

176
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And the picture was nice and nice

177
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't think there's a bad seat in the house

178
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That was really nice

179
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That was almost like a shark jump for me

180
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
When I'm just looking at Harrison Ford

181
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Doing that again

182
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And then I just chilled out

183
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I went to Ben on time

184
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Sunday morning got up

185
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Had a nice long eye chat with the girls

186
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Who were back home

187
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
God, I love

188
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I love eye chat

189
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
When it comes to video conferencing

190
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Just for reliability, full screen, nice audio

191
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
All the little bits and kinks

192
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Worked out, you know, being able to use

193
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Your webcam, not having to use

194
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
External microphones or headphones

195
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And just a nice combination

196
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Macintosh really does it well

197
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Patricia's got the eye Mac and home

198
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I've got, well I have an eye Mac

199
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He was using the power book

200
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
With the external eyesight

201
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So I could take it wherever I was doing stuff

202
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And continue to talk with it

203
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It just really works

204
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Despite the time difference

205
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Between the two locations of the condo

206
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And the cottage

207
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It really, it almost, you know

208
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Patricia was making foods

209
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I just wanted to reach out through the screen

210
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And grab it, that's how real it felt

211
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And then I had a nice walk

212
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Walk down to

213
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
First I went to comp USA

214
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Just to always wanted to go to comp USA

215
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And hang out for a little bit right

216
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Excuse me

217
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Nothing there though

218
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Actually I was looking for a video camera

219
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Because I wanted to do another victim

220
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Like Charlie, another video music cast

221
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Which you probably already saw

222
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
By now if you checked out the feed this morning

223
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
If you are subscribed or you looked at curry.com

224
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And I picked up this

225
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Let me just grab it here

226
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So picked up this camera

227
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Which I've already seen in

228
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
In a different apple store

229
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's the Sanio

230
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Exacty

231
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
As an xxray alpha Charlie Tango India

232
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Exacty

233
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The C5, the exacty

234
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
This thing is small

235
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's probably about the same size

236
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
My blackberry I wouldn't feel bad slipping this into my pocket

237
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's very thin

238
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And it's a steel camera

239
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And a video camera in one

240
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
With kind of a pistol grip

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And it reminds me

242
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It almost reminds me of one of those

243
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
There's like slow scam black and white kid

244
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Video recorders you can get it toys

245
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Or us

246
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
If you have your Cnose

247
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
30 bucks or something except this one actually has some quality

248
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The nice thing about it

249
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The real beauty

250
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Is that it doesn't have a tape

251
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It records all everything to an SD memory card

252
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You got a two gigabyte card in there

253
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Which should be good for about

254
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Things are good for about an hour and 15 minutes of continuous video

255
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And I really really like this thing

256
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I played a lot more than yesterday

257
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Of course hence the

258
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The new video cast that I put up

259
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
But I'm going to be using this

260
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Throughout throughout the next couple days or weeks

261
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And of course I'm vacation

262
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Let's see if I can

263
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
If let's just see if it works

264
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I mean that that's always been the problem with

265
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
With regular video for me is

266
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Okay, so you got to go hook it up to the computer

267
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And then you've got to go find the spot

268
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You've got to read in the tape

269
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's never really made it easy for me

270
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
This thing is cool

271
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If I can do it, let me go

272
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Why don't I do a little

273
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Let's see

274
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Should I do a little a

275
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
A little quick movie here

276
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
There we go

277
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That's the sink

278
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
We'll do a little movie here of the setup

279
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
At the condo

280
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So you can see

281
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
There we go

282
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Okay, I'll post that along in the show notes

283
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Nine seconds of video

284
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh please enjoy

285
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Let's see

286
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
This week I promised the unleash

287
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Of the pod show pdn

288
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Podcast delivery network

289
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And the pod show plus

290
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Listener extravaganza

291
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So on Friday we had a full-blown meeting

292
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
We all sat down

293
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Talked about the actual date

294
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
That we're going to unleash all this stuff

295
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
As you know we've had some delays

296
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Based upon the implementation of strong mail

297
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So that we can actually send out emails

298
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And of course we'll be talking about that

299
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Again in this podcast a little bit later on

300
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So it looks like it's going to be delayed

301
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
By the 10 days delay that we had

302
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Had to put into the schedule

303
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Before the

304
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
For the email fix

305
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And of course I'm going on vacation

306
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
From the first until the 10th of April

307
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And I don't I do not want to be away

308
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
When it unleashes come on

309
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
That would totally suck

310
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So it'll be right after that

311
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's so funny

312
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But of course

313
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'll be jamming with you about it

314
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Up until then because we're so close to

315
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
To getting all this stuff right or at least

316
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Write enough to

317
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
To unleash

318
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Because of the fact that we've opened up rewind

351
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
To all these great guest podcasters

352
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
We've really developed a community

353
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
A network, a backbone

354
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
A pod safe music artist

355
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And pod safe music podcast

356
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So to flourish this new community

357
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
This new network of pod safe

358
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I've started pod safe music forum.com

359
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's really a place that we can all discuss pod safe music

360
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
We can discuss technical issues

361
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Legal issues anything you want

362
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So if you want to participate

363
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Anyone is invited just go to pod safe music forum.com

364
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
This is Marcus Couch

365
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Take care

366
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Right on buddy

367
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Glad you feel better two markets a little bit under the weather

368
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
He was really he was pretty sick

369
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So he's back and got it was so nice

370
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Yesterday just rolling out a couple of those pod safe music shows

371
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What is it?

372
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I snowed their ultimate mix pod cast

373
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Came in I've been listening to bass 20

374
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I've been listening to the chill cast with Angie B

375
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And of course the pod show music rewind

376
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It really works

377
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
This stuff works and then just as a

378
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Kind of like on a on a lark

379
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I have my old iPod here with all my other all my all my license music

380
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Which you know, I don't have any license music

381
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't think anymore on any computer anywhere

382
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's all still on that iPod

383
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's like my archive device

384
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And I ran through a couple of songs and you know

385
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's just like

386
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
First of all most of the songs that that I have in my iPod

387
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Or 20 years old by now

388
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
They're from you know mid 80s

389
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
90s yeah like 10 to 20 years old

390
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's just you know I couldn't get that excited anymore

391
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I just really couldn't

392
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm so I'm really turned on by all the new stuff

393
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And that's never happened to me

394
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's never happened to me

395
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Hey, what is today spring?

396
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Is it the first official day of spring today?

397
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I

398
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What is it today is the 20th?

399
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
No, I can't beat the spring start March 20th

400
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yeah, it's really confusing

401
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's not just spring that I'm sometimes confused about

402
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But mother's day

403
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Mother's day

404
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And father's day as well

405
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It doesn't seem like we've made any

406
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Any progress in some kind of international standardization of when mother's day is

407
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Mother's day in the US

408
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I don't know when it is but I know that it's different in the UK

409
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And I know it's different in Belgium

410
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And I think it's even different in the Netherlands

411
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It sounds like every country is just arbitrarily picked their own mother's day

412
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And it seems the same with father's day

413
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
If anyone couldn't enlighten me on that

414
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'd be much appreciated because

415
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I've got a lot of different moms in my life

416
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
They've got to send something to and I'm confused

417
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Hey Adam, it's Matt Snodgrass

418
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Since there's been a flurry of news on the Chuck lately

419
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Where they have a lot of commentary

420
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'll try to get through these rapid fire

421
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
First, regarding the proposed end-to-digital rights management in France

422
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Which I wholeheartedly support in theory

423
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
However, in reality this just means that iTunes and other online music stores

424
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Will simply close down their French stores

425
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Yes, they will take the stance

426
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'll just take my ball and go home

427
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Second, but you're an internet

428
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I think I've broken this absurdity down to a simple formula

429
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
In no other business scenario, just the supplier of goods

430
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Charge the producer of goods

431
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
More because the producer is shipping a lot of goods

432
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
In this case, the goods being data

433
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And after much thought, I realized the term for what these ISPs are proposing

434
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You know, don't drug dealers do that

435
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The words, using force to obtain money from someone else

436
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And that term is, you guessed it, extortion

437
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
All right, third, I can't tell you how excited I am

438
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
To start buying my pot-safe music on the PMmen

439
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
With a couple of suggestions

440
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
First, pot show has to take at least some piece of each transaction

441
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
To cover operating expenses of providing such a service

442
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Well, you know what?

443
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Let me just see who's about to say something else at home

444
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Otherwise, if things just blow up to millions of downloads a year

445
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Then you're paying all that for all the extra bandwidth

446
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You know, Matt, Matt's not dressed Jackson from time to time

447
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's always good to hear from Matt

448
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Interesting, you bring that up because this is something that we've been talking about

449
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Quite a bit at Pod Show HQ

450
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And we feel that there, that may not be necessary

451
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You know, we've had a lot of conversations about what everyone calls

452
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The split, what's the split man who's getting word?

453
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What's the split?

454
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And at the end of the day, you know, when you look at all the parties that come together

455
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And selling music, it's

456
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
There isn't that much to divvy up, you know, if you want to give the artist a fair shake

457
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And I think the only other person we should be helping in any transaction

458
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Besides the, you know, the standard nine cents for just the processing fee

459
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Which, you know, I can't do anything about

460
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Is the person who helps sell the song

461
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
So that would be in traditional internet, internet speak that would be in affiliate

462
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It's not about the bandwidth, you know, we're going to be giving away the podcast

463
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's not about the delivery network, anyone who wants to use it

464
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So, you know, that's going to be a lot more bandwidth than being used on, in fact

465
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's almost ridiculous how low the bandwidth usage is on the, or how

466
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
We've gotten used to such huge numbers, let me put it that way

467
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And bandwidth usage that what PMN uses is almost nothing

468
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So, you know, I think that we will benefit as Pod Show in other ways

469
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Which may be a little more indirect

470
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But I think it's just going to be worth it

471
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You know, now that Pod Safe Music has almost become a, you know, a word like Kleenex

472
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Can, yeah, it's actually we've gotten it to a verb yet, I Pod Safe

473
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I don't know, so we're not quite a zerox territory, but definitely a Kleenex territory

474
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So, I don't know, but I do know that the minute the email registration works

475
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
We're going live with all of the music which means any artist who has the music on the

476
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Pod Safe Music network can start selling

477
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You'd like a victim of your own success

478
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Second, please encourage the artists to include entire albums when it launches

479
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
A kickass album like Black Lab see the sun

480
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Would never see the light of day if only two tracks are available on the PMN

481
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
And believe me, it is a kickass album

482
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
All right

483
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'll try to wrap this up now with just a quick comment on the trial decision

484
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
What the fuck

485
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
What kind of dick-lic judge can't clearly see a fucking case of theft laid out before her

486
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Hey, how about this? I go steal her car with no repercussions and just promise not to do it again

487
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I bet that'd fly

488
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Okay, I got that out of my system

489
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
All right, lastly, I just want to let you know that you've inspired me to finally create my own podcast

490
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It's called the Daven match show

491
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
So y'all check this out

492
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It's a comedy podcast available at DavenMatchow.com

493
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Ribbit

494
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I've got a lot of ribbit feedbacks

495
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Hey, if you're listening to us on serious stars channel 102

496
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,360
This is the pod show Pacific Coast Hellway is next followed by

497
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
Yeah, use radio dawn and drew and lots of great stuff up until 10 o'clock eastern time tonight

498
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
And I guess I'll just have to figure out themselves

499
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,520
They can download this entire podcast and listen to it. It's entirely

500
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,560
But I couldn't fit the daily source code dot com into the satellite window a couple of promos for you

501
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,560
They're good ones today too

502
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,560
Looking for a hookah

503
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,560
This is the place

504
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,240
The rock and roll geek is cruising for love

505
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,560
Not for himself, but for those who need it most

506
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:08,560
It's Michael Butler's hookah enough a podcast with one guy one girl or two of each and the rock and roll match maker

507
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,360
Michael Butler trying to make it all happen

508
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
Would there be a hookah

509
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
For a breakah

510
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,120
Whatever happens you'll hear it all

511
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,880

554
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,560
www.m-a-r-k-b-a-a-r-s.com

555
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:45,520
Right on Mike Alpharomio Kila Bravo Alpharomio Shara.com, right?

556
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:51,360
Yeah, you know, I got a I got to say that I've been reading a whole bunch of reports from the Netherlands

557
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,600
Of course where I grew up and lived there for a couple of years before we moved to the UK

558
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,080
and

559
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,680
There was a one particular podcast directory. I think was it podcast

560
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,680
I don't even know which one it was but you know they kind of shut down and said podcasting is dead and

561
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,840
Holland and no one's doing it and then all of a sudden people started sending me promos

562
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,880
And I hadn't really received a lot of Dutch podcast promos in the past so it was nice to

563
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,840
Nice to see him come in and nice that they're in English so we can share them and

564
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,440
It's I think it's I think podcasting is very much alive. They just have to kind of find there

565
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,040
I guess I have to find that groove, you know because it is cultural that that's really what I'm noticing

566
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,800
The Dutch audience who wants a different type of podcast on the podcasters were making up until now

567
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,440
A lot of politicians doing podcast in the Netherlands. Of course, you know the politicians always say

568
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,560
I had just started a podcast and I do like one episode and then I just stays there you subscribe to the feed and nothing else

569
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,160
Come through I think the minister of

570
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,360
Defense to the podcast the minister of the interior to the podcast. They all jumped on some some form of virtual

571
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,480
Bandwagon that they saw rolling around a rolling along but

572
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,520
It's all talk no, I'll talkers no doers. Hey, there's more from Holland check this out. This is

573
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:14,720
Actually, it's really shitty audio quality which I'm sure was a mistake, but the bit in the middle is so worth listening to

574
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,160
From the Nau Weekly.com podcast which is a brand new podcast where we talk about

575
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,160
Well stuff that happens in Holland and I want to mention that a few Charlie's ago you

576
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,040
Or a few penises ago

577
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,080
You mentioned something about not using the word Jesus

578
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,360
But using your name. So we we put this to the test and well

579
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,840
I just wanted to hear you what happened this week at the at our place. Hold up hold up

580
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,840
Oh

581
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Gary

582
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
Man, oh

583
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,080
Well as we now know

584
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,440
Yeah, this sounds good actually. I'm gonna we're gonna use this

585
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:13,120
So check out a podcast is on www dot the Nau Weekly.com and

586
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,880
Oh, it's there every week for you to hear buy at him. I don't know what's what's going on

587
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,320
But it sounds like you got a grounding issue somewhere in the in the mixing in the routing channel or something

588
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,280
But otherwise, very funny. I believe me. I would love it. I think it's it's a great marketing boy

589
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,720
Please do not take the Lord's name in vain or or his or his son Jesus Christ

590
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,840
Please don't just use my name when you hit your thumb really it's better for everybody. I'm I'm sure of it

591
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:48,320
I was just listening when I was listening to that. I was thinking about garage band the new i-life oh six

592
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
I picked up a copy of i-life oh six

593
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,960
Since I was at the Apple store anyway and

594
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,760
It was pretty interesting

595
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,760
The interface is a little bit little bit cleaner a little bit different

596
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,480
But but really the garage band seems to be much more stable. I had an editing project

597
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,040
Something I've been working on called the green tech podcast. That's the working title

598
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,120
That's going to be the final title and

599
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,320
And I just decided I'd start editing that in garage band to see how I did and

600
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,480
It you know once you kind of get the hang of it because it is a little different than

601
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,880
You know using pro tools or audacity or deck or anything like that

602
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,640
But when you kind of get the hang of it it does start to flow a little bit. I'm about

603
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,880
30% through the project so I'm gonna do the whole project on garage band

604
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,320
Hopefully it won't let me down and then I'll give you my full assessment, but so far I have to say

605
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:44,800
And I would I've never edited anything on a windows machine. I really only use the windows machine because cast plaster runs on it

606
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,200
And lots of talk this weekend

607
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,400
on the

608
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:54,640
Particularly on a curry dot com in the comments going back and forth with comic strip blogger

609
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,280
um

610
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:03,280
I really you know I have a whole bunch of mixed feelings about comic strip blogger. You know we're kind of getting into it

611
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,160
He was sending in comments regularly which I was happy to play and

612
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,360
And if you were listening last Friday

613
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,400
He kind of went off on a tangent that I took

614
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
I took issue with

615
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,080
And you know that he's he really tried to defend himself on the boards. I don't think he got away with it

616
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,520
And I don't know if this is just a language issue, but it really doesn't matter what the issue is

617
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,720
It's the way that comics re-blogger do it's the way you respond

618
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,040
And if I swear to me because you know he'll send me emails

619
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:42,240
Which just anyone who has ever had an altercation with daywiner will recognize this type of email

620
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,520
It's really amazing

621
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,200
Where an email shows up that says do not for do not post do not blog

622
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,800
This is for you and you only privately you may not do anything with this atom curry

623
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,240
And I've received those emails from Dave winers and sure many people have and

624
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,240
And

625
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:04,000
And it's just like it's actually it's the same type of thing if you have an ongoing relationship

626
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
If you've ever had one with whiner

627
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,720
You know you wake up one morning all sudden. He's like totally off as rocker and you have to apologize to me

628
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,760
You ridiculed me and yeah, it's like oh my god, and so I received a couple of these

629
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,360
A comic should blogger emails and he is saying that I have to apologize to him

630
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,320
For calling him out on his uh what I felt was an anti-symmetic comment

631
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,800
And I didn't do anything more than to call him out on it whether it was intentional unintentional

632
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
It didn't sound right man. It really didn't

633
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:42,720
But you shouldn't get all been out of shape and end to then go threatening this stuff like you know I'll go back. What is it?

634
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,600
You have to apologize to me

635
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
uh

636
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:53,520
Wow god, I'm gonna read this whole thing Adam. See I repeat. I expect your apology on next podcast

637
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,040
I mentioned Ron's ethnicity without any evil intentions just an adjective as many people do no

638
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,280
Dude you listen to the Howard Stern show too much. Okay. That's the problem

639
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,800
You trying to do like Howard Stern type humor and I can hear it. I really can't and I know you listen to it

640
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,640
Whether it's legally illegally streaming or not however you get a hold of it. I can tell you even use that as part of your defense

641
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:23,760
But it's everything's within context man and it was not within context and and I feel that we should be able to call you out

642
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,200
And you shouldn't be so

643
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:31,600
Dicky about it, you know, just uh move on next window please. Now I think you did kind of apologize

644
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,960
But I'm I'm definitely not going to and you know there's there's no reason to get all

645
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,840
Huffy about it. Just go back to stuff that you care about man. Don't get just

646
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,640
Anyway, so we send you a whole bunch of audio quotes, which I'm not gonna play because they're just not relevant not funny and

647
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,320
And not the CSB. I want to have on my show

648
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,200
Hey, I'm Mike Sulee from Ottawa, Canada here love the show

649
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,000
I work in the voiceover IP space and I've been listening intently lately to this bullshit about

650
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,200
Telco's wanted to charge both end points for bandwidth use

651
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,600
And bitching because power users is actually dared to make the most of their internet connections

652
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:14,080
All I want is a pipe and I know this pisses off a lot of ISPs because you don't fit the profile for the quote average user

653
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,480
That some marketing droid you can barely figure out how to open his email came up with

654
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,280
I must say that I'm really tired of this shit

655
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,720
I tried to make your eyes piece in Canada and if I don't use the operating system that they want me to use

656
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,880
At the times of day that they want using only the programs that they want me to use

657
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,880
They want nothing to do with me

658
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,640
Right now my eyes p rocks because it's smaller and it isn't too full of itself yet

659
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,280
They're customer service actually has a clue it's amazing

660
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:46,720
Now the telco's want to treat me as a second class citizen and charge both end points for traffic

661
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,840
The each end point is already paying for from their ISP

662
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,720
That's the last straw man. Fuck them

663
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,400
We need a serious push to turn these assholes into the utility that they're supposed to be

664
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,960
They need to provide an unbiased pipe and then shut the fuck up and collect the revenue

665
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,600
If the pipe goes down or performs poorly, they need to be penalized

666
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,960
I mean it's the way of the future if I get my way

667
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,560
I think that everyone needs to start lobbying with their governments to make it happen

668
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,800
It should be like the damn telephone

669
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,160
The internet is an essential service now and we need a reliable unbiased playing field to keep it that way

670
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
Anyway, that's my rent for the day man

671
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,840
All right, dude. Yeah, I feel the same way and this is this is you know really the email conversation is now coming to the main stream

672
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,760
Remember we were talking about this probably before you ever read about it in the New York Times as an example

673
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,600
But this whole idea of good mail which is this

674
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,920
You know this service that a well and apparently now everyone has signed up for it a well

675
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:54,480
MSN hotmail Yahoo and there's even a Gmail person on the board of on the advisory board

676
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:04,320
So I understand you know, so they're all in on this and and all the conversation revolves around what I think is exactly the intent of the ISPs

677
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,320
It all revolves around

678
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:13,680
Spam so we're stopping spam and the way we're gonna do that is we're gonna charge people to send certified mail

679
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,640
And all of that's fine, but the thing that no one seems to be talking about is that

680
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,560
It's almost like getting like all of a sudden having getting really bad credit

681
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,320
You know, which can happen for a number of reasons it can happen all by itself without you having anything to do with it

682
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,880
It usually these mistakes happen or there's some kind of fraud

683
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:39,840
Which by the way is how you often wind up on spam blacklist is through fraud or someone use your mail server

684
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,600
Of course, I know there's all kinds of things that should be done, you know, there's mistakes everywhere

685
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,920
But that's usually how you wind up on a blacklist and before you know it you can't send out your own personal email

686
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,400
This is an issue the corporations have all over the world right now as we speak

687
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:00,080
Just sending a small small companies, you know, mom and pop shops are running into this problem

688
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,640
So now they're all going to have to pay these huge fees which you know, maybe 300 bucks doesn't seem like a large fee

689
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:13,440
But it is you know and and who died and made you more the fuckers God excuse me excuse me

690
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:21,600
You know, you're just weaseling it's it really is weaseling in onto something that is supposed to be open and free and yet it sucks

691
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,520
Yeah email is absolutely broken, but this is not the way to fix it. I'm sorry

692
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:34,080
This is completely wrong and you know what there's not a day goes by that I'm not rocking my brain for some other type of solution

693
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,080
But this is

694
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:41,120
About the free flow of information without gatekeepers without having to to pay for

695
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,640
Your email to get through that was not the way the system was designed it was not the way it was intended

696
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,680
And I'm really I feel bad that this is just moving ahead, you know, because

697
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,920
Look there's no time the same thing with us. We're paying these you know it's like

698
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,080
$80,000

699
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,080
$80,000

700
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:05,680
I'll rage this amount just so that we can send send off emails and how the you know actually arrive. It's

701
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,200
I don't think legislation is the way to go by the way. I think the whole problem here

702
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,440
What we're seeing down at the bottom and this goes you know goes right into the same

703
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,480
The same issue of ISPs wanting the charge on both sides of the equation

704
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:29,280
You know, so they want to charge Google for sending net, you know, for the traffic that they send onto their network and now

705
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,960
They're saying yeah, it's people kind of backpedaling into it by saying oh, this will be for a guaranteed delivery or some horse crap like that

706
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,360
The problem is it's jealousy

707
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:45,040
It's jealousy at the top, you know, it guys and I think it all it really has to do with Google people are looking at Google and saying hey wait a minute

708
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:50,960
There's a business model where guys are taking all this stuff that other people create running it over our pipes

709
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,560
And they're and they're you know, there's there's big is GM in market cap and then in value

710
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,400
It's jealousy. They want a piece of that they see that their models will never grow that quickly and that they are becoming commoditized

711
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,640
So the only thing I can say is if you guys are really this big and this powerful you network guys

712
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,080
Then you should go buy the content companies go buy a piece of Google, you know what I'm saying?

713
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:22,560
Okay, aggravated excuse me, you know, pull your fucking wallet out and do that, you know, if you look it's like it's like

714
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:30,240
People who invest in airlines, you know, not a good time to be invested in an airline with with fuel prices, you know

715
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:37,760
You're gonna lose your shirt. I'm sorry. Just get over it already, but don't try and hijack into streams of other companies

716
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,640
You know, it's a piracy it's absolutely piracy

717
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:49,680
I know I have faith in the in it's certainly in the United States and it's people and it's consumers people who are consumers

718
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,280
And even legislation if it has to get to it, but I don't think that will ever surface that would just kill so much

719
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,520
I think we would have to take to the streets and riot if they if they really want to go through with that

720
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:06,160
I think I'm not the piece about that here. Hold on a second. Let's see. Hey Adam this is Eric Bergen from green room radio

721
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,720
And I just listened to the Charlie 355 and

722
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:15,040
Listening to that final song Kevin Reeves wasted just incredible. What a great song. Oh, this is really

723
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Just what a great song

724
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,400
Yeah, but it it reminded me to send in some audio feedback

725
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:29,040
Regarding an issue that I've been thinking about for some time and it's regarding the pod safe music network now

726
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:35,760
I love the PMN I use it all the time and I totally get your idea of the unlabel and how it works and that

727
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:43,680
You and the other other people that facilitate the PMN are not in control of its content and then should not be in control of its content

728
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,200
And I get that and I love that the idea that it's not a store, but it is a resource and a

729
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,960
A hub of all those great music for podcasters and and anyone else who discovers the music through podcasts

730
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,840
However, here is my question

731
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:08,080
For so long now musicians and artists have been trying to get their music heard in the the best way possible since the beginning of the recorded sound

732
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,440
Artists have been always you know always working towards a better quality sound

733
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:21,200
In recorded music all the way from vinyl now to not just CD anymore, but super audio CD

734
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:29,360
And now we have the dual disc which you can you know flip over and play the album in on the DVD side in 5.1 stereo surround sound and

735
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,040
All these other inventions to make the sound more better

736
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:45,280
Wow, that was bad. But anyway, you know getting the sound the way the musician would want it to sound the way it sounds in the studio when you're creating the music

737
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,840
Oh wow, I don't know where you're going with this, but

738
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,680
You know

739
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:59,280
Back in the day when there was really like in the in the UK or in Europe when the real top 40 stations with the pirate radio ships broadcasting on AM only

740
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:05,200
Medium wave man people mix their shit down the studio on the crappy as speakers to make sure it sounded good not

741
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:11,360
You know, it's so the it sounded good on the device they expected their consumers to be listening to

742
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,520
So, you know, there's no way you're going to replicate well if you have enough money in the right room and and enough drive

743
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,080
Yeah, you can get pretty close, but you'll probably never replicate

744
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:28,000
What people are hearing in the studio. I think it's very different. You know hip hop is it's very tuned towards the clubs and and car stereo

745
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:35,280
So I'm not too sure about that, but let's see where you're going with with the whole story and I know that when I buy music from the

746
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:41,680
iTunes music store sometimes although I know I'm getting a compressed sound and not so perfect

747
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,800
I know that the quality for the most part is going to be really really good

748
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:56,800
I really enjoy the AAC files that they sent out. I don't know how you feel about that in in relation to the standard MP3 file, but I well first of all are

749
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:06,000
Our pod show plus player which would be able to use from any web browser will of course recognize them and play them also the enhanced version which is is really sweet

750
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,640
So I don't care, you know, it's

751
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,080
It's kind of an open format

752
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,920
You know, and now of course I get a ton of emails people saying it's open. It's closed. It's open. It's closed

753
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,920
I don't know where I will deploy it so it works for me, but I definitely support MP3 above all else do enjoy it

754
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,120
Some of the files that I've downloaded from the PMN are occasionally

755
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:35,200
Not up to quality and I don't even say a little bit more than occasionally. I would say 50% of the time the quality of the track

756
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,320
Isn't up to par now. It's it's fine for playing on a podcast because

757
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,600
When you know when you're doing a podcast you're

758
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,680
compressing it to sometimes even mono sound

759
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:54,080
But for those people who who want a high quality sound especially the people who are buying the tracks

760
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:02,000
Is there any way that we can have a restriction as far as the quality of the file that artists are uploading or

761
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,280
What do we do about that just because I feel that sometimes the the sound isn't up to where

762
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,720
Other people like listening to and and the musicians would want it. I think higher themselves

763
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,040
So that's just a bit of feedback for you

764
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:21,840
I would love to hear what you have to say about that this is Eric Bergen from green room radio the arts and entertainment podcast had green room radio dot com

765
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:28,800
All right, Eric, thank you. Yeah, let me let me give you that my thoughts about that so going back to the unlabel concept where every

766
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,760
person who is a member of the label which includes listeners

767
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:36,560
podcasters artists other people who want to promote music fans for instance

768
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:42,320
Just you know if you take all of that all those pieces transactional piece all of that

769
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,560
We're all together you get the unlabel and

770
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:51,600
The minute you start making a whole bunch of restrictions I think it'll become very difficult the way I see this playing

771
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,320
Is that we're going to we're going to really mel the pod safe music network into

772
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,840
Well, it already is kind of a mini social network. We're going to we're really going to

773
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:08,480
Mel that into a social media network. So right now you have song pages you can see who played a song

774
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,480
You can get information about the artist

775
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,960
But I think what what we're really missing there is some user interaction or listener or podcaster

776
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,240
Who can basically say you know, it's so you'll be able to place comments or or

777
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:27,040
The call them recommendations if you will but you'll be able to respond to each individual song into the artist and

778
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:32,800
And I guess what you might do just as if you were going to download a piece of software and by the way

779
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:39,120
Is there any difference between a dot ex e file and a dot mp3 file? I mean, yeah, what happens with it once you get it

780
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,160
Maybe different but it's still just data you're downloading you've got

781
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:49,040
Programs that that crash and break and spy have spyware and are you know, crap and you have ones that are really good and how do you know about it?

782
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,320
Well when you're downloading I at least I always look at quickly at the reviews, you know, and not the star rating by the way

783
00:47:54,320 --> 00:48:01,440
I actually read what people say if I go to version tracker for instance or window tracker dot com if I really need something for the windows machine

784
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,800
You know, so it's

785
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,320
I think that that's the best way to handle that and if artists are really serious and

786
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,040
You know if they think that they can go without a record company. This is the stuff that record companies do

787
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:20,160
You know, they make sure the quality's out there and it's the and the notes the right bit rate and it's uploaded properly and

788
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:27,040
You know if you're going to do that yourself then as an artist you need to take the time. You know, it's it's 99 cents someone's paying

789
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:33,200
Which may not seem like a lot but look at the competition the competition is what you hear on iTunes

790
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:38,400
So I'm pretty sure that the artists will catch on quick enough if they're really serious. Remember this is all about

791
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:45,200
A concept of they're no they're not really being a need for labels and by the way, there's plenty of

792
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,280
Independent record labels who are uploading their stuff and that's fine, too

793
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,000
We're actually going to make that a little more apparent so you can

794
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,720
Go in by artists as well as by by record company

795
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:03,040
If you want to search around so we're really doing our our best to make that as as broad as possible

796
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,000
But again, I think that you know if we want to be a store

797
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,880
Then we'd have you know if you do one thing you've got to do everything the what we have discussed

798
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,040
And I'll just mention it again is we will be working on the ID three tags when you submit your song

799
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,360
You'll actually have to post X

800
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,600
Number you know pieces of information you can of course fill out everything you want but

801
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,760
The ID three tags will be

802
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,520
We'll be written in properly. I guess some kind of rule if the ID three tags are already there

803
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,080
Then we won't write them in or something like that but we're moving along and I appreciate the feedback because

804
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,880
The only way we're going to get this unlabeled really roll and is is by working together on it

805
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,920
So from the pod safe music network as the last song of the day

806
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,720
About five people sent me this link. I don't know why maybe it's some kind of

807
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,640
marketing

808
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,640
initiative that is

809
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,600
That has been undertaken. Let me just see if I can find some information about this particular

810
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,480
I'm going to my

811
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:01,520
My playlist here on the pod safe music network David it polito who was from

812
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,640
New York

813
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:08,480
Also known as that guitar man from Central Park since 1992 has played to hundreds of thousands around the world

814
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:16,400
But as most at home on sunny weekends in a little patch of grass in New York City Central Park with a guitar on his shoulder

815
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,000
But boy he gets around and he certainly takes the train

816
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:29,040
We call you Mr. Cell phone guy because we don't know your name

817
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,640
The only thing we share is that we all got on this train

818
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,760
We don't know each other we won't be together long

819
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,720
So it might surprise you when we break out in this song

820
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,880
Talk louder

821
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,120
You're the cell phone guy and here's what we think of you

822
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,080
Though you're rude and self-important still we love you

823
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,880
So please talk loud talk louder

824
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,760
Now that's the seventh call you're dialing or receiving

825
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,320
We all need to know the crap you did last evening

826
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,280
So please talk loud

827
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,880
You've allowed us on your train so we'll try not to make a peep

828
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,920
We know you get a call each time we hear that piercing beep

829
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:38,560
Never mind the woman next to you who's trying to get some sleep talk louder

830
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,600
Another phone call to your wife is why we're waiting

831
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:48,240
We all think your private life is fascinating

832
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:58,560
So please talk loud talk louder say can you hear me now each time the signal scatters

833
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,040
Because you know that you're the only one that matters

834
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,480
Hey, please talk loud

835
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:18,000
Make calls about that business lunch and everyone who came and all the TV shows you like and those you think are lame and your friend

836
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Larry needs the play by play of last night's Yankee game

837
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:34,800
Talk louder and laugh out loud as if you're living in a funnel and say I'm losing you each time we hit a tunnel

838
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,640
Please talk loud

839
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,640
I opened up my eyes today at dawn's first early light

840
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
But as I sipped my coffee I knew something wasn't right

841
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:56,080
Because I won't feel complete till I know what you did last night

842
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,600
No, wait

843
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,160
That's not true

844
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,320
No, wait, that's just not true

845
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,880
I

846
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,000
Shut up don't you know this song was meant to be ironic

847
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,800
We think you're boring dog of noxious and moronic

848
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:24,000
You talk so loud hey shut up

849
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,640
If you're getting dirty looks you should expect a

850
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,200
One more call in that damn phone is up your rectum

851
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,320
Because you

852
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:49,920

853
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:55,920
You can be whisked off to it automatically. Hey, good news today is a reasonable hair day

854
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,200
And I'm really happy so I won't have to spend hours coffee

855
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:07,600
coffee because today Cali Lewis our fearless leader from the geek intelligence agency agency is in town

856
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,960
She'll be at the pod show HQ and we're doing something together on taking my camera with me

857
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:19,600
So I don't know if I'll be putting that up as a as a Victor Mike Charlie or just as something separate

858
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:25,440
But I'll definitely be shooting some footage and I'm looking forward to a to meeting our fearless leader

859
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,080
