$1,000 worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And the next generation radio content in my ears.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I like to think I'm flying into this genre.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Fantastic, it's Adam Curry.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The power of the Lord is your Lord.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Delta Shira Charlie 370 and Good Morning from the Curry Cottage.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The Curry Cottage, at least just departing the Curry Cottage.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It is just a little bit past 8 o'clock.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And today is going to be beautiful.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh, it's okay.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We're on the cold.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The sacks are always going to make that a little 3.0 turn to get the hell out.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes, as I said yesterday, I need to get out.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I need to go flying just for an hour.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Maybe an hour and a half.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Why you ask?

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Well, you get my mind off a lot of stuff.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I really enjoy clearing out my brain.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And more importantly, I need the experience.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I need the hours.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I want to get better at what I do in the air.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And today, I think what we're going to do is practice approaches into the airport.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'll tell you the hardest thing for me is actually finding the destination airport.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I know it sounds kind of weird.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I mean, you can find it on your GPS and all your navigational equipment.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But then, you know, as you actually get within about a mile or so of the airport,

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
you should be able to see it and be able to figure out how to line up to land.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And I find that difficult.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And I don't know if it's quite difficult and every pilot will tell you.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But I just want to get better.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Certainly at Farrow's where the Delta Sierra is now park.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Because it's kind of obscure from the air.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The runway is hard to see.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So, there's a VOR, a beacon at Arkham.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The Oscar Charlie Kilo, which is 4.9 miles from the airport.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So, once you hit that, you should pretty much know.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But, you know, it's only 4.9 miles.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You know, if you're doing 140 knots, so that's, you know, 150 miles per hour.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You can figure out how quick you're going to have your ass right on top of that.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So, I want to practice that a little bit for, for, you know, so that I'll be,

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll just be much better at it.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And also, I got to say that, uh, Tom, baby, come on, pull out, pull out, pull out, pull out, pull out.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Go ahead, I'll wait for you, no, stupid.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay, I'm not going to wait for you.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
When we were living at the castle, and I would, you know,

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I had the helipad in, uh, in the back.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't know how many times I've flown over my own house.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's a freaking castle.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So, it's not easy, and particularly when it's hazy, and I think, uh,

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
although it's going to be nice today, there's still probably going to be some haze up in the skies

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
up to, uh, probably about the same altitude that, that we're going to be flying today.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So, I figured I'd take you along for the ride, and as you can already tell,

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I've post-edited this show to give it that little extra cache and shroom

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
to put in, you know, my, my daily dose of, there you go.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I have no problem.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
My daily dose of, of pod safe music.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Uh, and once this is done and up, then I'm going to get cracking on the dev cast.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Uh, got three episodes I want to create today.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Remember, if you're a developer, the dev cast is for you dev cast.potcho.com,

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and if you subscribe now, um, you have a chance of winning a golden ticket

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and getting yourself into pod show plus and the pod cast delivery network,

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and actually help us build out some of the final pieces of that.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Now, this is still, uh, definite rush hour traffic here,

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and even though most people are very kind and considerate in traffic,

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
there's some pissed off people.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Not at me, not this time, hold on a second.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Let me just get in here.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I've decided to take the, uh,

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I've decided to take the highway instead of, uh,

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
through woken, because I'm afraid that the woken route might be filled up with

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
traffic of people trying to sneak in the back way.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So, I've got about, uh, about 15 minutes left to get to the airfield,

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and I'm just going to keep this rolling so that you can,

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
listening, I'll be flying with Jason today who normally is in the tower.

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Uh, he's a certified flight instructor on a single engine.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I think also multi-engine aircraft.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Uh, and he's just going to go along as a, uh,

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
as a safety pilot to help out point out some stuff.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And of course, say my ass should I need it,

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
but I don't think that'll be necessary.

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh, one more thing I thought we'd do today,

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
just kind of, because we haven't done it in hundreds and hundreds of years of

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
feels like.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let's just scan the, uh,

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
let's scan the radio dial over here.

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You know, I'm most of the time when I'm in the car,

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm listening to the radio.

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Uh, and that's purely because it's easier.

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Excuse me.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Let's see what we got.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Let's just run down the dial, okay?

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This is, uh,

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
BBC radio one.

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's BBC radio two.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's BBC radio three.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That's nice for film buffs in today's times.

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Apparently Woody Allen's heading back to London

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
to make a third film with a capital after a match point

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and scoop, which hasn't yet been released.

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He was planning to shoot him Paris,

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
but it seems he's fallen in love with London as a location

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
because he's left him to get on with it.

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, and because there's less French.

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He was his stamping ground in films like Manhattan and Hall

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and Hannah and her sisters,

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
which memory featured this in its soundtrack.

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Barks, hops.

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay, classic.

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Fantastic.

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
How does the travel look?

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Well, of course.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Overwhelming urge now,

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Simon, to mention Spaghetti,

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
the junction for this.

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Nothing to mention about Spaghetti,

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
the junction, but there we are.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The M1, I can mention through Bedfordshire,

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
where he's closed.

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The M1 closed to recover.

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
A multi-vehicle accident turns out there are three vans,

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
two cards, and a lorry of all had a coming together

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
so they closed southbound Canada.

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay.

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Let's go to my favorite station,

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
which is Radio 4.

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's a management.

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And Merley Harper investigates the purest world

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
of big cat-spotting out.

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
All these films and lepids escape the pair.

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Okay, it's not my favorite this morning.

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Here's the hell is this kiss affair?

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I don't know where they're from,

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I don't know where they're from, London, I think.

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's fine.

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I don't like it, everybody.

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I don't know.

140
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay, here's our local station,

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
which is 96.4-the-eagle.

142
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I used to cut the cash paid out the victims of miscarriages

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
of justice being announced by the host.

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay, I guess they have half our news break.

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Now let me see if, you know,

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
those are capital FM, that's one more we can do for you.

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
About 10 minutes and a warmed up.

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You better off.

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But I used for the information I was cycling.

150
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Visit tfl.gov.uk.

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You paid the count.

152
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
How many times did I go?

153
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I bet you could go.

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And then finally we have the virgin.

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh man, God, I like this song.

156
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Sorry, you can't listen to that, not pod safe.

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You know, I'm driving along here

158
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and just about to pull on to the other side.

159
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh man, God, I like this song.

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Sorry, you can't listen to that, not pod safe.

161
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You know, I'm driving along here

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and just about to pull on to the M25.

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm thinking, I need some music, man.

164
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I need some music from our world.

165
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You know what we're going to do?

166
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh, let me just get into.

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Get in here.

168
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Hey, hello, everybody.

169
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Hi, I'm the inner European.

170
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh, on a day like today when you've got sunshine

171
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
breaking through the clouds.

172
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Ah, there's a driving along.

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I need some top-down driving around music.

174
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
There's only one song that it comes to mind

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
that will satisfy Matthew Ebel and drive.

176
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
When nothing stood in between us

177
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
now there's a curve in the world

178
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
so sharp it'll make you bleed.

179
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We don't talk with just punks to clap.

180
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Can't find each other in the same old grids

181
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
or maybe a little escape what we need.

182
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Maybe in the love in your world

183
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
like a dog every morning.

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The city's a pain like the loud taste

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
staying on your dress.

186
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Hit in the bay and before you break down

187
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
it don't cost a dime to leave this town.

188
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're on the road because we got a capitalist mess.

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So let's drive away.

190
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm nothing gonna stay in a way.

192
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Let's drive away.

193
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There was a word in the song

194
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
and I took it for granted.

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But bumping the road not really a part of the drive.

196
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Come on, come on, it's all right.

197
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You made me believe tonight

198
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
the remains is so damn good to be alive.

199
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So let's drive away.

200
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm nothing gonna stay in a way.

202
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Let's drive away.

203
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

204
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

205
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

206
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Sorry, but I've seen fast, but I gotta get going.

207
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
We gotta be more than the coffee shops in the bar.

208
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Lady, maybe it's still late.

209
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Lady, maybe it's just late.

210
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
We need to take my hand and get in the car.

211
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
More and more.

212
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So let's drive away.

213
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

214
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Maybe that's all I got to what I got to say.

215
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Let's drive away.

216
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

217
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

218
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

219
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Okay, here we are just arriving at Ferrox Airport.

220
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Not too bad today.

221
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
About 30 minutes.

222
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Just to be expected, just a little bit of traffic on the M25.

223
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's really busy here today.

224
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
There's a thriving aviation community at this airport.

225
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Alan Mann helicopter is stationed here.

226
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So there's always a ton of helicopter traffic.

227
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And there's lots of cars parked out.

228
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The weather's a lot quite as nice here as it is near the cottage.

229
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Just pull up here.

230
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Now with any luck, my request to pull the plane out of the hanger has been granted.

231
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So let me get all my stuff and walk over, pre-flight the airplane, find Jason and do some

232
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:57,000
flying.

233
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Just walking on to the tarmac here, I can see that indeed the plane has been brought out.

234
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And she's probably been fueled up.

235
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Walking past open hangers.

236
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's a pipe warrior, a foodie.

237
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Gosh, this is so much, so many aircraft here.

238
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Hey Jason, good morning.

239
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I love it, how are you?

240
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Good to see you.

241
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
See, I told you.

242
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
We'll get at least some sunshine tonight.

243
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Because last night the forecast was awful.

244
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah, I saw that.

245
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I woke up the morning and was like, okay, will we have some crap at a thousand feet maybe?

246
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I looked at the cloud meter in the tower.

247
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's about two, actually.

248
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Really?

249
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Okay.

250
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Good.

251
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Where do I want to go?

252
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Well, what I'd like to do is I'd like to do a couple of approaches from

253
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Arkham because...

254
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So a bad weather style approaches.

255
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And also just getting a feel for it because I'm really good at missing my airport.

256
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yeah.

257
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And yeah, it's like, what is it?

258
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Four and a half, four, almost five miles.

259
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And it's like, okay, there it is.

260
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Do you use your GPS quite a lot?

261
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That's a great way of making sure you don't miss your airport.

262
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

263
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Obviously, yeah.

264
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But I also want to do the VOR and everything.

265
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And then we just fly over Gilford.

266
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Get a shot of my house from the air.

267
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Just do a couple of those.

268
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That's okay.

269
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
All right.

270
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'll just pre-flight the plane.

271
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And then again when you're ready.

272
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So it comes to the weather.

273
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah.

274
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Once I've done the pre-flight, then I'll hop on up.

275
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Great.

276
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Okay.

277
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Put our operating handbook check.

278
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Line the gear, leave it down.

279
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Check.

280
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Parking brake.

281
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Set.

282
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Control wheel lock.

283
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Remove.

284
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Adonix power switch off.

285
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Ignition switch off.

286
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Master switch off.

287
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
All right.

288
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That's what I wanted to do.

289
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Check fuel quantity.

290
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yes.

291
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Good.

292
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Line the gear position indicator.

293
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Light.

294
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Check.

295
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
If you're on it's cooling fan.

296
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Check.

297
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Master switch off.

298
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Static pressure.

299
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Source.

300
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Fuel selector.

301
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Both.

302
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Baggage door.

303
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
We'll close that second.

304
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Master switch off.

305
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Okay.

306
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Pre-flight is completed.

307
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And.

308
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That means.

309
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
We'll be off in a way.

310
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And just a few minutes.

311
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Use your upper part at once.

312
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yeah.

313
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Slate to the bug.

314
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Okay.

315
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
No altitude hold.

316
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
No vertical.

317
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Anything.

318
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Or any compensation.

319
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
That was originally the plan.

320
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Which is still the plan.

321
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Okay.

322
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
To get the.

323
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The garment.

324
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Shit.

325
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Which one is that?

326
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yeah.

327
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah.

328
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
The force 30 with the.

329
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah.

330
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's more expensive than the plan.

331
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yeah.

332
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And I say, well, you know what?

333
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
We have something to celebrate.

334
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And then perhaps we'll go through that.

335
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Just like.

336
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Unbelievable amounts of money.

337
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I mean, if you get the, if you get all the servos and everything for the.

338
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
For the auto pilot.

339
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But then you basically fly like.

340
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Okay.

341
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Hello.

342
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Hello.

343
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You there?

344
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah.

345
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Get rid of this.

346
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That's not in the way.

347
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Alright.

348
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
One, two, three, four, two.

349
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's here.

350
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What's farm row?

351
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's farm row.

352
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And.

353
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh, it's going to do all that one.

354
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Shit.

355
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Other.

356
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Looks like the occupier to me.

357
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
That is right there.

358
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I just don't know.

359
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's.

360
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What's that slave to?

361
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's going to go to.

362
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Okay.

363
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
We'll find out.

364
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
We call here for startup.

365
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
We don't need startup.

366
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
No, just get to start the engine.

367
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And once you're all going, I'll make the call to get taxing when you're ready.

368
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Okay.

369
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I don't know if they be on it.

370
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Baby.

371
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Get it.

372
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Oh.

373
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
No, that's not too good.

374
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
No, so that made it a bit more.

375
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Right, being heard.

376
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Something like that.

377
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Bye again.

378
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Ah, that's a little better.

379
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I shouldn't have been green.

380
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Do you need a phone?

381
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh, this is neat to me.

382
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Did you just type in the code of birth entered it?

383
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah.

384
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yeah.

385
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What was the, uh, do our five, seven, we scope once we get our one.

386
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Once we're ready.

387
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Yeah.

388
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So we put our stand by there.

389
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Right.

390
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Cool.

391
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That's the best piece of kit in here.

392
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I love.

393
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I love.

394
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I've seen them when I've always wanted to.

395
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Just type in.

396
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's so much quicker.

397
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Kind of shit that I haven't even figured out.

398
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I mean, yeah, even this isn't all this.

399
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I was just not that bad, really.

400
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Not bad radio stack as far as they go.

401
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The guys, yeah, got most of the, most of the stuff in here.

402
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yeah.

403
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
How come.

404
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Why isn't that doing?

405
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Frequency.

406
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So it's one.

407
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Five.

408
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
That's one.

409
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That's one.

410
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's one.

411
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Three.

412
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
That's the one.

413
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I think once.

414
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Mostly how that works out.

415
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It might be because we're on the draft.

416
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
When I was, yeah, we can always get it up here.

417
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
That's already on our completely or not.

418
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
All right.

419
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Want to call up and.

420
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yeah.

421
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Get us out.

422
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
First information.

423
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Good morning.

424
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
November 277.

425
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Okay.

426
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Okay.

427
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Well, I'll get you.

428
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm gonna test my brakes.

429
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yep.

430
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
want test yours.

431
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Okay.

432
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You know, t more, too.

433
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Let's get to the three.

434
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Just about 0 to 100 long.

435
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Okay.

436
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Item 100, early plus.

437
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Oh, good. Yeah. Oh, over to you.

438
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Looks like cloud is more overcast now. Yeah, so we're pulling about 2,000 feet.

439
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
What can we do around up when you adhere to the end? Just over there, right?

440
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I just didn't know why I tend to do this. I tend to use this large area here to swing around.

441
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Just stop anywhere here. There's no one else around really.

442
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
All right, on the brakes, do a mag check here.

443
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
All right, I need a bit more warm here. Adds a little rough in here.

444
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
One of the ways to clear that, I don't know if you've been told, is to just lean, make sure a little bit,

445
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
and have it running high for a little while.

446
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
About 30 seconds might do it.

447
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Well, that doesn't increase the temperature in the cylinder and it burns off any, any deposits in the spark plugs.

448
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
See, that's the right mag is really rough. Yeah.

449
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The wheel girdle, if it doesn't, it's a problem with the mag, but generally it doesn't burn off.

450
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Just give it time. Okay, so it's not back for, you know, I think it's back for, because I'm interested in a little bit too far around there.

451
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That's the only problem then.

452
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Yeah, just a little bit out, but that's all you need. Like that.

453
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It'll UGT gauges there, yeah.

454
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And it's left, that's both.

455
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Well, your mind is suddenly, you know, just suddenly start working again properly.

456
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
This is not a gradual transition.

457
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Anybody want to do just run it at reasonably high RPM, up to high, because we're not quite in the green yet.

458
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Just to clear it, find works, there's maybe 20, 30 seconds. Yeah, I'll make this way, so it works up a little bit.

459
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I wonder if it's something with a mag.

460
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
In my experience, I've had my drops, it's always cleared itself, but it could be a problem with a mag.

461
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So we'll find out once the engine's walked the temperature warm, and we've done a bit of a high RPM running.

462
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You know, they deposit sometimes, build up on the on the spark plugs.

463
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Well, particularly because this is brand new, you know, the engine's been completely refurbished.

464
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So I think that's exactly what it is, because the mags are new too, I think.

465
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Okay, so that doesn't make any sense.

466
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
What is some breaking in?

467
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
That's exactly what we wanted to breaking in of stuff.

468
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yeah.

469
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Don't worry to use it.

470
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Bye.

471
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
That's really wrong.

472
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
That's just great.

473
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Better be at least getting the green before we can really rev it.

474
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Yeah, that's right.

475
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'd say, once it is in the green, 2,000 RPM for a good 30 seconds.

476
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Okay.

477
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Usually does the trick.

478
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
If it doesn't do the trick, then we have to stop considering whether there is a mag problem.

479
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I need a quick look.

480
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You know, I don't look at a mag.

481
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I don't.

482
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
We'll go the engine here, is here.

483
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Okay.

484
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And then you're going to do your overholsey here.

485
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Okay.

486
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
We'll do them in Antwerp.

487
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yeah.

488
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah.

489
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
How are we doing?

490
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Another thing is, if you stay at low RPM for too long back,

491
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
then you can encourage deposits to build up.

492
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Right.

493
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So let's give her a good dose.

494
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yeah.

495
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Just a plug and just, just a white and till your heat to go up the low and then

496
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:25,000
get the red, then it covers the bottom of it and just on.

497
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Okay.

498
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And then they have hypergtomic seconds.

499
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Okay.

500
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
0.

501
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
0.

502
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
0.

503
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
0.

504
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
0.

505
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
0.

506
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:57,000
0.

507
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
0.

508
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
0.

509
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
0.

510
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
0.

511
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
0.

512
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
0.

513
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
0.

514
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
0.

515
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
0.

516
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:28,000
0.

517
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Nothing else I can think of that we can do.

518
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Usually works from me on doing all those things.

519
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Right?

520
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
We go back back to the engineering bit if you don't have a lift up.

521
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Yeah.

522
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
On November 7th, this year we've got a backdrop.

523
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
So we're going to return to base.

524
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Please.

525
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Why am I?

526
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Bravo.

527
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Hey, Simon, is everything alright?

528
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Yeah, just the less maggots don't work properly.

529
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So we're going to come back and have a lift and get a lift.

530
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Okay.

531
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Okay, so now I have to make a UE here.

532
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
A UE here.

533
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
No.

534
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I would do that.

535
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
We go a little left first.

536
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Okay.

537
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It's actually...

538
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It's indicating the right mag.

539
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
That's right mag is it?

540
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Yeah.

541
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I just need to pass the message on to the tower.

542
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
We've got a mag.

543
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Yeah.

544
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
They don't need to know which one we...

545
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But, sir.

546
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
But usually someone on hand at the engineering department

547
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
to have a good look at things.

548
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Well, this was not the plan.

549
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
But then it wasn't planned.

550
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
But a better safe and so, even.

551
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Yeah.

552
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Take it off with a faulty mag.

553
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Why we do these checks?

554
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Yeah.

555
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And all my 100 hours have ever been in the plane.

556
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It's had a mag that didn't clear itself.

557
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
So...

558
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I think it probably is a problem with one of them.

559
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I think it's quite cheap and easy to replace a mag as well.

560
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Yeah.

561
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
But if we have to replace it.

562
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So I don't mag.

563
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I mean, it's spark plug.

564
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Oh, a spark plug?

565
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Yeah.

566
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Yeah.

567
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It might be some kind of problem with a spark plug.

568
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
More than likely.

569
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
That's very possible.

570
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Yeah.

571
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
In fact, I believe that before the mag.

572
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Yeah.

573
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
But it does sound almost sounds like one cylinder is not happy.

574
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Where do we go?

575
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Just go back to where we were.

576
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And just to a right turn.

577
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And we can just outside my aviation world.

578
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Like where it says my aviation.

579
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It's supposed to be like to the hangers.

580
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It says no parking, but we're going to see them anyway.

581
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
So...

582
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,620
Hello.

583
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
If you can just check out the big way.

584
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
If you can give him, so give him about off now.

585
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Nothing else, just move this gun on my ding声.

586
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Yeah, no problem.

587
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Is it okay just leave it right?

588
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Yeah.

589
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I believe it.

590
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So there's a lot ofgel材 here.

591
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I'm probably in the tower or in the coffee room, yeah.

592
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
All right, thank you, Dad.

593
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Good job.

594
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Okay, let's see if we can make our fly this time.

595
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Yeah.

596
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Well clear.

597
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Yep.

598
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Much better.

599
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
That explains why I didn't start so easy last time.

600
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Yeah.

601
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I think we're going to be much happier with this.

602
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Okay.

603
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Navy on exam.

604
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Break off.

605
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Two, four.

606
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Run away.

607
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
0.457.

608
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Stand by.

609
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Okay.

610
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Want to give me a shout?

611
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Sure thing.

612
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Thanks information.

613
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Good morning.

614
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
November 277.

615
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Delta Sierra.

616
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Chris, ready to check taxi.

617
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Two on board.

618
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Local.

619
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
We're by element.

620
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
He turned up.

621
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Sir, sir, it's a summation.

622
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
He's a taxi driver.

623
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Charlie.

624
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Two for less.

625
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Charlie, two for less.

626
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
0.13.

627
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
November 7th.

628
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Delta Sierra.

629
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Was Charlie up there?

630
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Yeah.

631
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Just straight ahead, basically.

632
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Oh, we're out.

633
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
This way.

634
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Yes, we're head for the yellow center line, which is going to be around.

635
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Yeah.

636
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So we're Charlie.

637
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Sometimes taxiway Charlie is blocked by a larger plane, so you can't always use this.

638
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
But no.

639
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
What a color that one is, huh?

640
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Yeah.

641
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
The color scheme costs more than the helicopter itself.

642
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I was told once.

643
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
The G-Hoot.

644
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Very nice.

645
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Yeah.

646
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Yeah.

647
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
We had, we almost, we got a couple cool redges because we have

648
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
pH in Holland.

649
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
We, uh, we applied for uniform Charlie kilo.

650
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Oh, dear.

651
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Which was denied.

652
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But then we got Alfa Romeo Tango.

653
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Right.

654
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
That's a good one.

655
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Was I allowed?

656
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Yeah.

657
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
We got that one.

658
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
We got uniform November November.

659
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Yeah.

660
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That's, but I really wanted to uniform.

661
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Charlie kilo.

662
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
That was nice.

663
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Yeah.

664
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
That wouldn't have been the bomb, baby.

665
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Yeah.

666
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
But.

667
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
We'll take off the climb to.

668
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
1500.

669
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
1500.

670
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
If you want.

671
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Yeah.

672
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
That's what I tend to cruise ahead around here.

673
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I'll be good.

674
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
The circuit height is a thousand correct.

675
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Second height.

676
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
1000.

677
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
What was the Q&A?

678
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It gives you an H just one zero one three, which is the standard setting really.

679
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Right.

680
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Okay.

681
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
We're good.

682
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Okay.

683
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Off the brakes.

684
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
1700.

685
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Left car.

686
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Right drive.

687
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And now the way around now.

688
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
What's up with that?

689
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It's the other way around to some reason.

690
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
But, uh, but it's not doing what it was before.

691
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And I'm just to make sure we're satisfied with that.

692
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
There was still a couple yesterday.

693
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
But this is the other bag.

694
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Yeah.

695
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
But we didn't just swap them around.

696
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I'm sure he didn't.

697
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Now.

698
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
That's the right bag.

699
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
That's fine now.

700
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Okay.

701
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Let me just check it one more time at 17.

702
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
There we're satisfied.

703
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
That's exactly what I mean.

704
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Yeah.

705
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
The right man.

706
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Glad you have power left.

707
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I am.

708
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Okay.

709
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
All right.

710
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
So, here's the perfect outcome.

711
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
You fell.

712
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
They.

713
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Okay.

714
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Put it back for rocker right now.

715
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
So, this is a tree.

716
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Trying to follow.

717
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
If you want to go on there.

718
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Go on direct.

719
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Talk.

720
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
First of all.

721
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Yes.

722
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
You know, I've been there.

723
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I've still.

724
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I've come and then maybe just.

725
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Turn around and then come in or maybe we'll go.

726
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Off towards being in.

727
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
But then come back and then do an approach from.

728
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Okay.

729
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
The situation there is a candy.

730
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Gladys.

731
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I wish you have to maintain our own separation from.

732
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Right.

733
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
So, well, we'll just go out a little bit.

734
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Just swing around before.

735
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Yes.

736
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You'll come to that.

737
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
You didn't have some.

738
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And EB is where I want to get one.

739
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I'll take care of that.

740
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
You got that.

741
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
So, where we are.

742
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I don't know.

743
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
No, we are.

744
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
So, we're changing.

745
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
All righty.

746
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Yeah.

747
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Are you ready to go?

748
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Yeah.

749
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Number seven death is here.

750
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Ready for departure.

751
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Call to the end.

752
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
From the Occup direction.

753
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Seven death is here.

754
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Take a few.

755
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Discussion.

756
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Seven.

757
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Two.

758
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Four.

759
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
There.

760
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It means.

761
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
On to me now.

762
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Our discussion.

763
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Number seven death is here.

764
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Yep.

765
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Okay.

766
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Okay.

767
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Okay.

768
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Here we go.

769
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Be a nice power.

770
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I was in mission.

771
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
We're speaking to the caterers alive.

772
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I want to put the car be over wait for it.

773
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And it is a just six out of one of them.

774
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Okay.

775
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Okay.

776
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And there she goes.

777
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I didn't take long.

778
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And we have a positive.

779
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Brinks.

780
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Here up.

781
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Wow.

782
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Yeah.

783
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
That works.

784
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I love that positive quote.

785
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
When did you hear that quote?

786
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Five.

787
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Five.

788
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
That was.

789
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Yeah.

790
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Yeah.

791
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I think.

792
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
We're going to farm with help.

793
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Yep.

794
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Okay.

795
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
That's lovely.

796
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Nice to meet you.

797
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Are they going to recall it in first?

798
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
That represent Delta Zero off the Occup shortly.

799
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Turning left.

800
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Here's my partner.

801
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
One two five decimal two five today.

802
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
That's here.

803
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Roger.

804
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Not by the traffic.

805
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
There is.

806
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Measurements for that.

807
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
This is clear.

808
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Yep.

809
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
We just leave about 1300.

810
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
We've been initially.

811
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You got it.

812
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I'm just at the procedure.

813
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Go.

814
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Okay.

815
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I'm here.

816
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm here.

817
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I'm here.

818
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm here.

819
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
We can turn right.

820
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
We want towards our vehicle.

821
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
We're left.

822
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Clear.

823
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
We're going down.

824
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
We're going down.

825
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Probably we don't get out the new number.

826
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
777 Delta Zero.

827
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Two ships.

828
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Delta Zero.

829
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
We're going down.

830
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
777 Delta Zero.

831
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
So we move around.

832
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
We're going down.

833
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Turn right.

834
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Two ships.

835
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Two ships, sixnm.

836
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Four ships.

837
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
5,500…

838
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Yehey one, two, one, three, two, and four five.

839
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
We're staying at 777 Delta Zero.

840
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Okay.

841
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Reserv so.

842
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,160
This side is

843
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:34,240
Okay, do you see the yellow on the MF2, that's about to pull everything back, I feel 24, 24, 24,

844
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,740
24 hours of exploration, 12-�pai..

845
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:44,360
There are a lot of tombs in the short local flight, so we are walked up and then a little bit further,

846
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:49,940
there is there is tombs that 살� members, someaign Local.

847
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,260
Okay, Walkup is on the nose, is that the SQS area which is just below us from the啦.

848
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,760
Can you see that sort of three miles away?

849
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,900
Okay, visual, right there, it's welcome.

850
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,700
That's where the VOR is, right?

851
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,380
Beautiful, very smooth.

852
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,500
Turn down the heat of the VOR, there's no fucking fire.

853
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,860
That's our VOR, see if we just overfly that?

854
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,860
You'll get it, absolutely.

855
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,100
It's just the VOR side, that's all it is now.

856
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,140
This is their fuel.

857
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,740
All greens, everything went pretty good, huh?

858
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,940
Yeah, everything's what should be.

859
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:33,140
What I was suggest is an outbound flight from the VOR,

860
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:37,140
zero, nine, five, and greens, can't be between all the control there's, right?

861
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,140
Okay.

862
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,140
Now, we're going to see those, there's not much of a procedure.

863
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,140
Don't run, what do you go, man?

864
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,140
It's a challenge there.

865
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,140
A little bit of a bit of a need.

866
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,140
That needs a bit of funding.

867
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,140
Right now.

868
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,140
That's not the worst.

869
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,140
Three, four, four, four, fifth, and left.

870
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,140
Zero, nine, five.

871
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:56,140
Zero, nine, five, two, one, two, one, four, one.

872
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,140
There's one, three, two, four, four, and two.

873
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,140
That's just the end of, um, on your approach in the fair,

874
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,140
if you're just going to show this side of the M25,

875
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,140
which is that huge motorway down there.

876
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,140
You want to enter control there, space.

877
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,140
No, no, no, no, no, no.

878
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,140
We've got it.

879
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,140
When you get the go-stop, you're going to go to the M25, right?

880
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,140
I'm trying to push you back, push you back, push you.

881
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,140
We passed it over the M2, race course, that mission.

882
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,140
Right there, right there.

883
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,140
Yeah, which helps us a bit into each other.

884
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,140
You have a side of control there, space.

885
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,140
Oh, and you say race course, you mean horses?

886
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

887
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,140
Don't race them.

888
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:35,140
I'm like, looking for, uh, the Ferraris.

889
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,140
Uh, no, that's fine.

890
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,140
I think we're still bestowing.

891
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,140
Just the other day on Monday.

892
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,140
And there are also little things to drive around and round on that one.

893
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,140
Yeah, that's nice.

894
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:48,140
Okay, this is kind of a bad state.

895
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:52,140
Alright, we're going to come up right close to the cannelly riding side,

896
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:56,140
which we'll be on the nose when I need to give you our separation from such as turning around.

897
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,140
Yeah, we're going over left.

898
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,140
We can just go right to the way from the Heathrow, which is that.

899
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,140
Yeah, it's got to okay.

900
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,140
Yeah, that's good.

901
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,140
Alright.

902
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,140
If you want, just strike back to horsey.

903
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,140
If you want.

904
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:15,140
One for the first, the other, the second, the second.

905
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,140
One for the first, the second.

906
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,140
The second, the second, the second.

907
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,140
The second, the second.

908
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,140
The second, the second.

909
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,140
The second.

910
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,140
Well, you definitely got to fry in a couple minutes then too, right?

911
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,140
Yeah.

912
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,140
If you still want to go to South Coast, sir.

913
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,140
It's a turn sign.

914
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,140
Where am you going to go?

915
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,140
It's one thing you still wanted to go to South Coast.

916
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,140
Um, you've listed this approach.

917
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,140
Yeah.

918
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,140
Let's do a touching go.

919
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,140
Okay.

920
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,140
And then we'll head down to the coast and you'll fly the proof in.

921
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,140
Okay, exactly.

922
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,140
Let's fly over to South Coast, let her head.

923
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,140
Yeah, hold her that.

924
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,140
But once we hit the arc of them, we go 3-0-8.

925
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,140
Yeah.

926
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,140
Straight to furrows.

927
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,140
Yeah.

928
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,140
I'll start shooting furrows now for you.

929
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,140
Okay.

930
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,140
Then I'll first have it down to zero.

931
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:56,140
Just approach the arc of the east or the back to furrows-1-3-3-4-4-2.

932
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,140
Mission.

933
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,140
Mission.

934
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,140
Mission.

935
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,140
Mission.

936
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,140
Mission.

937
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,140
That's what I like.

938
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,140
Mission.

939
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,140
Mission.

940
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,140
imagine a location in the number 7.

941
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,140
277-7-6-3-4-3-4.

942
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,140
Is that so?

943
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,140
It doesn't see her face information.

944
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,140
24-8-7-4-4-3-4.

945
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,140
Is she bullet at fq-1-0-1-0 on zero?

946
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,140
It's the number 7-7-7-7.

947
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,140
Make that one zero on zero.

948
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,140
Thank you.

949
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,140
Let's take a look at the number 7 of the others here.

950
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,140
Hey guys, what's there?

951
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,140
Thank you.

952
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,140
Take a seatbelt, quite clearly.

953
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,140
It's the grassy area with the kind of white buildings right there.

954
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,140
Our corner, yes, yeah.

955
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,140
The beautiful catering is the walking tower block as well.

956
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,140
Just let you know that you're near over there.

957
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,140
All right, okay, gotcha.

958
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,140
Here we go.

959
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,140
Three, zero.

960
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,140
Hey, what's your composition?

961
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,140
Before I get one.

962
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,140
Just let you know what that is.

963
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,140
Okay, let's go down with my traffic.

964
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,140
So here we go.

965
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,140
There we go.

966
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,140
All right.

967
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,140
I want to set the QF1 to 0.

968
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,140
0.

969
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,140
I want to run over here, actually.

970
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,140
This is going to run down with my traffic.

971
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,140
I'm going to run over here, actually.

972
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,140
This is going to run down with my traffic.

973
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,140
Okay, so we just turn around.

974
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,140
And just let's go up and we'll be fine.

975
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,140
Yeah.

976
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,140
Still a picture with this guy.

977
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,140
Yeah.

978
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,140
Can we descend to circuit high.

979
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,140
Now we'll probably get a vertical chance of spotting him.

980
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,140
I've got to pick a roll out now.

981
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,140
What do you want when you're ready?

982
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,140
This is for less.

983
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,140
Okay, well he's way over there.

984
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,140
He's on less base.

985
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,140
I'm sure to find all the way to.

986
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,140
We'll just that way.

987
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,140
Okay.

988
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,140
Still.

989
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,140
He doesn't want to slow down, you know.

990
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,140
Okay, we can make our turn here.

991
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,140
We'll wait until he wants the electric.

992
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,140
And the number 7 tells us here.

993
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,140
We're now positioning.

994
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,140
We're going to local file for our way to.

995
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,140
And if the 7 does to him, I'm not sure that.

996
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,140
He's going to slow us down.

997
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,140
We'll touch again.

998
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,140
Copy.

999
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,140
And just to never go further.

1000
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,140
Just at the end of 25, just that busy motorway.

1001
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,140
Okay.

1002
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,140
Okay.

1003
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,140
So it's a three touch.

1004
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,140
We've got all that near the question.

1005
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,140
It's a three and seven, two and three.

1006
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,140
I don't know.

1007
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,140
I've got to go and find all this well ahead.

1008
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,140
Back to touch down.

1009
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,140
I got to be sure.

1010
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,140
He's in the back shot.

1011
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,140
Master in the horizon.

1012
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,140
That's a great good.

1013
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,140
All the way in the back.

1014
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,140
I don't think that helps you keep that aside.

1015
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,140
Control this.

1016
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,140
If anybody in that way is a good reference to the future.

1017
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,140
Back shot.

1018
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,140
Number 7 tells us here.

1019
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,140
We're turning front.

1020
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,140
We're only two four.

1021
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,140
It's a touch and go.

1022
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,140
No, no, no, no, no.

1023
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,140
It's a three and three.

1024
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,140
No, no, no.

1025
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,140
One, two, no.

1026
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,140
My discretion will decrease.

1027
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,140
Number 7 tells us here.

1028
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,140
No likes today.

1029
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,140
No one on the other one that you want.

1030
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,140
How do you turn them on?

1031
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,140
We can turn them out to do it.

1032
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,140
Oh.

1033
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,140
Okay.

1034
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,140
Let's do it without.

1035
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,140
Okay.

1036
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,140
I was just thinking this might happen.

1037
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,140
There's okay.

1038
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,140
Yeah, that's just about right.

1039
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,140
About three degrees.

1040
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,140
Okay.

1041
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,140
Ready to go?

1042
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,140
Yeah.

1043
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,140
Positive.

1044
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,140
Brakes.

1045
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,140
Here we go.

1046
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,140
Fantastic.

1047
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,140
Okay.

1048
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,140
Just the one circuit you want to do is sort of the farm.

1049
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,140
But now.

1050
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,140
Yeah.

1051
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,140
Okay.

1052
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,140
But you want to play over?

1053
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,140
Yeah.

1054
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,140
I was going to go for the first half.

1055
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,140
Yeah.

1056
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,140
Thinking and fine.

1057
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,140
To this.

1058
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,140
This is the area of balance here.

1059
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,140
Yeah.

1060
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,140
The second half.

1061
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,140
Yeah.

1062
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,140
Let's see.

1063
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,140
Okay.

1064
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,140
Right.

1065
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:51,140
See this.

1066
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,140
Of course.

1067
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,140
There.

1068
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,140
See this patch that sticks out there.

1069
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,140
See those buildings.

1070
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,140
The five buildings.

1071
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,140
Which would look like it's.

1072
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,140
Government.

1073
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,140
More than relationships.

1074
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,140
There's a decision.

1075
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,140
This is the right area.

1076
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,140
Yeah.

1077
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,140
Right hand side.

1078
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,140
So you just won't fly straight for a second.

1079
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,140
Yeah.

1080
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,140
Okay.

1081
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,140
So there's that.

1082
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,140
This set of building.

1083
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,140
Yeah.

1084
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,140
Yeah.

1085
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,140
And we're right behind that.

1086
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,140
Yeah.

1087
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,140
So you can see the parking.

1088
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,140
The parking lot right there.

1089
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,140
I see the dinner building.

1090
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,140
And then next thing you see that.

1091
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,140
That house with the pool.

1092
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:24,140
Yeah.

1093
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,140
