5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,400
terrifying.

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,280
Doc, let's go and go to see if I can see it.

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,840
I was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,680
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,120
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

13
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,960
I'm flying into the rising sun.

14
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
I'm flying into the rising sun.

15
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,960
I'm flying into the rising sun.

16
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,240
She is a whole different generation of how.

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,280
Feel it in my arms.

18
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,960
My American tank came up.

19
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,240
She needs to see.

20
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,640
My American tank came up.

21
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,920
She's so good to me.

22
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,520
Talk about her life before you.

23
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,200
There's literally this thing changing.

24
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,960
It's my fear of the weather.

25
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,200
My American tank came up.

26
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,920
She needs to see.

27
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,920
My American tank came up.

28
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,520
She's so good to me.

29
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,240
I'm a whole kids now belong.

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,240
So far away from the garden in love.

31
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,640
She is one new generation of how.

32
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:12,400
So I will see just how black was my life.

33
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,640
When we're alone in the city of light.

34
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,400
Yeah.

35
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Yes.

36
00:03:34,400 --> 00:04:04,400

43
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,960
Thank you, see you in the next video, bye bye, click!

44
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,220
Well, in the next video, see you in the next video, please, click, n fragrant and check them out!

45
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,300
You, pity, Fun!

46
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:00,640
Easy, fast!

47
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,480
Oh, man.

48
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,080
What a way to kick off a week.

49
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
Love it!

50
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,640
Over for Tokyo, live coming to you from the Podsafe Music Network, thanks to Michael

51
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:14,160
Butler for the tireless effort of getting DP on the PMN.

52
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,760
Man, that really, and did not go on notice, by the way.

53
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,360
All weekend, long podcast, all over the world, we're playing Deep Purple.

54
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
Why?

55
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
Why were they playing Deep Purple?

56
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,640
Because they can.

57
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
Man.

58
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
Hold on a second.

59
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
What?

60
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Don't interrupt me with you.

61
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,120
It's the Daily Source Code.

62
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,920
It's Monday coming to you from the affluent suburb of Surrey in the UK known as Gilford,

63
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,640
shit weather today, or should I say, shite, but this really, really made me feel good.

64
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,920
So happy to play this for you.

65
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,840
It's from a brand new album.

66
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,320
It's called Rapture of the Deep, the lineup, which, of course, has changed throughout

67
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:57,960
the years on this double CD set, consists of in-gill on vocals, in-pays on drums,

68
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,240
the Roger Glover on bass, of course, oh, man.

69
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,480
What I love to have love is all on the podcast music network.

70
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:11,920
Steve Morrison, guitar, and Don area as a keyboard, it's chock-full, and this is what's

71
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
so cool.

72
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,400
Obviously, women from Tokyo probably belong to some record company somewhere.

73
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,520
And these guys would never be able to put it up on the podcast music network, but what

74
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,520
a concept, take a live version, record that.

75
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,600
You own the master, you already own the words and the music.

76
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,360
So bottoming, put it up on the podcast music network.

77
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,360
So there's actually, there's another live version on the track, although not on the CD,

78
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,960
not on the podcast music network.

79
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,920
What is it to smoke on the water, another live version?

80
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,840
This CD is just chock-full of great stuff, and I'm going to play another track from

81
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
it later on.

82
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,200
They have another, one of the track, which I won't play today, called MTV, nice little

83
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,720
slag at them, check that out.

84
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,960
Links, of course, in the show notes at dailysourceco.com, so you can find deeper pull

85
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,680
on the podcast music network.

86
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,960
Wow, I'm so happy.

87
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,000
It really, really makes my day great work, Michael, and there's another artist who popped

88
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
up over the weekend.

89
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,600
George Thurgood, now also on the podcast music network.

90
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,280
This is exactly what we hoped for.

91
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:16,240
We knew we were so sure that artists who have an established name just won't be able to

92
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,640
make it in today's music business, because it's all about the quick pop, the big hit,

93
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,200
the rake in the dough, and fuck the artist.

94
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
I'm sorry.

95
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
That's just the way it is.

96
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,560
Now that these artists have some stuff under their own control, such as recording their

97
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,200
own live concerts, releasing new songs, releasing new records, and putting stuff up

98
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,400
so podcasters can share them with you on the podcast music network.

99
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
I've said it many times.

100
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,440
There's nothing as powerful as someone saying, I love that fucking song.

101
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,400
No recommendation engine can top that.

102
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Who?

103
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,560
Hey, was a lightweight weekend, otherwise you probably followed along on my weblog, maybe

104
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,120
didn't, but I was planning on doing a touch and go landing practice all weekend.

105
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:02,160
Actually, all Saturday, a Saturday, we had cloud ceilings of 400 feet, so that's a non-starter

106
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
regardless.

107
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:09,440
Sunday, we had thunderstorms, high gusts of winds, which is perfect to fly in, but not

108
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,520
very convenient for landing practice, because you're basically fighting the elements

109
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,320
more than you're learning anything.

110
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,320
So that's been postponed to either this week or the end of the week.

111
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,800
You know, we had to do something else.

112
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,640
You might have seen perversion for profit, my very first video podcast show.

113
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,720
Well, it's not the first test I've done, but I think I'm finally, I finally found some

114
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,680
software from serious magic.

115
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:39,320
They have a package called vlogger, which I hate as a name personally, and it doesn't,

116
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,000
it is basically the same package, but doesn't have a lot of the things in there that

117
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I would need.

118
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,880
So I went for the $498 version.

119
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,840
It's to be delivered on CD, so I still have that big demo written across the screen.

120
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,800
But once I get the software in, I'll re-render that show, and we'll continue.

121
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,240
I don't know if this is going to be a weekly thing, or maybe a couple of times a week,

122
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,240
it just kind of depends.

123
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,280
It really depends on how fast I can produce stuff, because that's what really cuts in.

124
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,560
Even producing the source code from start to finish, from prepping the show to actually

125
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,000
being done and walking away and it being up and checked in everything rolling.

126
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,480
It's a minimum of three hours.

127
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,960
It takes about the same amount of time for one of those three-minute video shows.

128
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:34,160
Anyway, if you're playing the show in iTunes, or perhaps in Windows Media Play, or any

129
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,280
other player, or even on a portable player, you might see a fantastic new artwork, thanks

130
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,240
to NeckDrek for giving me some custom icons for Daily Source Code 441.

131
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,320
The intro's coming in fast and furious as well.

132
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,480
That was a Dutch intro today, introducing episode 441.

133
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,600
Send them in for me, please.

134
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:59,800
I need 442 all the way through a thousand, if you know mine, so just send them in.

135
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,760
Just a short little thing, something creative, something fun.

136
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,160
I really appreciate it.

137
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:11,200
It takes a lot of the tediousness, and I think just the boring tags out of my life and

138
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,600
put them back into your creative hands.

139
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,800
Quite a show lined up for you.

140
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,600
We've got all kinds of cool stuff to talk about, including some corrections.

141
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,720
Hey Adam, this is Manu, aka Spuds, the producer of the Hamister Jesse Podcast.

142
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,120
I was listening to DSC 434 when you played this song.

143
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,360
I'm confident and reforming to feel all right.

144
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:41,600
Yep, it's coffee and refer by my buddy Ron Sunshine.

145
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,760
I just want to clear up a couple of things.

146
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,600
First off, you mentioned that you found the coffee and refer song from the podcast called

147
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
The Jazz Sweet.

148
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Now, while that's a great show, I'm pretty sure that's not where you've got the song.

149
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,920
You see, the song isn't quite hot-safe, at least not yet.

150
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,600
The tune was featured on a different podcast called Hamister Jesse.

151
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,200
Hey, I'm Mr. Jesse.

152
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,960
You show of gaps in fine, Bobby Coo.

153
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,280
Hosted by Jesse Miner and Produced I.

154
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Well, me.

155
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,600
It's a show that features swinging jazz and blues, you know, the good stuff that Patricia

156
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
thinks.

157
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,520
Well Ron Sunshine gave us permission to play coffee and refer on our podcast, because

158
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,920
he happens to be a personal friend of Jesse and I.

159
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,280
We also have an interview with Ron and even more of his great music.

160
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:36,440
Go to potshow.com and search for Hamister Jesse and my S-T-E-R-J-E-S-S-E to get the show.

161
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,760
And you can also get more of Ron's great music at Ron Sunshine.com.

162
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,040
Also, we noticed that I'm that you subscribed to Hamister Jesse.

163
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,640
A little bird at Potshow HQ told us that you heard it and jumped on board.

164
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,640
Thanks a lot.

165
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,800
And I think I can answer your question, you posted on Potshow, what's a lindyhopper?

166
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,480
Basically, a lindyhopper is the old school term for swing dancer.

167
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,480
So now, you know, I wouldn't normally send in a comment, but Jesse Miner is the host

168
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,480
of the show.

169
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,480
And he just got married and he's on his honeymoon.

170
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,280
So I thought a cool plug for a show on the Charlie would be a great wedding gift.

171
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,640
Thanks to Tanya Adam, oh and a scrunch scrunch.

172
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,760
I do thank you, sorry for the mix up there, but I really do love the show.

173
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,280
Yeah, I'm subscribed, absolutely.

174
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:26,640
And I'd already found out from our financial wizard extraordinaire, Cindy, who is a lindyhopper.

175
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
Exactly what it was.

176
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,920
It's coming back, man.

177
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,720
The big band, the sound of the swing, it's all coming back.

178
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:41,120
While I'm on the apology path, made a mistake on Friday's show, I falsely accused

179
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:48,080
Podcast Paul of leaving a snooty comment at acure.podshow.com, without having actually

180
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
listened to the show.

181
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
It wasn't podcast, Paul.

182
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,920
It was Paul Pinfield.

183
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,840
There's too many Pauls in the UK in podcasting.

184
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:02,000
Anyway, so I'm sorry, Podcast Paul and Paul Pinfield, well, I've already been talking

185
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,840
to him over the weekend, so everything's all pretty much straightened out, but I did have

186
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,040
to do a public apology.

187
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,160
Something interesting that I read on Valleywag.

188
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,800
I don't know if you are aware of Valleywag.com.

189
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,520
It's basically, it's kind of like a tabloid for Silicon Valley.

190
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,560
And sometimes some great nuggets show up.

191
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:25,280
For instance, if you are a content producer for Verizon and you produce content that is

192
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:31,120
currently delivered through the Verizon Wireless Network, which basically means cell phones,

193
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,600
there are some restrictions you should be aware of.

194
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,920
Oh, yes.

195
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,560
Valleywag posted this, so I'm going to presume that it's correct.

196
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:48,320
This is guidelines for publishing content on Verizon.

197
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,560
No content provided to subscribers of Verizon Wireless from content providers, where

198
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,360
then the form of text audio images, video, or otherwise may contain any of the words listed

199
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,080
in appendix A. This includes any variations in spelling of the words, e.g. fuck, fuck,

200
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,560
Ph.h. fucks, fucker, fuck, fucking, et cetera.

201
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,360
Oh, I should have mentioned this shows definitely, and this portion certainly not family

202
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,720
safe.

203
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,160
So basically, I mean, it's all, it's their right, it's their network.

204
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:22,200
They can, they can tell anyone to do whatever they want, but it seems like we won't be

205
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:28,440
having podcasts freely and openly available on a network like Verizon in the near future.

206
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,200
I just like to run down the list of words they have.

207
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:39,280
Some of them, I feel are completely out of order, are part of the daily vernacular vocabulary

208
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:48,000
that we use, but you won't be able to do that if you're producing content for Verizon.

209
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Listen to the list.

210
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,800
I'll just run down really quickly.

211
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,440
Anal asked bastard beat off bitch B.J. camel jockey, chink, circle, jerk, clit, cock,

212
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,160
cooly, cune, cornhole, cunt, dego, deep-throating dickhead, dickwad, dildo, dyke, eat me,

213
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,440
fag, faggot, philasio, fisting, flesh, flute, flesh, popsicle, forticate, fuck, fudge, packing,

214
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,840
gang bang, genital, get laid, gobb the knob, golden shower, gook, hair, pie, hard on, homo,

215
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:17,480
honky, jerk off, juboy, jizz, five, kike, lesboh, limey, man loaf, masturbate, muff

216
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:23,200
diver, nigger, nut sack, packy, pan, face, pwn, tank, pubic pussy, queef, queer, raghead,

217
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,840
rim job, ruby, red bag, scrotum, shit, sit on my face, 69, slags, slants, otomize, spank

218
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:34,880
the monkey, spear chucker, spick, spooky, tea bag, and testicles, twat, vagina, wet back, whack

219
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,000
off, whip it out, white swallow, and wop.

220
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,080
Some of those words, I don't think are that offensive.

221
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,880
What is up with the number five?

222
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:52,880
We've banned the number five, holy crap, I'm sure now I'm guaranteed to have no spot on

223
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:59,440
the Verizon wireless network, that's for sure, oh, big shake up in second life, I said

224
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,600
that if Durandran was coming into second life, I think this is Friday's show, I said,

225
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,840
that's it, I'm out, I'm done, and I do kind of mean that, but that doesn't mean that

226
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,520
the pod show island is going away, not at all, doesn't mean that I don't stop by to hang

227
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,600
out in meet friends, I just don't see it, second life just became a non hit place

228
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:25,320
from me, it just did, stop, I am in Brittany Mason, who of course is running the whole

229
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:30,320
pod show island, stop, I aming early, is the island going away, the island is not going

230
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,320
away, I'm not going away, but I just don't think that if second life is promoting Durandran

231
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,720
and that's their big claim to fame, I don't want to be a part of it, as much as I'd like

232
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,560
Durandran, I don't want to be a part of 80s has been, I'm already enough of that,

233
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:50,400
thank you, so today is August the 14th, I don't know when you were listening to this

234
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,600
show, but it's actually one day after a pretty historical event for me personally, Adam,

235
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:02,400
I just want to send best wishes for August 13th, the anniversary of your first pod cast

236
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,200
two years ago, and thank you, my name's Len Edgerlee, I live in Denver, Colorado, and

237
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,200
even inspired me to try out pod casting, but mainly just to be a loyal member of your audience,

238
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:21,880
and what I think accounts for why you're a must listen to for me is you're open as an

239
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,640
honesty, you're consistency, incredible way that you keep doing this even through things

240
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,760
like the death of your mother, and you're always learning things, like playing around

241
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:38,160
a second life, so these are things I try to bring into my own experimentation with pod casting,

242
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:45,120
and you know, I think I'm either a culture or a skrunder, because I sort of fold the toilet

243
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,920
paper, but in a real loose way, so it's almost a skrunch, so I don't know, I've thought

244
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:55,560
about this, and it's amazing the things that David Sorsko gets me thinking about, including

245
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:02,320
that most intimate act, anyway, happy anniversary, a great day, and I hope you have lots

246
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
of celebration of it, thanks Bob.

247
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,240
Thank you so much, that's so kind of you.

248
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,000
I have, of course, you know, me and Adiversaries, I completely forgotten about it.

249
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,880
That was August 13, 2004, was indeed the first daily source code that had been doing

250
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:20,360
pod casts for several weeks, if not two months prior to that, although they weren't

251
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:27,040
really named as as such, I think it's so long ago, and of course, all those files of

252
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,440
lost, or they're sitting on a dot mac account somewhere.

253
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,120
Yeah, this whole scruncher folder debate is, is big.

254
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:39,960
It's amazing how every single person of all walks of life are interested in passing

255
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,600
on the information folder scruncher.

256
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,520
I think it's the mystery of it all.

257
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,520
It's why do you scrunch?

258
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
Why do you fold?

259
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,520
Is it something you brought up with?

260
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
Is it hereditary?

261
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,760
Does it say something about your personality?

262
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:54,360
I think in the next presidential elections, boxes of briefs, who cares, folder or scruncher

263
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
Mr. President?

264
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,360
Hey, Adam, this is Will, it's stranded in Cleveland.com, and I'm running a little bit

265
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:10,720
behind on the Charlie, and I was just listening to episode 415 on August 13, 2006, and

266
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:19,840
the affluent suburbs of Mayfield, Village, Ohio, near Cleveland, and the podcast, stranded

267
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,800
in Cleveland.com, not a plug there or anything.

268
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:29,320
Anyhow, I just wanted you to know, I just listened to you instructing everybody to plug

269
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:37,400
BSC into their cell phones and want to let you know that that is exactly what I did.

270
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,360
I stopped picked up my cell phone, put in DSC, and put in the number.

271
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,960
So now you're stuck with me even here in front of me.

272
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:53,080
Hey, love the show, and check out the stranded in Cleveland, and especially check out

273
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,080
my art.

274
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,080
Thanks, Norma.

275
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,080
All right, dude.

276
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
Thank you.

277
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,840
Probably about the same as Guilford sometimes.

278
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,000
So that's exactly what you should do, because, and I recommend you do this for any podcast

279
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,760
that has a phone number, because it's the perfect way to get in touch with the show that

280
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,040
you're listening to during your commute, if you commute, if you listen, whenever

281
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,840
you're listening away from your computer, program the name and the number of the show's

282
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,720
voicemail into your mobile cell phone.

283
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:27,720
For this show, it's plus one, two zero one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven,

284
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,960
or if you prefer it in the United Kingdom plus four, four, two, zero, seven, six, eight, one,

285
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,480
three, seven, five, three.

286
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,040
Hey, Adam, it's Kevin Crossman from the Frap Pack podcast at FrapPack.com.

287
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,880
Two questions, number one, what's this plus one thing with the phone number?

288
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,280
I've never heard that before.

289
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,320
Maybe that's a young versus Brits thing that you're picking up from, I'll living

290
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,920
over across the pond, I'd be interested in knowing, and then I'll go home, let's get to

291
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,920
that one first dude.

292
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,920
Okay.

293
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,920
Yeah, of course.

294
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,920
You're a young.

295
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,880
I'm a young too, but I'm a worldly young.

296
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,600
You see, the GSM protocol was developed specifically so you could roam around the world

297
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,720
and not have to enter in different country codes, as you may or may not know, in just

298
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,320
about every single country in the world except for the United States.

299
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:23,720
If you want to dial an international number, you dial zero zero and then the country code.

300
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,920
So that would be, if I was going to call the United States from anywhere but the United

301
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,120
States, it would be zero zero one and then the area code and then a number.

302
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,080
In the United States, if you wish to call overseas, you dial zero one one and then the

303
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
country code and the number.

304
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,600
So you see this is particularly when you travel between the US and anywhere else in the

305
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,240
world, it sucks because you want to have those numbers ready to go at the price of a

306
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,800
button, particularly if it's the daily source code number, right?

307
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:01,080
So a little trick, and this is a part of the GSM protocol, which is what we use on mobile

308
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:08,920
cell phones today, is to enter a plus, sometimes that's, you have to hit the zero key twice.

309
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:15,440
This plus basically tells the cell phone network, attention attention, standby for country

310
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,840
code.

311
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:24,640
So the US being one country code one and my number, my main number being a new jersey,

312
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,000
you do plus and then one and then the two zero one, sixty five, sixty five, seven.

313
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,920
So no matter where you are and it could happen that you travel outside of the US,

314
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,840
it will still work and you won't have to reprogram anything or re-enter the numbers or write

315
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,680
it down and then you know go back, it's just the way to go, enter a plus, it works a

316
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
universal.

317
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,600
Secondly, I want to leave you a folder scruncher, but I'm not really a folder, I'm not

318
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,600
really a scruncher.

319
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,080
It's sort of a folded scrunch, I don't know what to call that.

320
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:00,240
Anyway, if you have a term, I'd love to start using it, anyway, blow jobs, bye.

321
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,880
Oh, I feel so bad.

322
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,880
I feel so bad for the people who are listening to serious stars one or two right now.

323
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,360
I mean, in a way bad, because one way not bad, because of course, you still have three

324
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:19,800
and a half hours of fantastic pod show podcast coming at you on stars one or two.

325
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,400
I feel bad because you're not going to hear the folder scruncher song and another comment

326
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,160
about the big folder scruncher debate.

327
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,920
Inore will you hear brand new, deep purple, but if you go to dailysourcecode.com, you

328
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:36,360
can download the show, listen to the rest of it, or at the office, just go to dailysourcecode.com

329
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,400
and click on play it and it'll start playing for you right away.

330
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,400
On the way today, Scott Siggler, East Radio, CC Chapman, DVD weekly is coming up, Jersey

331
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,200
Todd Show, Don and Drew, right after Pacific Coast Hellway, which is next here on serious

332
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,320
stars one or two, I'll be back tomorrow with y'all take care and have a great day.

333
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,320
Okay.

334
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,920
So you're still here, which means you're in luck.

335
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:03,360
Hey Adam PD love from localsradio in thedadicast.com, so the folder scruncher debate.

336
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,040
Well, I admit I'm a scruncher, I know that distance me to be a surf in the folder lords

337
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,600
and bearings, but that's what I am.

338
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,040
When helping my kids clean their bottoms, I was a folder.

339
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:19,040
So with the phoning example, but daddy being a scruncher, what would they turn out to

340
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
be?

341
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,280
And I know you've talked about this being a hereditary thing before, so yes indeed, they

342
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,840
are scrunchers.

343
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,600
Perhaps folding is something that is just learned in kids, they don't get it because

344
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,840
they do scrunching because it's faster, I don't know, they're always in a hurry, so

345
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,400
that would explain it.

346
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,680
Frankly, I would just be happy if they stop missing the toilet, but anyway, by the way,

347
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:43,120
I just loaded up a new virtual mixtape on Lovehouse Radio episode 105 and episode 104

348
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,280
included a skit called Podsafe Idol.

349
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,520
Check it out and let me know how goofy you find it, because it's pretty goofy, but I

350
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,440
want to head and register Podsafe Idol.com on GoDaddy just in case it evolves in

351
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,440
anything.

352
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,440
Tell me what you think.

353
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,040
Anyway, enjoy your show every day and like I said, scruncher.

354
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Alright, dude.

355
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,120
I hope you used the Daily Source Code DS3 code upon checkout to get your domain name for

356
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:10,360
only $6.95 a pity love, a outstanding citizen of Podsafe Idol in the second life.

357
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,240
Okay, scruncher folder, I was waiting for this to happen.

358
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:21,200
I came kind of from an unexpected, unexpected direction, I thought it might have come from

359
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,440
Jeff Smith or from someone else, but no, Slaw.

360
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,720
Do we remember who Slaw is?

361
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,760
Slaw is big on the Podsafe music network.

362
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,160
He was instrumental in the Podsafe for peace song, which of course will start cranking

363
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,440
up in a couple of months and he sent me an intro to the song, which unfortunately got

364
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,560
hoesed out somehow on the transfer, but it was like the middle of the night.

365
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,920
He was just finishing up the song and he just decided to crash.

366
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:52,360
So I'll do the intro here, that this is Slaw, it's a parody, so it's kind of iffy as

367
00:26:52,360 --> 00:27:00,120
to how Podsafe it is, maybe under the guidelines of fair use, it's a parody anyway.

368
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,040
I present you the ultimate folder scruncher song.

369
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920

00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:56,720
quite a right amount of people over at pod show hold on let me just open up the open up the Skype chat

394
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:05,840
we had open all weekend Chris Rockwell Joseph Engo Jersey Joe X98 Mark and Steve David Gavin John

395
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,760
thank you guys so very much for giving up a lot of your freedom over the weekend so people who are

396
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,920
registered with pod show plus could have more freedom more functionality more speed more freedom

397
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,240
that I already said that but that's really what I felt like these guys worked their ass off over

398
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,320
the weekend and really really appreciate it okay it's unavoidable first of all the reason

399
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,960
my lady Patricia's not on the show today is because she's visiting the British Museum with her

400
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:41,280
sister you've on today in the city so no time for Charlie no we've got to go look at the crown

401
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:46,720
jewels I said baby I got crown jewels right here they weren't they weren't bling enough apparently

402
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,040
so we just cannot avoid talking about terrorism because I just wrote the topic lightly on Friday

403
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,720
and got plenty of responses via email and of course voicemail as well perfect place to

404
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:07,360
to let your voice be heard I was trying to be as um how should we put it as careful as possible

405
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:15,440
because senseo this senseo moment brought to you by the diva cast calm trying to be as careful as

406
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,120
possible because when you get into discussions about religion man if that's shit can just go on forever

407
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,480
you know and at the end of the day there's no real proof of any religion of a lot of the claims that are

408
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,400
made I don't think you know once in a while we might see you know Maria in a cheese sandwich but that's

409
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:40,320
about as close as it gets um of course you know my main point is that here we go again now

410
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,200
now we're we're down deep into all kinds of new security measures already on the BBC they were

411
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,840
reporting that the airlines in particular the budget airlines like Ryan air an easy jet we'll not be

412
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,120
able to bear this pressure these guys fly with one plane on their routes so you know if you

413
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,120
go to Amsterdam the minute you get off that plane new passengers are loaded on that

414
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:09,440
fucker flies right back and it does the same thing all day long the the air crew often don't even

415
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,640
get out to to go to the bathroom they just sit there and just so it's the minute you delay anything

416
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:21,360
by little bit it all it just has a complete domino effect and so it's very very difficult these

417
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,160
new security measures obviously we understand why they're being put in place but I got a lot of feedback

418
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:32,320
about my comments in general and also listen to this one hey Adam this is Bill Geltner

419
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:39,280
Austin Texas calling about daily source code 440 and your comments about terrorism I'll keep this

420
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:44,160
short I'm pretty sure you won't play this I'm not even sure you bet I want you to play it all

421
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:48,000
I won't do it don't call into the voice mail if you don't want me to play it okay

422
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:55,840
I just want to tell you I'm just speaking from the heart and speaking honestly from somebody

423
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:02,720
who's a American citizen who knows that there's a lot of lies lying out out there about 911

424
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:11,280
lies about terrorism a lies about Islamic fundamentalism you act like that you know everything

425
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,920
you're being told about these wild Arab Islamic fundamentalism deep all is is really what the

426
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:24,400
problem is and you're just totally incorrect you really need to read books again I explain it to you

427
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:29,840
nobody's gonna believe it you'd get into it deep enough to understand just how wrong things have gone

428
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:35,920
but you'll read David Ray Griffin's books they're freely available what's to

429
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,640
tire play and know there's lots conspiracy theory and know that a lot of it it's it's supposed to look

430
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:50,160
outrageous you you post it Alex Jen's video about 911 a long time ago when I can understand why

431
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:55,040
you don't want to touch a lot of it but for you personally if you don't talk about it at all on

432
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,560
your podcast for you personally you really need to get up speed and quit spouting this crazy

433
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:07,040
stuff you're spouting it it feeds the whole pair of things and the psychological operation

434
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:14,720
that it is so read books get get informed and stop spouting the nonsense that you're going with

435
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:21,520
that this is not Islamic fundamentalist here this stuff is trumped up it's manipulated in your right

436
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,280
it is it's the reason you rightly say that they make all these claims that they need to support

437
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:33,200
is because yes it is meant to instill fear in the population and it's a matter of social control

438
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,360
for things that the public won't go for unless they have these terror effect terror attacks so

439
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,800
thanks for letting me talk yo dude of course that's what the church has all about well you know

440
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,880
obviously in your short two minute and twelve second rant there you didn't prove you didn't prove anything

441
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:58,560
okay and thank you I do read books I've read plenty of the conspiracy theories I think the only

442
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,200
thing that I really said that was one hundred percent true that just about everyone in the world agrees

443
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,040
to is and I incorrectly attributed it to JFK of course it was FDR Roosevelt said the only thing

444
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,680
we have to fear is fear itself and right now that's exactly what's happening we're fearing we're just

445
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:22,000
fearing we're afraid so if that whoever intended to instill that fear that part was very successful

446
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,480
that's working however you know I live in the United Kingdom I work in the United States and when

447
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,080
I'm working there of course I'm you know I'm staying there and I'm an American citizen I feel

448
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:40,560
very safe I think it's one of the best countries in the world still nothing wrong with it I feel

449
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,160
free when I roam the streets you know there's a lot of pros and cons and all different

450
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,120
countries around the world and I still think the United States is a great country and if indeed

451
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:57,040
if indeed there's all kinds of bad forces at work well then I have belief in other American

452
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,520
citizens that they will actually come to task and they will take on whatever bad and evil powers

453
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:14,160
look out there excuse me terrible so if if it's the administration dude if it's bush start running

454
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:20,880
for president start getting into politics that is the American way absolutely the American way to go

455
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:27,200
we only have two years shit's heating up now you got a hurry for sure hey and this is Mike

456
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:33,200
Will's I have just listened to your latest daily source code here and people concerned about flying

457
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:40,560
and stuff you know what I'm kind of with you I'd hop on a plane and just go along with the flow

458
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:48,560
and the terrorists with them I'm bored you know I'd say FU and I won't have in you late and that's

459
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,560
what I'd say because you know what if it's my time to go it's my time to go and there's no

460
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:02,320
controlling over what happens but yeah it is kind of freaky but you know what you're like to say

461
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:08,480
it's a dangerous world there have been podcasts.com my podcast if you want to listen to some great

462
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:15,680
music and folder and scruncher thanks man absolutely no matter what I don't care if it's our own

463
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:23,200
government or if it's someone from some cave somewhere or whoever the hell it is you're not going

464
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,720
to scare me I'm getting on airplanes I am flying and I'll take I'll take whatever lumps I have

465
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:35,040
to even if that means flying naked. Hey Adam on today's DSC you made a comment about the next

466
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,000
time they'll find some guy with dynamite up his ass and we'll all be subjected to body cavity

467
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:47,200
searches so soon we'll have to fly naked that might not be a bad thing but we guess it is Adam

468
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,160
keep in mind when the rest of us fly we usually don't get to fly on a plane full of super

469
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,880
models like I guess you wow I know the last few times I flown I've seen people I don't want

470
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:07,760
to sit next to little ones they make it this is sac from the dirty jokes podcast keep safe yeah

471
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,680
what happened to good looking stewardesses I know you're supposed to call them flight attend

472
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,800
that's what happened to them at least virgin makes an effort you know they make they make all the

473
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,320
girls pin their hair up and and wear a nice little cute kind of old fashion like 50s uniforms

474
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:29,760
you know I wouldn't mind that you know why that's going to pay in for and I heard the support

475
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:36,960
on the NPR over the weekend in all things considered I'm going to play this report for you

476
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,040
because it really got me going and I want you to and you you may have no sympathy for me on this

477
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:48,240
but it really got me going I heard this and luckily the reporter says he's biased right up front

478
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:58,160
but have a listen I'll admit it up front on this story I'm biased I've been standing in

479
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:04,560
long security lines for years now watching first class passengers cut to the front first class

480
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:11,360
there's this class airline trust I don't mean the first class line at the ticket counter

481
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:16,160
and this isn't about the government's program for pre-screen flyers either but we're talking

482
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,520
about here are the special short lines leading up to security that are reserved for first class

483
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:28,000
passengers or even coach passengers who hold the airlines elite club cards I've been grumbling about

484
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,000
this for years mainly to myself like some kind of old crank but all of a sudden I've got company

485
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,480
that's outrageous everybody should be equal whether you first class or you're up

486
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:48,480
up of the coach in America's long airport security lines class resentments are simmering

487
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,280
they said let them in case I felt like with her lateria it was very frustrating

488
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:59,040
on Thursday Bridget Gargan waited in a line that snaked all the way back to the airport parking garage

489
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,080
and after two hours she missed her flight trying again on Friday she was ready to

490
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:10,000
storm the barricades you know what I think in in times like this we should all be in this together

491
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,400
and if it really is for the good of the country it was frustrating yesterday to wait two and

492
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,280
half hours in line to watch people because they had a little more money be able to walk through

493
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,880
first class flyer Ryan Schull hardly notices the indignation brewing in coach as he's

494
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,440
waved to the front of the line if you travel every week it's nice little benefit so

495
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,360
just see this a little bit of time you don't hear any grumbling from the poultry at

496
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:39,840
back there but just walk right by and don't listen to it and whom does Schull and the other

497
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:45,120
first class passengers have to thank for having their own line the airlines or the publicly run

498
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:50,400
airport as it turns out a little of both standing at a railing and looking down at the

499
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,880
rat maze of passengers waiting for security airport spokesman Bob Parker explains we may actually

500
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,760
control the shape of the line as the airport operator but if the airlines choose to have a

501
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,880
special line for a special category of their customer they can't Parker says many airports have

502
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,760
similar arrangements the airlines are tenants in a public facility but they're traditionally

503
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,520
allowed to arrange for special treatment for their best customers even in the airports public areas

504
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,520
it's really no different than buying the first class seat on the airplane at the front of the

505
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,600
airplane with your own restroom and a nicer meal and that explanation seems to satisfy a lot of

506
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:33,680
the people standing in line truth be told even as bad as things got on Thursday a lot of the people in

507
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:39,440
the economy class line shared the view of these gentlemen from Texas Herbert Hasket and Larry Lewis

508
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,560
I get they paid to give a to be for a class so she should stay to give for a class service

509
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:49,600
if I pay for the ticket I don't want to be the same thing yeah so things don't look too good for a

510
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:55,680
revolution in the departure lounge anytime soon they say we Americans don't resent rich people because

511
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,880
we're all brought up to believe we have a crack at having our own fortune someday could be the same

512
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:08,400
is true about flying first class they did Martin costume and PR news Seattle I'm aren't costume you should

513
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:17,840
be kissing my ass you should be licking it are you stupid this really got me so angry

514
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,320
I fly the equivalent of business class I could even fly first class if I wanted to but I

515
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:30,160
fly the equivalent of business class between London and San Francisco I fly this on virgin Atlantic

516
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,720
because I love their service and their flight attendants are I have cute outfits on

517
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:45,040
upper class is the equivalent of business class on British airways the price of a ticket is 12,000

518
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:53,040
dollars for a round trip be here me 12,000 dollars now why do I take this expense why does

519
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,640
pod show pay for this because when I get off the plane in San Francisco I drop my shit off at

520
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,440
the condo and I go straight to work why because I can I feel fit I'm rested I was able to do what

521
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,520
I wanted to do on the plane they've got fantastic movies I'm playing paying for all of that I don't

522
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:13,120
get a chance to go to movie theaters I didn't get a chance to go to movie theater and being paid for it

523
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:22,320
to see little man damn I should go see that anyway I pay for that I pay to be able to fly back on

524
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:28,240
a moment's notice and change my tickets I pay extra money for that and you know what that does Martin

525
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:36,960
that subsidizes every other class of travel below business it subsidizes the reason you can fly

526
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:49,440
for 50 bucks it's because I'm paying 12,000 proletarians fuck you the oh man just piss me off

527
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:57,920
and what is this look it's security you have to go security through security if there's a

528
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:04,160
shorter line you can pay for it fine this has nothing to do with we all have to be the same

529
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,800
we're all in this together you wouldn't be in the fucking excuse me I shouldn't say I shouldn't

530
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:16,000
use that word you wouldn't be in the line as many times as you are if I didn't subsidize your travel

531
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:23,840
and let me tell you airline bosses you better go talk to somebody because it's very look I know a lot

532
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:31,040
about aviation we're very very very very for you dangerously close to the point where it makes a

533
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:37,440
lot more sense for a private airline to fly two planes back and forth between New York and London or

534
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:45,200
London and San Francisco or to New York and San Francisco back and forth because for the same amount

535
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:53,680
of money you can fill up a plane with 20 people in a nice BBJ Boeing business jet and we have

536
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:59,200
great we have no freaking hassles with security you walk right through you check right in

537
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,840
your hop on the plane you're back and forth of course the flexibility may not be there

538
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:08,080
but the flexibility of not having to go through the airports is what's going to happen you're going to

539
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:15,920
lose you really are and when we don't when business traveler stop flying everything goes everything

540
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:21,920
stops dead in its tracks so you guys gotta go talk to whoever you talk to whenever you need some

541
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:29,760
you really do and please please stop with it just because they have a little bit more money they

542
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:35,440
don't need you would not be in the line most likely if I wasn't subsidizing your travel man

543
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,920
no just a personal thing you may think I'm a dick for going off about it but

544
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:49,600
man really got to me as promised uh want to wrap up put today's show with something new from
