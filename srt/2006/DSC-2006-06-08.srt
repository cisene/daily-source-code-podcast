Delta Sierra Charlie 401.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
A $16 billion worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Where is your boy tonight?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I hope he is a gentleman.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Maybe he won't find out what I know.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You were the last good thing about this part of town.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:06,000
When I wake up, I really need to take my chance.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Who about the game, if you hate him more than you know.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Is I love this for you?

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I should be there.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I should be there.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I should be there.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I should be there.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I should be there.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I should be there.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This morning I can stay for him.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Where is your boy tonight?

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I hope he is a gentleman.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Maybe he won't find out what I know.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You were the last good thing about this part of town.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Why are you upstairs?

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Why are you upstairs?

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why are you upstairs?

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why are you upstairs?

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:10,920
It's

34
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,920
That's my sin, and that's what I did, I can't drink for him

35
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,920
That's what I do, I can't drink for him

36
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,920
When we're so bored and I know it's a gentleman

37
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,920
And maybe we'll find out, I know

38
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,920
You wouldn't ask to be the bad fish for the town

39
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,920
You wouldn't ask to be the bad fish for the town

40
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,920
You wouldn't ask to be the bad fish for the town

41
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,920
You wouldn't ask to be the bad fish for the town

42
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,920
You wouldn't ask to be the bad fish for the town

43
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,920
You wouldn't ask to be the bad fish for the town

44
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:15,920
You wouldn't ask to be the bad fish for the town

45
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
Where is your body?

46
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,920
I hope he is a gentleman

47
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,920
Maybe we'll find out, I know

48
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,920
You wouldn't ask to be the bad fish for the town

49
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,920
Where is your body?

50
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,920
I hope he is a gentleman

51
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,920
Maybe we'll find out, I know

52
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,920
Oh, you wouldn't ask to be the bad fish for the town

53
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Grab that bottom, where is your body?

54
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,920
From the pod safe music network

55
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,920
And this is yet another one of those nexus that we've talked about

56
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,920
Followed boy, man, I think they have a record deal

57
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,920
Don't they? They've been around for ages

58
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,920
Now their music is playable on podcasts

59
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,920
I think this is really big

60
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,920
Another band that I'd heard of before

61
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,920
Panic at the disco, also uploaded yesterday to the pod safe music network

62
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
This is great

63
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,920
This is really cool, kudos to

64
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,920
I think Michael Butler persuaded them coerced

65
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,920
I don't know, Michael, how hard was it?

66
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Or was it easy?

67
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,920
I just want to step back and say that

68
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,920
It's not that I'm impressed that we have

69
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,920
Big names coming into the pod safe music network

70
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,920
What I'm impressed with is these are people who are already

71
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Definitely at a plateau, worldwide even

72
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,920
And they're seeing the advantage of getting your music played on podcasts

73
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,920
That's what's very, very exciting to me

74
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,920
Hey everybody, how you doing coming to you from the curry cottage is the daily source code

75
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,920
I want to be happy but I can't really be happy

76
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,920
Because the morning only about an hour and a half ago

77
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,920
We went to check out Patricia's palace

78
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,920
Her project

79
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,920
This is the house that we saw that if we could do the work that we wanted to do to it

80
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,920
Then it would be not only livable Patricia would turn it into a beautiful palace

81
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Now it is a listed home, grade two listed

82
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,920
Which means the council has put it on a list of important buildings

83
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,920
So there were a lot of changes and really one of the most important ones for me

84
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,920
Was raising all door frames by six inches

85
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,920
So I could actually actually walk through the house

86
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,920
And so we met the lady from the council there

87
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,920
And we had a list of maybe seven or eight items

88
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,920
None of the minor I have to admit

89
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,920
But right off the bat at the door

90
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,920
Non-starter

91
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,920
Honor you there

92
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,920
Honor

93
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
No, yes not

94
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Huh?

95
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
I'm trying to find hunt in case you had noticed

96
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:01,920
Yeah, so non-starter and it was interesting because the reason she gave this council

97
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,920
A woman from the, I don't know the council

98
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,920
The man it was a woman

99
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,920
Is that it would ruin the ratio of the doors versus the panels

100
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,920
And I said you're not talking about the golden ratio R she said yes exactly

101
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,920
I put in mouth of course

102
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,920
So you understand the importance of the ratio of the doorways versus the panels

103
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,920
And it just went downhill from there

104
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,920
Even the banister we went a lot to do anything to raise it to change it whatever

105
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,920
Patricia and I had pretty much agreed with each other

106
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,920
Even if one thing was off the list and quite honestly

107
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,920
I was prepared to accept the doorways

108
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,920
That's a really tough one in the UK to find doorways that are tall enough for

109
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
For me to walk through

110
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
I was prepared to accept that

111
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Although I said the alternative was of course

112
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,920
It's you know she could just get a different husband

113
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Yeah, I'm so thankful for the life and a hard podcast

114
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,920
And I just looked at the really social number 400

115
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,920
And discovered when you played the England song

116
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Wait a minute

117
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,920
We don't have any conversations

118
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,920
There are very many podcasts

119
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,920
Patriotic students for the sport that's alive

120
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,920
We need to have some more podcasts with which I use

121
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,920
You know you can't play R or C in the USA because that's all right

122
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
I don't know why

123
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,920
So we need to have more music that we can play on the podcast

124
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,920
Do the footage of life

125
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,920
It'd be really nice if you could help that

126
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Yeah, that's a good point

127
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,920
Although I'm sure if you looked you'd find a lot of patriotic stuff in there

128
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,920
If you find anything let me know about it

129
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
Send me an email at Maccurrey.com

130
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,920
So I can check it out

131
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,920
Because fourth July is upon us

132
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
It's going to be a very special day

133
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,920
A very special fourth of July this year

134
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
For a lot of people that I know

135
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,920
So myself included and some I don't know

136
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,920
40 50 people who are very close to me

137
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,920
That's all I'm going to say about it

138
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Hey Adam it's Jeff South and Nashville

139
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:14,920
Just calling I was just listening to your show from the 6th of June 6th

140
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
666

141
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:21,920
And I guess I'm one of those few people that actually enjoy it when life is not on the show

142
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,920
I've said to say

143
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Don't give me wrong

144
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
She's beautiful

145
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,920
I love her voice she's gorgeous

146
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,920
But I prefer listening to you take out on stuff

147
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,920
Talk about second life

148
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,920
That's something you're into

149
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
Talk about the computers

150
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,920
All the fucking problems they have

151
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
Because that's going on

152
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
Don't let her get you down

153
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,920
Don't let her tell you what not to talk about

154
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
Magnetic crap

155
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
Anyway

156
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
Just a

157
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
A little advice I guess

158
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,920
Somebody can do a listening to all the GP crap

159
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,920
All right

160
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
Thanks

161
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
Alright dude thanks

162
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,920
Yeah I love it when I hear from listeners

163
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
It's always a little harder when someone's a podcast

164
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,920
Because they have a set way of the way

165
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
They think a podcast should be

166
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,920
Or how it should be constructed or whatever

167
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,920
I love it when just just plain old listeners

168
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,920
Who are actually the top of my list

169
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Honestly

170
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,920
We got to voice mail phone lines for you to call into

171
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
If you're traveling in your car

172
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,920
You should just put it into your cell phone

173
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,920
You know just punch the number in now

174
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
You won't have to actually dial it

175
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,920
But just punch it in so you can program it into your address book

176
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
In Jersey

177
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
201

178
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,920
So it'll be plus one

179
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
201

180
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
6256357

181
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
And then we have a number in Europe in London

182
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Specifically

183
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
O2O

184
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,920
So it'll be plus four four two o

185
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
7681

186
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,920
3753

187
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Yeah man

188
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,920
Talking about you know

189
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,920
No, I just want to make it very clear

190
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,920
I have not migrated to the PC

191
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,920
See was this Ian Richards

192
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
Excuse me Ian Richards

193
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,920
Left a comment at curry.com

194
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Now let's see what he said here

195
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
Oh this was about the window blind

196
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
Yeah about customizing it to look like OSX

197
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
Yeah

198
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
Yeah

199
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,920
I must say another

200
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
minor

201
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,920
Advantage

202
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
Of at least

203
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,920
Not having a Mac power book

204
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,920
I can't speak to the new Mac books

205
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,920
But I had one of those aluminium ones

206
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,920
Or titanium or whatever the alloy is

207
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,920
And it was much harder to receive Wi-Fi signals

208
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,920
I noticed at the hotel that I stayed in last night

209
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,920
The night before in London

210
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,920
Of course apologies that we didn't have a show on Wednesday

211
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,920
But more about my day in a second

212
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,920
I noticed that

213
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,920
You can just pick up many more Wi-Fi signals

214
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,920
In fact I didn't have to use the cranky as

215
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Expensive hotel Wi-Fi

216
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,920
I'd jacked into someone's net gear

217
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,920
Point that was just apparently near by work perfectly

218
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
I was able to download a whole bunch of podcasts

219
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
And chill out in the room

220
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Of course

221
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
I don't know if you ever seen one of these

222
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
She reported Jay's very light

223
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
I mean 2.6 pounds

224
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,920
Now of course you have to carry an external CD drive

225
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,920
If you want to use it

226
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,920
But the sound that comes out of this machine

227
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
The actual speaker

228
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,920
It's like a

229
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
Like play school

230
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,920
It's really childishly stupidly

231
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Tenny and tiny

232
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
It's like okay

233
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,920
The people who use this laptop

234
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,920
They'll be using it for everything except audio

235
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
So let's just throw a little thing there

236
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,920
Like a little transistor radio speaker

237
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,920
And there's really really poor

238
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,920
But there's still advantages

239
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,920
Right now

240
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,920
As I said earlier

241
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,920
I'm getting so much

242
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Service off of the web

243
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,920
That I really don't need much more

244
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,920
Than a browser

245
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
And of course cast blasts

246
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,920
Which I was using already

247
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
Say Adam Curry

248
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,920
This is columnist

249
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
Who have been seen to your versions

250
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,920
About episode 10

251
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
I'm 16

252
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
From Essex

253
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
Just how to say that I love the show

254
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
And listen to it every morning

255
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
On why I take round

256
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
So keep up the good work

257
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,920
Thanks a lot

258
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,920
Bye

259
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,920
Yeah dude

260
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,920
Right now

261
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,920
So if you were listening since episode 10

262
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,920
Then you were listening when you were 14 or 15

263
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Because it's almost been 2 years

264
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
Krike

265
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,920
Continuing story about night sweats

266
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Which of course actually does believe in the

267
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Belong and the what is it

268
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,920
It belongs in this category

269
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:45,920
Right so the Metro sexual moment for those of you who are new to the program

270
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,920
Is intended entirely for water cooler talk

271
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,920
That guys just never really get around

272
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,920
To because we're too embarrassed

273
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,920
Or I just want to be a bunch of guys

274
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,920
We don't want to be seen as two feminine

275
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,920
You know stuff like that

276
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,920
So night sweats has been an ongoing topic

277
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
Night sweats is something that I suffered from

278
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
So nearly

279
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,920
Until a listener actually came up with a wonderful idea

280
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,920
And said why don't you wear boxer shorts

281
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,920
And why she said we shouldn't sleep naked

282
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,920
Not much for pajamas

283
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,920
So I wear the white beaters and the boxer shorts

284
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,920
Night sweats have almost completely stopped

285
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,920
I mean sometimes I wake up and I'm on the verge of being damp

286
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,920
If you know what I mean

287
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,920
But in general it works

288
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,920
Now I got an email from Freddy Avalos

289
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,920
And he sent in and I'll definitely put this link in the show notes

290
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
A link to the bed fan

291
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,920
Which I'm sure it would help tremendously

292
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,920
It's essentially a fan that is designed to blow air up out of the top

293
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,920
It's very thin you put it right in front of the bed

294
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,920
And the presumably you switch it on

295
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,920
And then cold air just blows from your feet

296
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,920
All the way up through the blankets

297
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,920
I don't know so far so good with the

298
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,920
With the clothing

299
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,920
And I'm not even sure why that works

300
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,920
Maybe the combination would be even better

301
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,920
But I don't feel hot like I thought I would

302
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,920
You know temperature wise course

303
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,920
So we continue to keep our eye on night sweats

304
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,920
Tragedy of tens of thousands

305
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,920
Yeah

306
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,920
Yesterday spent the entire day in London

307
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,920
And wow what a first all beautiful weather

308
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Could not ask for a more beautiful London day

309
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
And we have three guys in from San Francisco

310
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,920
We got moody mark and Chris

311
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,920
And they brought over codes and umbrella

312
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,920
And like man what's up with this

313
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
You know what I was going to rain

314
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
It's like dude that's I told you

315
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,920
It's a bad rap

316
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,920
He went has beautiful weather

317
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,920
Another fine example today

318
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,920
In fact it's going to get very hot soon

319
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
And as you know we're in the cottage

320
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,920
Which is a rental

321
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,920
And it has no air conditioning

322
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,920
So that means we'll be breaking out the

323
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,920
What is the name of that thing again?

324
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,920
Oh yeah

325
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
The con there

326
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
It's still in the corner from last summer

327
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,920
I figured I'd keep it nearby

328
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Just in case I needed

329
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,920
So it was just a fantastic day

330
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,920
And we spent most of the day meeting with producers

331
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,920
Creative people, writers, technical people

332
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,920
A couple people who I'd already met

333
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
And I was

334
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,920
Not just myself but

335
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,920
Mark and Moody and well as well

336
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
And we were doing most of these meetings

337
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,920
Just astounded

338
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
Flabbergast

339
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,920
Literally by the amount of creative talent

340
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
That we saw

341
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
And I'm presuming that there's much much more of it

342
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
And I'm not sure what it is

343
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,920
Maybe first of all there's not a lot of

344
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,920
A lot of television channels

345
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Really if you look at it

346
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
What people can receive here in the UK

347
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Maybe really only six

348
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,920
You know big TV channels

349
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Cable is not very prevalent

350
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,920
There's only I think 3 million cable subscribers

351
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
I believe I could be wrong

352
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
I think sky digital

353
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,920
There's 60 million people in the country

354
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,920
And I believe

355
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
Maybe only 8 or 9 million have

356
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,920
Have satellite television in the rest

357
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,920
Well

358
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,920
They get their BBC 1, 2 and 3

359
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,920
I think it's kind of it

360
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,920
I could be wrong

361
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,920
Correct me from wrong

362
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,920
So if you just do the math

363
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
And we know how many

364
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,920
What kind of great tools there are

365
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,920
On PCs

366
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,920
If it's an audio

367
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,920
It could be pro tools

368
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,920
Or audacity

369
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
If it's video

370
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
It could be Final Cut Pro

371
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
Or Premiere

372
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,920
Or Windows

373
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,920
And people have just been honing

374
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
The creative talent

375
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,920
But there hasn't really been an outlet

376
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,920
And so we're seeing this outpouring

377
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
And I saw pilots and demos

378
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,920
And ideas

379
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,920
And it's just completely blew me away

380
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,920
The level of quality

381
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,920
That is bubbling around

382
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,920
At least London where we were

383
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
I mean some people came from the north

384
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
By the way from as far as Manchester

385
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,920
Totally astounding

386
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
And then as we discussed this

387
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
We said wow you know

388
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
It's definitely

389
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
An example

390
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,920
We met two guys

391
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,920
I'm not going to say who any of these people

392
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,920
We're going to met with two guys

393
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
We met with two guys

394
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
Who came out from Bournemouth

395
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,920
They're in a college in school

396
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
University

397
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,920
Film school

398
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,920
And the ideas they had

399
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
And what they showed us

400
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,920
And what I've already seen

401
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
Of them

402
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
It is influenced by

403
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,920
I believe a much richer

404
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
Culture of

405
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
Media

406
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,920
And I think that's really where the

407
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
Difference lies

408
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
If you think about it

409
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,920
What are the kids

410
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
Today in the US

411
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,920
What do they grow up with

412
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Well

413
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
They've been growing up

414
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,920
15 to 20 years of prepackaged

415
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,920
Playlisted

416
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,920
Completely controlled

417
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
Crap

418
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
And so their influences

419
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,920
You know

420
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,920
Thank goodness for the internet

421
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,920
Because now they're being exposed

422
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
Other stuff

423
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,920
And I think that's one of the most important

424
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
And we have no art

425
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
School anymore in the States

426
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
Do we?

427
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,920
Is it even an hour a week

428
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,920
That's left of

429
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,920
Art Studies

430
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,920
I'm pretty sure that was on the outs

431
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,920
So

432
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,920
It's just

433
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,920
A blown away

434
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,920
And so

435
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,920
I came home

436
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,920
I was dead

437
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
Dead

438
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,920
Dead

439
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,920
Tired

440
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,920
Home around nine

441
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
And she looked at me

442
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,920
And she saw how tired it was

443
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,920
And I don't know if she could tell

444
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,920
What Muda was in

445
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,920
And she's like

446
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,920
Carefully says

447
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,920
How was your day

448
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,920
And I'm like

449
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
Wow

450
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
I'm just bold over

451
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
So many good ideas

452
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
So many talented people

453
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,920
It's going to be so incredibly exciting

454
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,920
And we're building a great team

455
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,920
For our UK office

456
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,920
One thing I did want to clear

457
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,920
Because everyone asked me this question

458
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
Is it going to be like

459
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,920
You put a different skin on

460
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
Podcast Ali

461
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,920
Or launch pod show

462
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,920
Plus with the UK flag

463
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,920
So the answer is yes and no

464
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
First of all

465
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,920
The folks we want to have

466
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,920
Working here in the UK

467
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,920
They got to be bright

468
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
Right

469
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,920
They have to understand

470
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Much more about the culture

471
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,920
Than any of us do

472
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Myself included

473
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,920
And of course it'll be for a worldwide audience

474
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
Obviously

475
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,920
But yeah

476
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,920
It's going to be its own entity

477
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Closely tied to the mothership

478
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,920
We'll have sales here

479
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,920
And when advertising

480
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,920
It certainly really only works

481
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
If

482
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,920
You know on a local or regional basis

483
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,920
Very few companies will buy

484
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Advertising from one source

485
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,920
In the United States and another country

486
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,920
That just rarely ever happens

487
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
So in all I'm just

488
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,920
I'm chaffed as we like to say over here

489
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,920
Really chaffed

490
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
Hey Adam

491
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,920
This is Doug Money

492
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,920
And one time chronicler of it

493
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,920
Hey Doug Money

494
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,920
You gotta tell you who he is

495
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,920
Doug was I think the first

496
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
He looked I think

497
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,920
Did he work for the register I believe

498
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,920
Hmm

499
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,920
I don't know

500
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,920
I think he was the first one to actually write

501
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,920
About podcasting on the internet

502
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,920
The first article

503
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,920
That actually got any traction

504
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
Before slash

505
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,920
I think then slash dot caught onto it after that

506
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,920
Adam

507
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,920
I'm kind of scared

508
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,920
I think I'm suffering from

509
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
Charlie withdrawal

510
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
Uh-huh

511
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,920
Let me describe this sentence for you

512
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
Okay

513
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,920
I've had listened to the Charlie and I know

514
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,920
The past five or six days

515
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,920
Over the past two nights

516
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,920
I've dreamed about you

517
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,920
On the first hearing

518
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,920
Uh-huh

519
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,920
I dreamed you were running around

520
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,920
Making these kids are like drop down and do push ups

521
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,920
Oh man

522
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
Wait man

523
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
I was running around naked

524
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,920
And I occasionally drop down and do push ups

525
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,920
Doug

526
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,920
This can lead nowhere good

527
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
I'm sure

528
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,920
On the second night last night

529
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,920
I

530
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,920
Dream that we were hanging out at the

531
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,920
Creeperop cottage

532
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,920
I know somewhere out in the woods

533
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,920
We're talking

534
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
It's Doug and me out in the woods at the

535
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
Crap cottage

536
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
Doing push ups naked

537
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
A bunch of people

538
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,920
You call me my brother

539
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,920
Oh yes, how it starts

540
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
Hey my brother

541
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,920
And then we'll move in from it

542
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,920
I don't understand what's going on there

543
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
Anyways

544
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
I have a good day

545
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,920
Charlie fixed him

546
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,920
Pretty quick

547
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,920
I don't know what to do

548
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,920
It's unstable on the road

549
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
And the problem

550
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,920
I don't have time to listen to the Charlie

551
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,920
Oh, maybe a cricket is in sale

552
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,920
No, tied me over

553
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,920
And it was

554
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,920
Tell you have to dream about you tomorrow

555
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,920
I have a really critical show up as well

556
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,920
Naked

557
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,920
Yeah exactly

558
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
Doctor

559
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
I'm a brother

560
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
Okay my brother

561
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,920
Watch where you swing that thing

562
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
You know, I think about it

563
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,920
You may be deprived of a Charlie tomorrow as well

564
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,920
Oh crap

565
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,920
I hadn't even figured that one out yet

566
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
I'm going to do

567
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,920
I have a meeting at a huge ad agency tomorrow

568
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,920
But they're in Canary Wurf

569
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Which is not convenient

570
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
From anywhere I think

571
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
But actually if anyone can tell me

572
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
What's the fastest

573
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,920
Or what tube do I take to get from

574
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,920
Waterloo Station to Canary Wurf

575
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,920
I really appreciate knowing that

576
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,920
So we have like a

577
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,920
A 10 30 or 11 AM meeting

578
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
So there's no way I'm going to be able to do a source code

579
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,920
Before that

580
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,920
We're going to be done around one

581
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Which will probably be too late for the satellite window

582
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,920
So we'll have to do something different on serious

583
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,920
But then when I get home

584
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,920
Then I promise we'll do a show

585
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
Patricia and I will both do a show together

586
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
For the Friday festivities

587
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,920
But it will be later than usual

588
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,920
And tonight I'm going to

589
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Engineer

590
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,920
And shut up because everyone's told me I shouldn't be

591
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
Giggling or laughing

592
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,920
Even though it's very hard to stop

593
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,920
What my daughter is doing her pod save the queen show

594
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,920
So she'll be doing that this evening

595
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
So that she'll have a show out on time

596
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
And that'll be episode number two

597
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
What else is it going to say?

598
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
Hold on

599
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,920
What do I have here?

600
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,920
Oh, this was about the fried nuts

601
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,920
About the, you know, of course

602
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
I don't really have the problem right now

603
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,920
Because the power book was getting so hot

604
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,920
When I left it on my lap

605
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,920
But they would fry my nuts

606
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Whether to Shiba is very, very cool

607
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,920
Unless of course using it to run second life

608
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,920
And then it's like full blast

609
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,920
This is from M. Josen

610
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
As a Windows

611
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,920
Since it meant I usually recommend IBM

612
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,920
Thinkpads to everyone now Lenovo

613
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
Which is what they're called now

614
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Still same quality

615
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,920
Over the years I've been using it myself

616
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
A lot in the same very stable

617
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
I carry mine around constantly

618
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
Wait a minute

619
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,920
What was the thing about the fried nuts?

620
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,920
Here it is

621
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,920
You also talked about your fried nuts

622
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,920
Well falling asleep

623
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,920
Trust me

624
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,920
I know how this feels

625
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,920
Yeah

626
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,920
Guys, we know what that's like

627
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,920
And there's a lawsuit waiting to happen right there

628
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,920
You know what I'm saying

629
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,920
And if you can get three million dollars for spilling

630
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,920
Hot

631
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,920
Coffee from McDonald's on your lap

632
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,920
We certainly should be able to get some dough out of frying

633
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,920
Our nuts with our laptops

634
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,920
Laptops tend to become very hot

635
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,920
Cooling is essential

636
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,920
Especially if you play games on them

637
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
Ooh, that would be second life

638
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,920
In your processor and video record

639
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,920
Really have to get to work

640
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
To prevent it

641
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,920
And this is a good one

642
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,920
I always have a thick newspaper at hand

643
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
It also relates great

644
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Keeps the airflow going smoothly

645
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,920
As it's not stuck to your trousers or anything

646
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
Also works great in bed

647
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,920
And you can find a thick newspaper everywhere

648
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,920
So no need of carrying around other solutions

649
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,920
Also think pads have a separate AC, DC, power converter

650
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,920
The adapter also becomes quite hot

651
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,920
But it's not built into the laptop itself

652
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,920
Like some other models

653
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,920
Yeah, that could be a part of it

654
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
But not with the Mac

655
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,920
Because it also has an external power supply

656
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,920
Good one

657
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,920
I like that

658
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,920
Well last night

659
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,920
I had to go back and just

660
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,920
I didn't even do email man

661
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,920
I just chilled

662
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,920
And we watched some big brother

663
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,920
Why?

664
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,920
You know what?

665
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,920
For those who listen to the podcast

666
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,920
Just stay tuned

667
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,920
We're going to continue with that story about big brother

668
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,920
If you're listening to serious stars

669
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,920
102 Pacific Coast Hellway is next

670
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,920
As the pod show line of continues

671
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,920
Wining up tonight with a new digital

672
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,920
Flotsom and Michael Butler, Cedar Maro

673
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,920
For the Friday festivities

674
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,920
So the Tourette sky

675
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,920
I really like him

676
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,920
And I think he has a strong chance of winning

677
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
This is kid in there

678
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
I think his name is Pete

679
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,920
And he has Tourette's

680
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,920
And being a mild sufferer myself

681
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,920
I can really recognize some of the agony

682
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
He's going through

683
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,920
But his best take if you will

684
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,920
He just keeps saying

685
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,920
Wanker

686
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
And a wanker

687
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,920
You can almost hear everyone in London

688
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,920
Replicating him now

689
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
But he's really really sweet

690
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,920
And quite intelligent from what I even saw last night

691
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
But something

692
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
I don't know if I missed this

693
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
But two of the kids in there

694
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
We're talking

695
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
Well first I didn't

696
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,920
I called Christina

697
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,920
Because I said what is this

698
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,920
And then we're speaking Welsh

699
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
And I'd never heard about it

700
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,920
Although I

701
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,920
Spoken to people in the past

702
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,920
You say that Welsh is really making

703
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,920
Resurgence, it's coming back

704
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,920
People are starting to speak it again

705
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,920
And it was the most funky language

706
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
It was almost like

707
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,920
It was like listening to the

708
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
Clingon

709
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
That's what it was

710
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,920
I could neither make heads

711
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,920
No tails of it

712
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,920
I'd be like

713
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,920
I can't go back

714
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
Schoolboy

715
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,920
I hate me

716
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,920
It was funky man

717
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
Hey Adam

718
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
It's Jamie here

719
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,920
Long time this to see

720
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,920
Source Coast

721
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,920
I must have just been listening to

722
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
Source Coast

723
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,920
400

724
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
And I've got to say

725
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,920
You're Welsh accent

726
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
Cracks me up

727
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,920
I was listening to you

728
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
I'm trying

729
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,920
Some of that from water

730
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,920
And people were just staring at me

731
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,920
And just thinking that I was having

732
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,920
Sort of problems

733
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,920
Please if you get it out

734
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
But I'm just by the end

735
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,920
Could it just it

736
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,920
I'm the only gain of it

737
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,920
It's Welsh

738
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
Is that Welsh?

739
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,920
Welsh accent I've ever heard

740
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
Really?

741
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
I can't wait

742
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,920
I'm the only gain of it

743
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,920
You know

744
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,920
I'm the only gain of cottage

745
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,920
David

746
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,920
That's Welsh

747
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,920
It sounded a lot different

748
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
I'm big brother

749
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,920
Yes of it

750
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
Tell you that

751
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
About this whole Mac window

752
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,920
By the way

753
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920
I'm not

754
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
Frank Barnico

755
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
wrote a piece

756
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
He writes for CBS

757
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
Marka Watch

758
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
I think he wrote it on his own

759
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920
Blog saying

760
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,920
It was actually quoted me correctly

761
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
Which I appreciated

762
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
You said

763
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,920
I'd said I hated being a

764
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,920
Propetual data tester for Apple

765
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
Which I have been

766
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,920
You test the machine

767
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
You find the bugs

768
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
The next one comes out

769
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,920
While you only have yours

770
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,920
For six months

771
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
And presto

772
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,920
Those problems are fixed

773
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
It's probably the same with any

774
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,920
Line of hardware

775
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,920
You know

776
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
I'm not trying to kid myself here

777
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
But I'm just a consumer

778
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,920
I'm just a guy who just needs functionality

779
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,920
And I just have no time to deal with

780
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,920
Going to the genius bar

781
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,920
It's just for anything

782
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,920
You know

783
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,920
And if this to sheep or brakes

784
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,920
Well that's being repaired

785
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
I'll buy another one

786
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,920
Maybe that's just the endless loop

787
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,920
That we were caught in with

788
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,920
Stuff that we really really depend on

789
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,920
But it's not a Mac versus

790
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,920
We know it's thing

791
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
Not at all

792
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,920
I'm just very interested to see

793
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,920
There's less and less importance

794
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,920
On changing

795
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,920
Or on the operating system itself

796
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,920
Because there's so many web services

797
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,920
And that's another thing

798
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,920
Barnico got absolutely right

799
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,920
I used Google Calendar

800
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
I used Gmail

801
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,920
I'll use rightly

802
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
I don't have a beta account

803
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
But I'll use that

804
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
I know I will

805
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,920
I've been an open office user for a long time

806
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,920
I despise the amount of money

807
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,920
That's being charged for

808
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,920
The small, just really just for a small, small piece of the functionality

809
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,920
That I use of office or of word

810
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,920
Excel

811
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,920
Only to read stuff

812
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,920
I don't think I ever created an Excel sheet

813
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,920
On Google

814
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,920
Didn't they also release their Google spreadsheet

815
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,920
Big debate about that

816
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,920
Do you know that a lot of people use this spreadsheet

817
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,920
Just kind of to keep records

818
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,920
Just like they use it as a poorman's database

819
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,920
And by the way, Excel was a very powerful program

820
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,920
But I think that's going to be one of the uses for

821
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,920
Not for real number crunching perhaps

822
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
Or not initially

823
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,920
But just to store some shit like your record collection or whatever

824
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,920
Yeah, I'm pretty sure people will use that

825
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,920
So all these things are what we call web services

826
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,920
That is the web 2.0

827
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
My friends

828
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,920
That's it

829
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
It's coming true

830
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,920
It's not like we didn't know it

831
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,920
You know

832
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,920
And that's where

833
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,920
We'll do that in a dev cast more geeky crap like that

834
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,920
Just a consumer

835
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,920
They'll just try to figure it all out

836
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
Oh, this is

837
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,920
I received an email about this podcast

838
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,920
Which I'll tell you which you'll hear a promo for

839
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,920
And it was a very long email and very detailed

840
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,920
And I was like, oh man

841
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,920
They just sent me a promo one of these days

842
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,920
Because so much easier and so much more fun to hear

843
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Different Voice and low and behold, my prayer has been answered

844
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,920
Hey Adam, good afternoon

845
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,920
This is Tey Officer Robert Kern

846
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,920
The United States Navy

847
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,920
Currently stationed at the Command Navy Reserve Forces

848
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,920
Command Office in New Orleans, Louisiana

849
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,920
And I'm proud to announce the launch of the official podcast

850
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,920
Of the Navy Reserve Force

851
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,920
This is the first podcast of the Navy Reserve Force

852
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:45,920
And it can be found at navyreserve.navy.mil

853
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,920
And I had to say

854
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,920
That the Charlie was inspirational in the development of this

855
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,920
Again, my name is Putty Officer Robert Kern

856
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,920
And my personal podcast can be found at RobCastin.com

857
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,920
But that's not important right now

858
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,920
We're here to talk about the official podcast of the Navy Reserve Force

859
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,920
The United States Navy Reserve

860
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,920
Good luck as the show continues

861
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,920
And I hope to hurt you at DSC 400

862
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,920
Hope to hear you get a DSC 800

863
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
Take care

864
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,920
Anchors away man

865
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,920
Yeah, that you go anchors away

866
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,920
That's a good one

867
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
I guess I'm not allowed to say that

868
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,920
Not being a sailor man

869
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,920
Dude, very cool

870
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,920
Congratulations

871
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,920
I will check that one out

872
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,920
Over the weekend I'll put it on my list

873
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,920
I wonder how that works

874
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,920
Did you have to go through

875
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,920
You know all kinds of channels and get approval

876
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,920
Or was it just kind of like you just did it on the slide

877
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,920
Or was there some, as there's a missive

878
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,920
For better communication

879
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,920
And of course we'll find out what's in it

880
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,920
But congratulations

881
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,920
I'd love it when we get different types of programming and content

882
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,920
Yes, speaking of that

883
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,920
I've been telling you about this earthlink ad challenge

884
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,920
Where earthlink and pod show

885
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,920
I've decided to put our money where your mouth is

886
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,920
By enabling you to create the actual commercials

887
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,920
For the earthlink service

888
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,920
That's pretty interesting that

889
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,920
We're getting tons of submissions

890
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,920
But I'm also seeing a lot of podcasters

891
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,920
Submit stuff which I like too actually

892
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,920
It's very, it's no different

893
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,920
Listener, podcaster, podcaster listener

894
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,920
I guess it's all the same

895
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,920
But they have some experience

896
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,920
They have already have some experience

897
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,920
And have the tools and know where to upload stuff

898
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,920
And even it said

899
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,920
What was it?

900
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,920
Add challenge.podshow.com

901
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,920
I'll put a link in the show notes

902
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,920
Let's listen to it

903
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,920
I just pulled up a couple of submissions

904
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,920
Let's see what we have here

905
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:47,920
Whether you're just starting out

906
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,920
Or your season traveler

907
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,920
Let earthlink

908
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,920
Or your bridge

909
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,920
To the world of the internet

910
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,920
Like an old friend

911
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,920
That you can always depend on

912
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,920
And will always be there for you

913
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,920
Earthlink

914
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,920
Always

915
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,920
To the internet

916
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,920
Wow

917
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,920
We'd call that a positioning branding

918
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,920
Spot, I guess

919
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,920
You should re-cut that

920
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,920
But then use Doug Monies thing

921
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,920
You know

922
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,920
An old friend

923
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
Earthlink

924
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,920
It's like an old friend

925
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,920
Running around through the woods

926
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,920
At the cottage naked

927
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,920
Doing push outs

928
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,920
We're doing the earthly clues

929
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,920
That's right baby

930
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,920
Right on

931
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,920
Earthlink

932
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,920
Bombastic broadband

933
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,920
Delicious dialogue

934
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,920
That's your thing

935
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,920
Earthlink comes home to you

936
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,920
And brings it home to Mama

937
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,920
That's our assistant

938
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,920
That's what I'm talking about

939
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
In Earthlink

940
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,920
We'll help you out with all your internet needs

941
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,920
It's just good at Earthlink.com

942
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,920
Let them know that Papa sits in

943
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,920
Yeah

944
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,920
That's your baby

945
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,920
That's what I'm talking about

946
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,920
So that would be perfect

947
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,920
In combination with a website to go to

948
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,920
Was it Jay Donnelly did that from Mad Pod?

949
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,920
Very creative dude, love it

950
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
And you know it's a cool about it

951
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,920
That wasn't 30 seconds

952
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,920
It was like 44 seconds

953
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,920
You know that's fine

954
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,920
That's what's cool about this stuff

955
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,920
How many seconds you need

956
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,920
You know we'll make it in

957
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,920
It's long as it entertaining

958
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,920
We got plenty of time

959
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,920
Not a problem

960
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,920
So it can be like that

961
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,920
We can be

962
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Funny

963
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,920
Sad, esoteric, experiential

964
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
Whatever you want

965
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,920
Check it out at challenge.podshow.com

966
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,920
The prices are pretty big though

967
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,920
I think if you

968
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,920
I believe it's listed

969
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,920
Thousands of dollars that you can win with this

970
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,920
And of course really

971
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,920
Just the coolness of

972
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,920
Practically creating a commercial for

973
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,920
Relatively big company

974
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
You know that's

975
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,920
Screw it man

976
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,920
I'm going to get into this game

977
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,920
I'm going to do one

978
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,920
Troy Rutter from RutgersRamblings.com

979
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,920
Hey Adam just wanted to give a public thanks

980
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,920
Make and bury over at castblaster.com

981
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,920
For some great help in getting my

982
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,920
Mixer configured correctly for

983
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,920
Castblaster earlier in the week

984
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,920
They were very responsive

985
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,920
Replying several times throughout the day

986
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,920
Definitely a great experience

987
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,920
Now I'll have to do a figure out

988
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,920
Where the increased room noise came from

989
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,920
Well actually I started right after

990
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,920
The recycling guys came today

991
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,920
I was ready to go and they rolled up

992
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,920
And I figured out what

993
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
Wait until they were done

994
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,920
It happens

995
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,920
It could be compression or whatever

996
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,920
The type of microphone

997
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,920
I'm sure that the forums and

998
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,920
Indeed my can bury will help you out

999
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,920
We got a new module that I'm testing

1000
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,920
Now on castblaster which I really like

1001
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,920
And the idea was developed right here on the

1002
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,920
On the daily source code which

1003
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,920
Just makes me so happy

1004
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
Because it came through

1005
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,920
Forget who sent it

1006
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,920
Something about

1007
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,920
You know I'd still like my WordPress web

1008
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,920
Log to post my show

1009
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,920
And honestly I always cross post

1010
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,920
The daily source code to curry.com

1011
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,920
Which is not the official home

1012
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,920
You know daily source code.com

1013
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,920
Is the official place with the official feed

1014
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,920
etc

1015
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,920
But I always cross post it

1016
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,920
And it takes time you know

1017
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,920
Because you got a copy and paste

1018
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,920
And you know if you got different fields

1019
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,920
And then copy the link URL

1020
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,920
For the direct link to show

1021
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,920
And all that stuff

1022
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,920
And so I talked to Andrew Grumman

1023
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,920
And I said dude can we just do this like

1024
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,920
Castblaster just do it all in one

1025
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,920
And now I have like a million more ideas

1026
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,920
Because actually it worked

1027
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
When I post this show

1028
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,920
It automatically puts in the direct link to the show

1029
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,920
Link

1030
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,920
It puts it up on the podcast

1031
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,920
Lover network

1032
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,920
It shows up in pod show

1033
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,920
Plus with all the show notes

1034
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,920
Which you can't see yet

1035
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,920
But remember I talked about important dates

1036
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,920
Um

1037
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,920
You know then it cross post

1038
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,920
Post the entire thing

1039
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,920
Plus the entire thing

1040
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,920
The entire show notes

1041
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,920
Plus the the enclosure

1042
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,920
The podcast over to curry.com

1043
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,920
And I'm pretty sure that's just going to become a configurable module

1044
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,920
But I'm really really really dig in this

1045
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,920
Anything that saves me time is great

1046
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,920
Um you'll add them

1047
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,920
This is Johnny Kay calling

1048
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,920
Long time listener

1049
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
Johnny Kay

1050
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,920
Look I I've got a confession

1051
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,920
I I've got a confession

1052
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,920

1065
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,920
Charlie Ite's dot com

1066
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,920
I've bought us some sale

1067
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,920
I um

1068
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,920
I've got under second life

1069
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,920
I've um I've done I have

1070
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,920
I haven't listened to Christina's podcast

1071
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,920
And I've bought some some music from from the band that she played

1072
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,920
I've done everything you've asked

1073
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,920
But I just can't just can't switch to windows

1074
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,920
Don't make me

1075
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,920
Wait a minute

1076
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,920
First of all I don't think I've actually told you to buy anything

1077
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,920
Yeah the MM50 speakers in the eye dog

1078
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,920
I didn't tell you to buy a sense out

1079
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,920
I didn't ever tell you I don't think to buy a Mac

1080
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,920
In fact I've said quite the contrary if you want to run cast

1081
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,920
Blaster but I do appreciate it

1082
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,920
And I see this happening all over the place with podcasters

1083
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,920
You know if if a podcaster

1084
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,920
Um has something or like something

1085
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,920
And it shows then it actually works people go out and buy that

1086
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,920
Like a recommendation from the friend you know

1087
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,920
While you're running around the woods naked doing push ups

1088
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,920
Some back with all of us here in the apple world

1089
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,920
Once you're back

1090
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,920
So please don't make me do it

1091
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,920
Don't make me go do windows

1092
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,920
I'm not going to do it

1093
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,920
I'm not going to tell you I'm not

1094
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,920
I promise you I'm not going to do it

1095
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,920
No matter how much you talk about it

1096
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,920
Anyway thanks for the show

1097
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,920
You're hot ladies

1098
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,920
I hold on man

1099
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,920
Hold on to that dream my friend

1100
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,920
Just hold on to it

1101
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,920
What do we add right now?

1102
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,920
Oh perfect

1103
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,920
We're going to end up at our golden ratio time for today

1104
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,920
Oh by the way

1105
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,920
Charles Fleischer

1106
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,920
We're moving ahead with him

1107
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,920
We had a great phone meeting

1108
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,920
Phone call

1109
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,920
We got pod show LA involved

1110
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,920
And he's going to do a video podcast

1111
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,920
I think it'll blow you away

1112
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,920
All right

1113
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,920
I've played this girl before

1114
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,920
And she shows up

1115
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,920
With a new song

1116
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,920
And the pod save music network

1117
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,920
From the UK

1118
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,920
Kelly Mueller

1119
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,920
It's a gentleman

1120
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,920
My friend

1121
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,920
As we run around

1122
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,920
To the woods naked

1123
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,920
Doing push-up

1124
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,920
I've got my face

1125
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,920
To the sky again

1126
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,920
And I've got my small and full blue

1127
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,920
Housing ain't used to a different beat

1128
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,920
Now that all my thoughts are with you

1129
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,920
You give me such a fashion

1130
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,920
You make me feel like I'm perfect sure

1131
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,920
They can't keep on pushing me down

1132
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,920
But I've got the whole thing I'll never need you

1133
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,920
I'll take my keys

1134
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,920
Take my keys

1135
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,920
Take my keys

1136
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,920
I'll take my keys

1137
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,920
Take my keys

1138
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,920
I'll take my keys

1139
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,920
Take my keys

1140
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,920
I'll take my keys

1141
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,920
I could be all in no longer

1142
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,920
And I would be the richest I've ever known

1143
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,920
I've got my eyes wide open now

1144
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,920
And I've got my vision to clean

1145
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,920
Housing ain't used to a different light

1146
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,920
Now that you are right here

1147
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,920
You show me my potential

1148
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,920
You become such an essential

1149
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,920
Like the sun you throw my eyes in moves

1150
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,920
And it's something that I never ever want to do

1151
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,920
Take my keys

1152
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,920
Take my keys

1153
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,920
Take my keys

1154
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,920
Take my keys

1155
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,920
Take my keys

1156
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,920
I'll take my keys

1157
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,920
Take my keys

1158
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,920
I could be all in no longer

1159
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,920
And I would be the richest I've ever known

1160
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,920
Take my keys

1161
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,920
Take my keys

1162
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,920
Take my keys

1163
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,920
Take my keys

1164
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,920
Take my inkle

1165
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,920
I could live on them

1166
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,920
How long?

1167
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,920
I would be the richest

1168
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,920
I've ever known

1169
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,920
I've got my keys

1170
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,920
Take my keys

1171
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,920
Take my keys

1172
00:40:31,920 --> 00:41:01,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

1173
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:31,920
oh oh oh oh

1174
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:41,920
oh yes Kelly mur oh yeah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah oh oh oh oh I

1175
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:48,640
I mean, listen to this, it's so good, and it's becoming more apparent to me that we need

1176
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:54,880
a couple other positions filled in not just the Podsay for Renet, well, Podsay for Renet,

1177
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,080
but also in Pod casting in general, we need the internet version of publicist, you know,

1178
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:06,880
not the, you know, usually a publicist is a semi, I'm just, oh, I'm really generalizing here,

1179
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,760
okay, so don't get me wrong, but they're, you know, very connected, you know, hip

1180
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,800
happen in people, they got cell phones, you know, but that's for the old media, for the new media,

1181
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,840
it's, you know, the bloggers, they know the podcasters, they know, to really help, I mean,

1182
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:27,040
Kelly can't do everything by herself, I mean, look, she's, she's busy, you know, working with her

1183
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:32,560
blessed four and a half octave soul voice and using her weapons of choice, the piano and her songwriting

1184
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:38,720
skills. Now, so she's creative, she needs people around her to help her and we can do that now with the

1185
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:45,920
internet, and we probably need people to help manage their careers as well, you know, so it doesn't

1186
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,520
necessarily have to be, we can recreate a whole new version of show business, which will be a

1187
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:58,480
hell of a lot more fun, a lot richer and experience, and open anybody, you know, but we do need to

1188
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,120
fill a couple of those, a couple of those gigs. I think I can bring something, you know,

1189
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:08,560
who goes out and really actively promotes to all the podcasters, you know, not all bands are

1190
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,040
just capable, you know, look at some of your favorite singers and artists, they're not always

1191
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,840
capable of doing the business side or the promotional side, so there's definitely room for that.

1192
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,880
All right, that's stuff to think about. As I said, tomorrow we'll have the Friday of activities,

1193
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,720
lady Patricia will be on, it will be a little bit later than normal, but it'll be worse.

1194
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,560
Or 20 tailwinds, see you, bye. Another podshow podcast, stick it in your ear.

1195
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,840
Yet this podcast and we're great ones like it on the high performance podcast delivery network from

1196
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:50,720
Podshow and line-white networks. I love it.
