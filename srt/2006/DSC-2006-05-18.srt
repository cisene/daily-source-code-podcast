Delta Sierra Charlie 3 9 or 0.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,200
A $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,200
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,200
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,200
I'm a representative of her majesty's British government.

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,200
The Empire need you.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,200
What the question is, do I need the Empire?

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,100
Oh, you just can't mind?

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,100
I'll make it come and make you all awake.

13
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,100
My story might make you laugh.

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,100
I might make it come and make you laugh.

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,100
What a thing, dude.

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,100
I'm not a governor.

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,100
I'm a manager for you.

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,100
And I'm a paler from making a good thing.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,100
Dealing it out on your own.

20
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,620
Do you like it?

21
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,220
I want some more

22
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,500
I might not get it never before

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,180
I never wonder

24
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,780
You never stop

25
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,180
I never still never get too hard

26
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,380
I just don't know

27
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,460
I want my dead end to that

28
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,660
I'm on my bed

29
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,460
I'm on bed

30
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,700
I'm on bed every year

31
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,020
I'm on my dead end to that

32
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,300
I'm on my bed

33
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,340
I'm on bed every year

34
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,060
I'm on my

35
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,780
I don't want any

36
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,700
I lost it

37
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,060
I'm on my weapon

38
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,700
It's never a day

39
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,600
Oh I'm on my dead end to

40
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,140
I'm on my dead end

41
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,780
I'm on my death

42
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,020
I'm on my dead end

43
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,940
I'm on my dead end

44
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,460
I'm on my dead end

45
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,180
I'm on my dead

46
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:07,340
I'm on my dead end

YO

64
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:38,940
Q-GROAL

65
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,520
wah

66
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,880
DIGIN cock

67
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,580
hey

68
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,580
It's Thursday coming to you from Curry Cottage in the affluent suburb of Surrey.

69
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,580
It's Gilford where the sun is just cracking through.

70
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,580
It's been kind of a mixed weather day, sunshine rain.

71
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,580
You know what it's all like.

72
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,580
And I got lots to talk about today.

73
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,580
We're going to go a little bit longer than usual.

74
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,580
So probably actually the the satellite repairman.

75
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,580
P-Dub, he said, I'd like to have a 49er from you today.

76
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,580
That's our code for can you do a longer show?

77
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,580
So yeah, absolutely. Lots of stuff to talk about.

78
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:19,580
Some stuff that happened this morning with an interview that I did on the BBC,

79
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,580
for BBC Scotland. Got to tell you about that one.

80
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,580
And let's get this one out of the way right away.

81
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,580
Well, we're from our spine here.

82
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,580
It's the Yanks versus the Brits.

83
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:36,580
We'll drive each other crazy, but everybody knows that it's a parent to see.

84
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,580
They're just like you and me. It's the Yanks and the Brits.

85
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,580
The Yanks versus the Brits.

86
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,580
Mind the gap.

87
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,580
Very special episode of the or addition of the Yanks versus the Brits today.

88
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:57,580
I think that this is the guy who called in a couple weeks ago on the on the brand new voice mail phone lines,

89
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,580
which in New Jersey you're 2016256357 or in London,

90
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,580
02076813753.

91
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,580
And you might remember it. All that all he said was,

92
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,580
this is a test to test communications from Abu Dhabi.

93
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,580
And the guy's name is Malcolm.

94
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,580
And he sent in a segment for the Yanks versus the Brits and his voice.

95
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,580
It just blew me. He could he could be talking crap for all I care.

96
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,580
I'd still listen to what this guy has to say.

97
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,580
The Yanks versus the Brits is proving a great feature on the Johnny regularly,

98
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:32,580
making me smile when I remember the misunderstandings of my high school and college years in the states.

99
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,580
I think I'm beyond being phased by pronunciation issues.

100
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,580
When I write my spelling is British, I reckon my punctuation is probably America.

101
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:49,580
There is one area in which an American peculiarity in rages need mightily several times every single day.

102
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,580
This happens whenever I want to print out a document on my printer.

103
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:00,580
And I'm someone who takes pride in the way my correspondence and manuscripts look.

104
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,580
I try to lay them out in a way which pleases the eye.

105
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:14,580
But how often do I hit the print button and then realize that I've forgotten to override the default 8x10 and the half inch US letter format?

106
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,580
Most of the world uses internationally standardized stationery sciences.

107
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:25,580
A letter or a page of a script is most often A4, roughly 21x30 centimeters.

108
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,580
But a few printers I have been able to find offer A4 as the default format.

109
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,580
It remains only an option which has to be selected each and every time.

110
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,580
This may for many people seeing a trivial matter if the document can be read, what the hell?

111
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,580
But even if I can easily accept that you say tomato and I say tomato,

112
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,580
I like my margins, page breaks and blocks of type to look the way I want them to look.

113
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,580
And so I curse Mrs. Hulet and Packard with great regularity.

114
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:03,580
And thank the Lord that for at least an hour or so of the day I have the Charlie running in the background to keep me from taking all of this part of seriously.

115
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,580
The only problem is the Saturdays and Sundays without the SC.

116
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,580
Here in the United Arab Emirates these are office days.

117
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,580
High risk days.

118
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,580
Defenderation of HP printer entirely possible one of these fine days.

119
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,580
Well, that's my take on the youngsters with the bridge at them from Malcolm in Abu Dhabi.

120
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,580
Malcolm, thank you so much.

121
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,580
Peter Day from the BBC has nothing on you, my friend.

122
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,580
Listen to those pipes.

123
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,580
And I was thinking, I could pull so many great drops from that.

124
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,580
How much was it on Saturdays with the Charlie?

125
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,580
Man, can you get a microphone and download cast blaster cast blasts at our calm and just record some shit for me?

126
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,580
Just anything.

127
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,580
I love it.

128
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,580
It's a phenomenal.

129
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,580
Did you hear about this?

130
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,580
It's circulated the internet a little bit.

131
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,580
A mix up that happened at BBC's 24 hour news channel.

132
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,580
BBC, BBC world or BBC 24 BBC news, whatever the heck it is.

133
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,580
It's really, really funny.

134
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,580
I just love what happened.

135
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,580
I'm going to paraphrase the whole thing.

136
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,580
It's not really important who's who and who's what.

137
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:10,580
But apparently, they were looking for a guy, an IT expert, to discuss, what was it?

138
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:20,580
I think was the future of, oh yeah, this was surrounding the Apple records or Apple publishing for the Beatles music versus Apple computer.

139
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,580
And so they had an expert on.

140
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,580
You know, and then he was really participating about the, you know,

141
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,580
he was answering some questions and talking about the future of music online and what was going to happen to,

142
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,580
to broadcast and he was really going all out there.

143
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,580
Unfortunately, I didn't see the piece.

144
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,580
It'd be great if anyone recorded it or if there was a link somewhere online to see this interview.

145
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,580
What happened is, and I can see this still happening.

146
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:50,580
Well, at any broadcast facility, particularly a 24 hour news channel.

147
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,580
So there were a couple of people waiting in the lobby.

148
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,580
One of them was the, the guests for this interview, the, the IT journalist actually is,

149
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,580
what he is, Mr. Cuney with the K.

150
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,580
And there was another gentleman there, Mr. Goma, who was there for an interview,

151
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:11,580
but it was for a job interview to work at BBC News.

152
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,580
And so apparently, you know, and you know how this goes, like, hey, you know,

153
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,580
got to get the next guest and the producer runs out of the hallways, like,

154
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,580
yeah, who's he for the interview? Oh, yes, he, okay. And so the guy's like, all right.

155
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,580
And whatever the confusion was there, they got the wrong guy.

156
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,580
And they, and they rush him through the studio, they plop him in the chair,

157
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,580
they're live on air. And, you know, so the question start and this,

158
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,580
and it first the guy's like, you know, he's apparently he's kind of, you know,

159
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,580
bewildered, but then he gets into it.

160
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,580
And then he, as I said, he starts to pontificate about the future.

161
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,580
Meanwhile, the person who was supposed to be interviewed, the IT journalist,

162
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,580
they're watching some other dude on the screen with his name.

163
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,580
And now it's like, you know, everyone's upset and there's all kinds of,

164
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,580
you know, possible litigation because it's hurt this guy's reputation.

165
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,580
And this goma guy who's there for the job in a year's like, hey,

166
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,580
I'll be happy to come on your show again.

167
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,580
That's the next bird witness. Oh, fantastic.

168
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,580
Now this morning, right after I dropped Christina off at school,

169
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,580
I went to the BBC Southern Counties studio facilities,

170
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,580
which are at Guilford University, where they have an ISDN hookup,

171
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,580
so you can basically be connected to any BBC studio.

172
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,580
I guess around the world, it's kind of a dusty closet with some really old antiquated gear.

173
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,580
And, you know, the old, you know, those old senheiser head sets that we all

174
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,580
craved at one point because you could barely feel them on your ears,

175
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,580
which, of course, totally unsuitable for radio broadcasts.

176
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,580
And because, you know, there's immediate feedback leakage through these things,

177
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,580
because they sit so snugly on your ears, but don't close any sound off.

178
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,580
So that, you know, that kind of gear, old gray metal stuff.

179
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,580
So the interview was for BBC Scotland.

180
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,580
And it's for the midday show, they're hosted by a woman named Muriel Gray.

181
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:59,580
And although I've never heard her show that she's been in broadcasting for 20 years.

182
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,580
So she's been around.

183
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,580
So, you know, I, of course, at 930 exact right on the button,

184
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,580
you know, BBC Glasgow calling Hilfoden and all connects and, you know,

185
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,580
get the engineers and then they set up and add nice little preamble chat with Muriel.

186
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,580
And of course, it was, to be about podcasting, a pre-recorded segment.

187
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:20,580
So I guess she does like 10 minutes, 10 minutes, three guests in a half hour or something like that.

188
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,580
And it's, it's for air on the 29th.

189
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,580
And so I had a really nice little chat up front, which I'll tell you more about in a second.

190
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,580
And then the interview starts.

191
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:35,580
You know, within, within just a few seconds, I realized that we have fucked up.

192
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:41,580
We, we being myself, and also the PR marketing department of Podshow.

193
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:47,580
We presume the BBC does their homework and their research and, you know, these extremely well-funded organizations,

194
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:52,580
really know what they're talking about when they approach anything from a journalistic viewpoint.

195
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:58,580
Well, what I realized very quickly is that the only podcast Muriel had ever listened to was one to be exact,

196
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,580
mine, and that would be yesterday's show.

197
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:07,580
So I'm kicking myself, because yesterday, I just threw out a show there, which was very much, you know, two songs,

198
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,580
to talk about my day at BT, because everyone wanted to hear about that.

199
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,580
And no promo is or anything.

200
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:17,580
So I immediately kick myself for, you know, for the response she had, because of course,

201
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,580
I can understand where she said, well, really, it's just, you're talking about having a big Mac and,

202
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,580
top meeting some guy at BT, and I said, well, excuse me, first of all,

203
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,580
it was a wopper, second of all, it was the CEO of British Telecom, but she said it was boring,

204
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,580
and she thought, and it was, it was like, just mainstream.

205
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,580
The fact that I'm even going to charge advertisers money for it.

206
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:41,580
So I don't like to immediately go on the defensive, because I don't feel I have to defend,

207
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:47,580
podcasting at all, but I was really pissed off at myself for not making sure that, you know,

208
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,580
she's never heard of the tartan podcast.

209
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,580
You know, I mean, what a disservice to her listeners.

210
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:57,580
And I just could not really, I could not move her left or right to be honest,

211
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,580
and she was extremely arrogant about the position of mainstream media,

212
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,580
and professional, and that's all the people want to hear.

213
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:11,580
So I felt that personally, I did, I did my best, but I did poorly in the overall,

214
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,580
you know, the results that I got from this interview, I'm sure,

215
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,580
and they will send me a CD, so I'll be able to listen to it at home.

216
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:24,580
Although I'm pretty sure that maybe I can get it on sky on the satellite receiver system here.

217
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:30,580
And it's stupid, you know, we should have, we have to, we can't forget that people just don't do their homework.

218
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,580
And then just following on the gang's versus the bridge, she wound up the segment,

219
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,580
and this really is getting to me.

220
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:42,580
You know, there's not much you can say to me as a Brit that'll rub me the wrong way,

221
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,580
but I hear this all the time, and I don't like it.

222
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,580
So she winds up by saying, you know, final question,

223
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,580
can podcasting topple governments, and I thought for a second, I said,

224
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:58,580
well, you know, we're already seeing web logs bring down political people,

225
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,580
particularly in the United States, so yeah, of course it could.

226
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,580
She said, well, because you do something about Bush then, you know,

227
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,580
and that was the end of the interview, before I had a chance to actually say,

228
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,580
well, you know, maybe if you paid attention to your guy Blair,

229
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:14,580
and got his nose out of Bush's ass, maybe Bush would have some more attention to look at some stuff.

230
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,580
But this is very, very consistent with Brit saying to me, well, you know,

231
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,580
hopefully you could do something about George Bush.

232
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,580
Like you're fucking powerless, come on.

233
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:29,580
Get someone in your government who will speak up for what you're really saying.

234
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,580
It's not all that bad.

235
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,580
I mean, it hurt me, it really hurt me.

236
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:39,580
Now, so she says this mural grace says there's no difference between what you're doing and what we do,

237
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,580
we're more professional.

238
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:46,580
And I said, no, because there is a lot about the freedom of speech and expression,

239
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,580
which you don't have either based on.

240
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,580
Primarily time constraints, you can't say everything you want,

241
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,580
because you only have half an hour as an example,

242
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:58,580
or political reasons for your company, or your broadcast organizations,

243
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:04,580
or for legal reasons of commercialism, which would not be possible on the BBC.

244
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,580
All these different things.

245
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:12,580
And to give you a great example, Muriel, and I hope that you're listening.

246
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,580
I hope you listen to at least one more episode of the Daily Source Code.

247
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,580
Here's a fine example.

248
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:22,580
We were talking before the interview about something which you would never talk about on the air.

249
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,580
Now, you did not disclaim it to me as being off the record or not being able to talk about it.

250
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,580
So I'm going to tell my audience exactly what we discussed.

251
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,580
She said, and this is before we actually started taping,

252
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,580
and have you ever been to Scotland?

253
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,580
I said, no, but I finally had my aircraft here, and I can't wait,

254
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,580
because one of the guys at the field, Jason, who actually works in the towers from Scotland,

255
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,580
and we're going to go, and we're going to do a tour of Scotland, one of these days,

256
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,580
one of the weather's a little bit nicer.

257
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,580
And she said, well, what is this aircraft?

258
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,580
Is it like a John Travolta Boeing, or is it a sess nice?

259
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,580
I said, well, it's a little bit in between, more on the sessness side.

260
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,580
I said, you know, but I wouldn't mind having one of those Travolta 737s,

261
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,580
or I can park next to my house.

262
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,580
And then she starts laughing, she says, oh, yes, well, there you go.

263
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,580
It's the homosexual, Scientologist.

264
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,580
And I said, what are you talking about?

265
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,580
You're talking about Tom Cruise and talking about John Travolta.

266
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,580
Oh, no, no, John Travolta's gay too.

267
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,580
I said, what?

268
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,580
She said, oh, yeah, oh, definitely.

269
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,580
I said, well, you're really easy saying that.

270
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,580
I mean, what are you saying?

271
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,580
On what authority do you have this?

272
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,580
And she said, I have it on firsthand authority from a man who's had sex with John Travolta.

273
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,580
And so I'm like, whoa, this is a major scoop.

274
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,580
And then she said, okay, but now my producer is saying we have to stop this and we have to start the interview.

275
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,580
So there's the difference.

276
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,580
You have a producer who won't let you talk about something that I think I was actually really interested in that for a moment.

277
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,580
It's like, wow, I mean, this is a pretty big claim.

278
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,580
Not that I care.

279
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,580
Not that it makes any difference.

280
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,580
Not that I love John Travolta more or less for it.

281
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,580
But wow, you know, you're so flippin' to pass on that kind of news,

282
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,580
gossip or otherwise, but you're too pussy to put it on the air.

283
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,580
Now that would be a conversation to have.

284
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,580
God, I feel good when I do that.

285
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,580
I know the tin foil hat moment presented by the financial aid podcast.

286
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:13,580
Yeah, I mean, if you or anybody you know is considering trying to make a real life living on second life,

287
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:18,580
you should know that inflation in the second life world is devastatingly high.

288
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:24,580
In the last 45 days, according to second life's own website, there's been approximately 10% inflation in the currency.

289
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,580
That works out to 81% per year.

290
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,580
Check it out for yourself on the second life website.

291
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,580
Just go to secondlife.com, look under commerce, economic statistics.

292
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,580
What does this explosive inflation mean for you?

293
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,580
Well, if you're just playing the game where fun, it's actually a great thing,

294
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,580
because it means that one US dollar will buy them that much more currency in second life.

295
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:49,580
However, if you're looking to make a business out of it, it means that your second life dollars are depreciating rapidly every single day.

296
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:56,580
If you bought a dollars worth of linden currency today, in a year, you'd only be able to redeem that same amount of currency for 19 cents.

297
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,580
Definitely think carefully before making a real life business out of second life.

298
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:06,580
Now for your tin foil hat moment, wouldn't it be great if the US government had a page just like second life did detailing inflation?

299
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:11,580
They used you, but the government has taken away that information from the public as of March 26 of this year.

300
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:16,580
Some conspiracy theorists believe that the recent run-up in gold prices has less to do with oil,

301
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:22,580
and more to do with the US government running the printing presses at full speed to try and make up some of the deficit by printing more money.

302
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:27,580
Just like it takes more linden's second life dollars to buy a dollar with hyperinflation in the game,

303
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,580
it takes more dollars to buy a gold in first life.

304
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,580
This is Chris from the Financial Aid podcast with your tin foil hat moment.

305
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,580
Stop by for more at Financial Aid podcast.com.

306
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,580
Dude, Chris, thank you so much, man.

307
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,580
I love it when you send stuff.

308
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:47,580
If Chris does the perfect type of, has perfect contributions to the Charlie, he really does.

309
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:52,580
He gives you some information, something that you wouldn't know about, and then he plugs us on shirt when he's out.

310
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,580
And that's, I love it that way. It's fantastic. Thank you.

311
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,580
For those of you who don't understand what he was talking about when he's talking about second life.

312
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:05,580
For those of you in Scotland hosting a radio show on the BBC, your first man may might be Muriel,

313
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,580
and your last name would rhyme with John Travolta, his gay.

314
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:16,580
We're talking about the virtual world known as second life, which is garnering great interest from the BBC,

315
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:23,580
from Harvard University, from Creative Commons, now also about to host an event in second life.

316
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,580
And that is very interesting, Chris. I'm not liking that at all, this inflation thing.

317
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:34,580
But if second life is true to first life and they do have a lot of financial models set there,

318
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:41,580
how can we reverse that? How can we reverse the economics and reduce inflation?

319
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,580
Is there a Fed that we, is there an Allen Green Span, he's gone?

320
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:50,580
Can we get Allen Green Span as you available? Can we get him as the Fed for second life?

321
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,580
I'd like to know about it. And I'd like to say just a little bit more about second life.

322
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:59,580
Actually, let me play this comment for you, and then I'll give you my viewpoint on it.

323
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:05,580
I had a much of their caution in San Francisco, and I thought I'd give you a call because I heard you talking about second life,

324
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:12,580
and how you like it so much. Now, I'm in second life too, but I gotta tell you, it is an evil game.

325
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:18,580
Not just gaming is bad. You know, that's not bad, but second life is bad.

326
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,580
When you've been in it for a while, you'll start noticing that there are people who are married,

327
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,580
that are breaking up because of second life,

328
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:30,580
there are people who are becoming psychologically disturbed because of second life.

329
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:35,580
They take it too seriously. It's called second life.

330
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,580
And a lot of people, a lot of people are using it to try and replace their first life,

331
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:46,580
and you can't do that. And I know I've seen that happen with the ton of people

332
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,580
that are on my friends list there. It gets nuts.

333
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:57,580
So I thought I'd have to add my team San Francisco, and don't live your life on a computer.

334
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:02,580
Get up and take a walk once in a while. Trust me, you'll thank me for it one day.

335
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,580
Right. So here's what I want to say about this.

336
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:10,580
We're dealing with the next generation user interface right now.

337
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:17,580
The three most common ones we have in our lives are Windows XP at this moment.

338
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,580
Macintosh, of course, that's a much smaller percentage.

339
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,580
Very similar type of user interfaces.

340
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:28,580
And then there's Linux, which has KDE and all kinds of all folder-based hierarchical, hierarchical,

341
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,580
desktop systems, filing systems, really.

342
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:40,580
And second life is some powerful ass mojo, because it is, in my mind, I see it as an interface.

343
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,580
An interface which you can do, you have tremendous power over.

344
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:49,580
Really, you can do all kinds of amazing things, particularly if you want to do something collaborative.

345
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,580
To me, no different than fire.

346
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,580
Fire was invented. Fire is very powerful ass mojo.

347
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,580
You can draw your clothes to it. You can stay just a warm through the winter.

348
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,580
You can cook food on it, but you can also get your ass burnt to a crisp.

349
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,580
And that's the part that you're missing.

350
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:13,580
And I truly believe that the powerful mojo part of this is because we are so used to watching television screens.

351
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:20,580
And seeing little tiny figures in the box do stuff to actually have control over that.

352
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,580
The virtual reality, your brain parses that as reality.

353
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,580
And guess what? The people are actually having very human-like responses in reaction.

354
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:34,580
So it's definitely something that you have to be very, very careful with.

355
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:40,580
And for those of you who are adults, and of course second life, I think the only interesting part of second life is the main grid.

356
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,580
We're no teenagers or kids are allowed.

357
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:54,580
You know, now just for a second think about what your kids have been doing and what's been happening with their minds as they're playing grand theft auto or any other of the Murriad of Xbox 360 games.

358
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,580
Okay? Powerful mojo ladies and gentlemen.

359
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,580
Hello there, Mr. correct. Just a quick comment.

360
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:05,580
A bit of our second life and a bit of our second life and a bit of our second life.

361
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,580
And life is allowed to crap when you first start talking about it, but I've been on a bottle look.

362
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:15,580
I quite like it. And he's right. This thing about, you know, it's not real life, obviously.

363
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:21,580
But it's a, it adds that extra dimension because you know, I'm sort of the top of your castle.

364
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,580
There were a few of the people there. I thought, I should have been there.

365
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,580
Then I saw you sat down in a chair chilling out and thought, this is a bit weird.

366
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,580
I've just liked London on someone's roof and it did feel awkward.

367
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,580
So I didn't say anything to you.

368
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,580
And I just bugged off, I was somewhere else.

369
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:43,580
But not before, funny enough, a chat by the name of comic senior added me to his friends list.

370
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,580
You all guess as good as mine.

371
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,580
But anyway, I've got a great idea.

372
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,580
Now, I don't know if you can have an audio stream in the air in second life.

373
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,580
I presume not because I've not heard any.

374
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,580
But when you can, this is a brilliant opportunity for pod save music.

375
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,580
What about?

376
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,580
Now, you're talking about a pod save concerts.

377
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,580
Like the being in the same style as the BBC thing.

378
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,580
But what about pod save live music jams?

379
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,580
You could even have second life virtual bands,

380
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,580
where people sat down playing their instruments into the computer.

381
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,580
What do the users here?

382
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,580
And you can basically have a full band live jump without leaving the house.

383
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,580
Without paying any rehearsal fees or anything.

384
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,580
You could even make it.

385
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,580
So you have a virtual pod save music band.

386
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,580
Now, come on, let's go to the earth doing it.

387
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,580
Anyway, keep it up to see you later.

388
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,580
Yeah.

389
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,580
I was not funny about it in south of England.

390
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,580
Coops in the earth, where the young man live.

391
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,580
Oh, come to the north with a real man live.

392
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,580
You sound like that guy and you stenders.

393
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,580
What's the guy's name?

394
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,580
Who's the friend, the jailbird friend?

395
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,580
Up at the north.

396
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,580
We know how to drink.

397
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,580
Won't work.

398
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,580
Second life is only as good.

399
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,580
It's just an interface sitting on top of the internet.

400
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,580
So everything that can be done underneath can be done in second life.

401
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,580
Just in a very easy to manage collaborative fashion.

402
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,580
This is not really even possible today.

403
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:16,580
And in fact, a lot of this jamming and stuff is very overrated for second life.

404
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,580
You know, it's just an audio stream or a video stream.

405
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,580
And you can have some avatars coordinated, you know, bang and away.

406
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,580
It's great.

407
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,580
But I think, you know, maybe just have that as a visual.

408
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,580
But then you have an opportunity to go chat with the artist later.

409
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,580
That is what's going to be exciting.

410
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,580
I forgot what you said before that about second life.

411
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,580
Yeah.

412
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,580
Okay.

413
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,580
Powerful stuff.

414
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,580
But in fact, the linden corporation should actually have a disclaimer when you log in.

415
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,580
They really should.

416
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,580
They should be smart about that.

417
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,580
Just put the disclaimer up now because it's true.

418
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:52,580
And I'd love to hear from any of the psychologists or doctors who work with the

419
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,580
brain and with the human mind.

420
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,580
If you could weigh in on this topic, because I think it's it's totally dangerous.

421
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,580
If not, if not handled with care by professionals, dammit.

422
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,580
And please don't send in the comment that says, yeah, everyone's getting sucked in.

423
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,580
I just, I'd like to hear from a real from a scientific perspective if possible at all.

424
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,580
Hey, we got to take a short break for the sad light folks.

425
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,580
As I said, we're doing a 49er today.

426
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:21,580
So you'll hear some commercials, which serious is lined up for you.

427
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,580
And shoot.

428
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,580
We'll do something else.

429
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,580
Do you believe anything is possible?

430
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,580
We do.

431
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,580
Where are flink?

Sponsored by Earthlink.

445
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,580
I got a big sense of standing by.

446
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,580
Hey Adam, Neil here from the pod safe revolution podcast.

447
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,580
You know, show that I've really become addicted to lately.

448
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,580
Apart from the Charlie, of course, is Steve runner in his

449
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,580
for depudations.

450
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,580
I thought I'd let you know that I made the 28th.

451
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:20,580
I'll be running in the ING National Capital Marathon in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

452
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:25,580
And over the last 20 weeks, running more than 1,000 kilometers in training.

453
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,580
I've really become sick and tired of the music on my iPod.

454
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,580
So I had an idea.

455
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,580
To do my show, I've created what I'd like to call the open source playlist.

456
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:39,580
And the goal of this, of course, is to create the first truly pod safe music marathon.

457
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:47,580
That's 26.2 miles, 42 kilometers, or roughly 3 hours and 20 minutes of amazing pod safe music.

458
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,580
So what do you do?

459
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,580
Email us at the show.

460
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,580
PodsafeRevolution.com with any artist bands or songs.

461
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,580
Of course, that are pod safe that you think I would like to hear while I run.

462
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,580
Words of encouragement are encouraged.

463
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,580
So, you know, maybe some words of wisdom from the Lady Patricia around

464
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:11,580
Mile 23, or maybe even Adam Curry Cowbell Remix of his favorite pod safe song around

465
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,580
Mile 24.

466
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,580
Oh, man.

467
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:18,580
Wouldn't it be great if you had Patricia in your ear buds and she'll describe it that she's

468
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,580
OK, I'm touching the guys now.

469
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,580
I'm motivating you.

470
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,580
Wouldn't that be cool?

471
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,580
Anything like that.

472
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,580
Just talk to her about that tomorrow.

473
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:29,580
For an example, the first song that was added to the playlist this week was Black

474
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,580
Labs learned to crawl.

475
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,580
Anything in that vein, anything that you think would help you get through a marathon

476
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,580
yourself.

477
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,580

481
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,580
Thanks, Adam.

482
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,580
Cheers, man.

483
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,580
Yeah, great idea.

484
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,580
And I'm going to have Richard Brewer hey from Pod Show.

485
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,580
Give you a call because we started a running channel.

486
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,580
And we got a lot of the same ideas.

487
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,580
It would be great if we could work together like the very much.

488
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,580
Yes, dear.

489
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:07,580
I will leave with my mom now and go shopping a little bit.

490
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,580
Okay.

491
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:14,580
I wasn't allowed to go earlier because she said I had to do my bed first.

492
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,580
Yeah, to make it your mom made you make up your bed first.

493
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,580
I couldn't leave the house.

494
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,580
57 years old.

495
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,580
She's telling me what to do.

496
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,580
Right.

497
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,580
And your dad standing behind her with a fucking power tool.

498
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,580
Yeah.

499
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,580
Make your bed.

500
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,580
Can you imagine I'm sweating?

501
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,580
No, no, you're perspiring.

502
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,580
You don't sweat, my dear.

503
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,580
She said, I said, mom, let's go.

504
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,580
I'm going to call taxi.

505
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,580
No, you didn't do your bed.

506
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,580
Yeah, that's good.

507
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,580
Hey, so tomorrow will you come on the show?

508
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,580
Yeah, okay.

509
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,580
And then I want to talk about the Eurovision song contest.

510
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,580
All right.

511
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,580
I want to talk about Paul McCartney.

512
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,580
All right.

513
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:50,580
And I don't want to talk about your breasts as usual.

514
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,580
If you don't mind, that'd be okay.

515
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,580
All right.

516
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,580
All righty.

517
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,580
Are you leaving now?

518
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,580
You're calling the cabinet.

519
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,580
See you later.

520
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,580
Bye.

521
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,580
Adios.

522
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,580
Muchachas.

523
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,580
Bye-bye.

524
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,580
Hi, Adam.

525
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:08,580
This is Jen from bucketpodcast.com or Madison Carnell and Second Life.

526
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,580
One of the call to tell you that I met you in Second Life last night.

527
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:18,580
And I told you that I've left you a voicemail from work, which I did.

528
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:24,580
And Adam, your reaction was not to say that school or great to hear from you.

529
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:28,580
Your exact quote was, was it naughty?

530
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:33,580
So Adam, a promise I would call you and leave you a naughty voice no message.

531
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,580
And I guess it's going to have to wait for another time.

532
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,580
I just had to tell you.

533
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,580
Was it naughty?

534
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,580
Seriously.

535
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,580
Did you have anything else, man?

536
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,580
And I'll leave you the naughty one later.

537
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,580
Bye, Adam.

538
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,580
Jen.

539
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,580
Listen.

540
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,580
I'll tell you why.

541
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,580
And you know, because I come up onto the roof of the castle in the virtual world

542
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:59,580
known as Second Life, which I call a very powerful Asmojo user interface.

543
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,580
And you know, you say it's Jen.

544
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,580
And I heard your comment.

545
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,580
And you know what?

546
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,580
It was boring because you call up.

547
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,580
You say, hi, I'm calling you from the office.

548
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,580
And you just go on.

549
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,580
All you do is you plug your show.

550
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,580
You know, do something fun or entertaining.

551
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,580
You know, just do something different, except hey, it's great.

552
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,580
I'm here in your show and here's a plug from my show.

553
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,580
I'm not interested in that.

554
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,580
That's all.

555
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,580
I was just giving you some guidelines.

556
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,580
You could do something funny.

557
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,580
You could do anything that's just more entertaining.

558
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:29,580
I'm just going to use a suggestion because I thought you had a great voice for saying

559
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,580
naughty things.

560
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,580
Just have some fun.

561
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,580
That's all.

562
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,580
I apologize.

563
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,580
Don't take it out.

564
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,580
I'll be personally now.

565
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,580
Coming May 27th.

566
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:45,580
The Ed's Mixed Bag Podcast presents the country music marathon.

567
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,580
And just in time for the Memorial Day weekend, why not put the entire episode

568
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,580
on your iPod and let the folks at your barbecue here at.

569
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,580
Don't own an iPod?

570
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,580
No problem.

571
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,580
Burn it to a CDR.

572
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,580
Take it along.

573
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:06,580
12 of the best country pod safe music network artists will each perform one of their exciting songs.

574
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:11,580
No promos, no chitchat, three sets of four songs.

575
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,580
Back to back.

576
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:19,580
After each set, a brief bio from the PMN profile page and the artist's name and song title.

577
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,580
So join me your host Ed Ovet.

578
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:28,580
For a Memorial Day weekend filled with the sounds of a country song on Saturday, May 27th.

579
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,580
Download it at idzmixbag.com.

580
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,580
Thanks for listening.

581
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,580
I love the country music on the pod set music network.

582
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,580
In fact, a lot is happening with the most driving pleasure.

583
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,580
Drive at sensible speed.

584
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,580
Be courteous.

585
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,580
And obey traffic regulation.

586
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,580
It may save a life.

587
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,580
Possibly.

588
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,580
Get lots of great feedback.

589
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,580
And I really had no.

590
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,580
I've played a couple songs.

591
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,580
Particularly yesterday.

592
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,580
Yes, they kept cutie.

593
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,580
And getting some awesome feedback on it.

594
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,580
And when I say awesome, I'm talking about a hundred different emails.

595
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,580
Hey, Adam, I'm listening to Wednesday's Charlie.

596
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:14,580
And I know that you're playing a song by Death Cat for Cutie, which is a very, very, you know,

597
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,580
a popular band.

598
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,580
And so I'm a little surprised.

599
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,580
But the fact they're on the PMT and then I'm so just excited.

600
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,580
But the fact that labels are actually jumping on board now.

601
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,580
So I just artists and labels are putting artists.

602
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,580
I think I'd never find the pot to pot to take me to network on there.

603
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,580
I'm like, wow.

604
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,580
So this whole pod says thing man.

605
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,580
It's really working.

606
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,580
So you have to go right.

607
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,580
Right.

608
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,580
Yeah.

609
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,580
That's the work of CC Chapman and Michael Butler.

610
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,580
And of course, the smart record labels are on to this.

611
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,580
They're like, okay, we get it.

612
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,580
And they're doing it.

613
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,580
And it's a working.

614
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,580
And I said this morning to Christine.

615
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,580
And I said, you know, I got a lot of comments about this deathcat

616
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,580
for Cutie.

617
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,580
She says, yeah, that's great.

618
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,580
I've known them.

619
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,580
And she rattled off five more names.

620
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,580
I said, where?

621
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,580
Come on.

622
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,580
Man, I'll engineer it.

623
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,580
Let's do your podcast.

624
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,580
I'm so ready for it.

625
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,580
By the way, every single song that we play from the podcast,

626
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,580
music network on the daily source code.

627
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,580
We ramp up towards our full release.

628
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,580
We'll be made available for purchase free and clear MP3s.

629
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,580
No digital rights management.

630
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,580
It stays in your accounts.

631
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,580
So you can always go back and download it again.

632
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,580
You could copy it for a friend.

633
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,580
And of course, you'd hope that that friend would buy it if they liked it.

634
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,580
To support the artist.

635
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:27,580
99 cents of which 90 cents goes to the artist.

636
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,580
9 cents goes to the the processing company that does the transaction.

637
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,580
Potio takes nothing proud to help with the pod safe music revolution.

638
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,580
And it's really kicking some ass.

639
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,580
Hey, Adam.

640
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:43,580
This is Chris from the randomly wired podcast in beautiful El Paso, Texas.

641
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:50,580
I was listening to your Monday edition of DSC and heard your intro with the new release for

642
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,580
Bank of Jones.

643
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:57,580
And I thought that was pretty cool because I had just gotten in touch with Stephanie from their American

644
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,580
Record label.

645
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,580
And had just told her how it was Jones.

646
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:06,580
And for a new track on the pot safe music network because I had gotten some good response

647
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:13,580
from some friends here in El Paso and actually heard first day on Kaylee Q and just not

648
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,580
man, that's awesome.

649
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,580
I hope we put a new track out.

650
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:23,580
So I sent her an email and she responded with the new track online on the 12th of May.

651
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,580
So when I heard it on DSC, I just thought, man, that's so cool.

652
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,580
I just got in touch with the record label.

653
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:34,580
Ask them for a new track to be put on the pot safe music network and learn the whole

654
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,580
run your show on Monday.

655
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,580
I hear the song.

656
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,580
I love podcasting.

657
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,580
I love this.

658
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:45,720
Keep up the good work and if anybody else wants to check out my podcast, check us out at randomly

659
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,720
wired.logspot.com.

660
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,580
I have a good one and we'll talk to you soon.

661
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,580
And dude, don't think that didn't do it.

662
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,080
That's very possible.

663
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,580
You're called, made that happen.

664
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,580
Everyone should do that.

665
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:01,080
If you hear of a band that you love, you want to get them in.

666
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,080
If the record label needs to talk into.

667
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,980
If you need any help, contact CC Chapman or Michael Butler would be happy to hook you up

668
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,080
and do whatever it takes to get you in.

669
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,080
And I made a mistake that I want to apologize for.

670
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:18,080
I said, hey, this idea of best of Charlie's or the DSC rewind.

671
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:24,080
I like best of Charlie is maybe the best title to be run over the weekend.

672
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,080
So I said, hey, what a great idea.

673
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,080
And of course, there's now three people who have produced best of Charlie's.

674
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,080
And the mistake I made is I don't have any of the infrastructure in place to do what

675
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,080
I should do.

676
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,080
And that's put this on a different podcast feed.

677
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:41,080
Because when I put it into the regular DSC, a lot of people didn't like that.

678
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:48,080
So I'd like you to not create any more DSCs or best rewines or best of Charlie's.

679
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,080
Until we get the PDN up and running fully in the open.

680
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,080
Which only be, you know, it's coming.

681
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,080
It's coming very soon.

682
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,080
Because the wise had to start up a new WordPress blog and just become.

683
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,080
It becomes very complicated.

684
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,080
Whereas you can really just manage that thing.

685
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,080
You can have the best of feed.

686
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,080
And we could have three of them if you want.

687
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:12,080
And I also said it to the Jeff Smith.com who is so wonderful at always.

688
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,080
Always working on something to help me out in the show.

689
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,080
So once we do actually get it running, get ready to snip this out of the show.

690
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,080
So you can use it for your best of Charlie or your rewind.

691
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,080
Because Jeff, of course, has made jingle all about it.

692
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:32,080
That's why everyone gather around and head into a party.

693
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,080
Get your buzz and jam a man is the best.

694
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,080
On the Charlie talking to the best on the Charlie.

695
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,080
Yeah, that's the DSC.

696
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:44,080
That's the best on the Charlie with Adam Curry.

697
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,080
Come on, now's the best on the Charlie.

698
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,080
Better than the rest.

699
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,080
The best on the Charlie.

700
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,080
Come on, now hit, now come on.

701
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,080
I'm on that talking man here now.

702
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,080
Here now what you see.

703
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,080
Here now.

704
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,080
That's the best of the Charlie.

705
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,080
Best of the Charlie.

706
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,080
Best of the Charlie.

707
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,080
Charlie.

708
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,080
Hello.

709
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,080
Okay.

710
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,080
You could snip it out.

711
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,080
I left a little bit of white space before and after that.

712
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,080
Thank you very much, Jeff.

713
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,080
For those of you that sent me feedback and emails,

714
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,080
Gmail's about a virgins plea.com.

715
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,080
Yeah, it was a hoax.

716
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:24,080
If you go to the website now, if you're only just hearing that episode,

717
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,080
if you only just heard that episode of the Daily source code,

718
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,080
you know that it was a hoax.

719
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,080
Okay.

720
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,080
So I fell for it.

721
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,080
I thought it was pretty convincing.

722
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,080
It was done pretty well.

723
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,080
It was an experiment in viral marketing.

724
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,080
Okay.

725
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,080
It worked.

726
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,080
Hey, Adam.

727
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,080
This is Robert head.

728
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,080
Leave me a message.

729
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,080
You don't have to put this on the air in there or anything.

730
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,080
This isn't for.

731
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,080
I don't need to plug my show or anything.

732
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,080
That's always the wrong thing to say to me as you don't need to put it on the show.

733
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,080
You know it's going on the show when you say that.

734
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:59,080
Before my golden ticket that I heard a week or so go on the dead cast,

735
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,080
number three.

736
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,080
And I'm checking out the beta pod show site.

737
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,080
And it's great.

738
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:08,080
And I just want to leave a message and say thanks to all the folks at

739
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:14,080
Pod Show and Kevin and that other lovely lady that was on your last

740
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,080
Devcast show.

741
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,080
Oh, Aaron.

742
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,080
Looking forward to the next Devcast.

743
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,080
And I'm joining Pod Show.

744
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,080
All right.

745
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,080
Next one.

746
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,080
Bye.

747
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,080
Thank you.

748
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,080
And I believe we'll do another Devcast tonight as I got email from Andrew and Kevin

749
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,080
K.O.

750
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:34,080
K1 that the SDK, the software developers kit is now complete and ready.

751
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,080
So I think that's really good news.

752
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,080
Adam.

753
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
This is Tom from Michigan.

754
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,080
I'm a regular listener of the Charlie.

755
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,080
I just had to send you some feedback on this all this talk of Neural and

756
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,080
The Negligistic Programming lately.

757
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080
Mason, come on.

758
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,080
Mister, ego here.

759
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,080
So I'm quite familiar with NLP or Neural & Guistic Programming.

760
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,080
In fact, San SAU.

761
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,080
The San SAU on the burp is a textbook example of Neural & Guistic Programming and

762
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:02,080
it's worked on, well, let me just say conservatively, tens of thousands of

763
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,080
daily source code listeners hold on a minute, tens of thousands.

764
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,080
Me, you've got a great show in all.

765
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,080
But come on, even the pod father doesn't wield that kind of power.

766
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:19,080
I mean, no matter how far in, I stick my earbuds when I'm listening to your show.

767
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,080
I just don't see that. Oh, sense sale.

768
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,080
Oh, man.

769
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,080
I don't see.

770
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,080
You're supposed to stick it in your ear.

771
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,080
Not in your rear.

772
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,080
I'm sticking stick it in your ear.

773
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,080
I don't know, you know, I lost my transplant.

774
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,080
Anyways.

775
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,080
You know what, I think I made my point.

776
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,080
No.

777
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,080
Great work, man.

778
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,080
Great show.

779
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,080
Later.

780
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,080
I don't know what your point is, man.

781
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,080
Definitely 10.

782
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,080
Sticks in here.

783
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,080
Definitely.

784
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,080
Please, light a match.

785
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,080
Definitely 10s of thousands.

786
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,080
Hey, Adam, this is Thomas Carolina.

787
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,080
I just got to say, you got this in sale.

788
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,080
Think down to an art.

789
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,080
Now when you belt.

790
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,080
I think it's in sale and say it's in sale.

791
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,080
I look to see who belts.

792
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,080
So I guess the psychology things work and give up good show.

793
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,080
Thanks.

794
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,080
Yeah.

795
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,080
Not only is it working, but I'm investigating something very peculiar.

796
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:17,080
There was an advertising industry magazine that interviewed an advertising executive who claimed

797
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:26,080
claimed that it was his idea to come up with a sense say a burp neural linguistic programming.

798
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:35,080
And I've gotten a lot of email and we've actually reached out to this company a couple times and not getting any response.

799
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,080
And said, hey, what's the deal?

800
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,080
You know, if anything, you know that this is not paid.

801
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,080
It's my reputation at stake.

802
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,080
Me, Adam Curry's reputation.

803
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,080
I'm not getting paid to do this and say crap at all.

804
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:54,080
So those of you who keep emailing me about that and asking what's going on were working on it.

805
00:40:54,080 --> 00:41:02,080
I just, you know, I want to be a little journalistic about this because it could be that the person who wrote the article is just full of crap and made it up.

806
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,080
That's very possible.

807
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:11,080
I'm not put it past any any publication to, you know, it could be an honest mistake or an assumption or whatever, but it's certainly not true.

808
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,080
It could also be that someone is trying to claim that.

809
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,080
So we'll get you the bottom of it.

810
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,080
I promise you.

811
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,080
If not, I'm going to send a matchup.

812
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:33,080
I don't think he's done me any harm at all.

813
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,080
If anything, it's probably told me as few manners.

814
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,080
By for now, I'm not going to do this.

815
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,080
I don't think he's done me any harm at all.

816
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:47,080
If anything, it's probably told me as few manners.

817
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,080
It's fine for now.

818
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,080
Roger, it seems like you're catching up on all the old episodes.

819
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,080
Don't worry about it, man.

820
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,080
Don't want you not to respond to all that episode.

821
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,080
It's catch up.

822
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,080
Get current, William.

823
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:03,080
And comic strip blogger just briefly yesterday he, I mentioned,

824
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,080
who I played a piece from comic strip blogger.

825
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:12,080
He'd called up LBC London Radio Station and was mentioning my name and getting the host to talk about me.

826
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,080
And it was funny.

827
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:19,080
And I said, I'd pay him 500 second life Linden Dollars, which is the virtual currency use there, which is,

828
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:23,080
will probably be worth about 50 Linden Dollars by the end of the year.

829
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:28,080
According to Chris Ben from the Financial Aid podcast.

830
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:32,080
And I said, you know, I'll pay you every single time you mention my name on a show.

831
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,080
And here's his response, which you posted at curry.com.

832
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,080
He said, regarding your, I should do the voice.

833
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,080
Regarding your offer for $500,000.

834
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,080
No.

835
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,080
You know that you can't get me through money real or virtual.

836
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:48,080
I have a feeling, by the way, that CSB is independently wealthy, but I could be wrong.

837
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:54,080
However, if Brittany, that's my partner, my sexy girlfriend in the second life,

838
00:42:54,080 --> 00:43:02,080
if Brittany from second life would agree to do one hour naked dancing at the CSB labs for myself and other visitors watching pleasure

839
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,080
for each mention of Adam Curry on British radio, then I can go for that deal.

840
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,080
Ask Brittany if she agrees.

841
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,080
Let me know by email.

842
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,080
Dude, you are so off base, man.

843
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:15,080
Brittany will kick your ass just for seeing that dang.

844
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,080
Hello Adam Curry.

845
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,080
This is comic strip blogger's penis.

846
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:25,080
Yes, I also call the balls that hang out with me dudes.

847
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:30,080
The one on the left, I also call him Kurt Loder.

848
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,080
Because he is gray and wrinkly.

849
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:37,080
And the one on the right, I sometimes call Adam Curry.

850
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:42,080
And sometimes I just call him Bill, just for fun.

851
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:48,080
But anyway, Adam Curry, I hope someday that I can meet you in person.

852
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,080
And maybe I can kiss you.

853
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,080
Or you will kiss me.

854
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,080
Yes, yes, Adam Curry.

855
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,080
This is comic strip blogger's penis.

856
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,080
I'm afraid I have to go.

857
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,080
I think we thank too much coffee.

858
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,080
Bye bye.

859
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:10,080
The voice mail lines in New Jersey 201 6563 57 in London 020 76813753.

860
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,080
Derek J. Steen says yo Adam.

861
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,080
I'm hosting pod tea for cancer during May.

862
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,080
And I've got an audio comment about it for you.

863
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,080
I would love if you could play it on the DSC Jeff Smith made an awesome song for the event too.

864
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,080
I believe he even sang you an email about it.

865
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,080
Well, yes, he did.

866
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:30,080
In some letterly water, the search is gone out for the soldier's seat.

867
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:35,080
Is the world's biggest morning scene.

868
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,080
You have a cup with me.

869
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,080
Good morning.

870
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,080
Howdy Adam, this is Derek from Senior Australia.

I'm hosting the Ponte for cancer, which denies my inter the world's biggest morning tea.

872
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:51,080
And not for profit foundation, which raises money for the cancer council of Australia.

873
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:56,440
and cancer research of course is shared worldwide so this is an event that everyone

874
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:01,640

So this year we're going to get it again and it's going to be more worldwide because

Excellent. It's like full Collins man. Jeff Smith is so talented. I hate you.

889
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:28,680
Hey I'm totally in. So 8 a.m. Australian time would be last night 7 p.m. UK time. I think

890
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:33,720
you gotta give me more times. I can't figure it up on myself anymore. To wind it up for

891
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:38,120
today and remember tomorrow the lovely lady Patricia will be on the show. An email from

892
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:43,640
Michael Applant. I think it's Laplante or Laplante. Here from Windsor on Terry or Canada where I

893
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:48,200
listen to the Charlie every day will on the assembly line at Dameler Chrysler's Windsor assembly

894
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:54,040
plant. We've built minivans and Pacificas. I listen to DSC number 387 where you played another

895
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:58,360
tune by Canadian Danko Jones. Great job. They really deserve all the success that comes

896
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,400
their way. I've been listening to them for the past eight years. Anyway you ask your listeners

897
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,960
for more suggestions of pod save music to play. You may have heard of the band The Famous because

898
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,120
they're out of Sam Fran. I know you got a pad there. I first heard them on the Roots Rock

899
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,040
radio podcast which by the way was recently favorably reviewed and Rolling Stone magazine.

900
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:18,120
The tunes I'd recommend you play on the Charlie would be get you back lost or mid-white.

901
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,720
You can find these songs of the pod save music network. And it goes on to say I originally

902
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,240
purchased the CD Light Sweet Crewed on the iTunes Music Store and I've been playing it regularly.

903
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:29,240
I love it as I'm sure your listeners will do as well. Mike, thank you very much. I appreciate

904
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:35,000
actually I had put this song in my playlist for a future spin. And the reason why I

905
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,920
recognized immediately after I played this song a preview to before starting the show. It's the first

906
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,920
line of the lyrics.

907
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:23,880
It's now magic. It's just a fool. The developer here is just a ring toss away.

908
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:52,520
I'm a mid-white, I'm a mid-white, I'm a mid-white, I'm a mid-white, I'm a mid-white, I'm a mid-white,

909
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:59,080
I've never left high and get a senior world's wallet oversteer. What were anything

910
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,640
perr ustedes saying?

911
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:16,360
And it's going to take me home before ten o'clock. I will wash my face I'll never do my homework.

912
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:22,360
Can you call this fear mark? What will it sound so fairãƒª?

913
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:32,520
I was in lost, I met you at the boots just all you said to do Big Texas like what?

914
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:40,520
Seven stories tall? What did you expect?

915
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:56,520
Fill off the ride, home the midway Fill off the ride, home the midway

916
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:12,520
I nearly died, home the midway Fill off the ride, home the midway

917
