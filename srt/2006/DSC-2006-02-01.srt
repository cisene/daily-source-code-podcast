1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Delta Sierra Charley, 3, 2, 8.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Oh, yeah, sure. We're halfway through the week, but I got the feeling we're only just getting started.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yes, it's the daily source code coming to you from the Curry Cottage at Gilford Surrey.

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Back to the wall, back to the wall, back to the wall, back into the curry where I'm new training.

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We're still in like a snow, many miles traveled here, many, many more left to go.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And I guess I'm afraid of the things I've found.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No, no, but I won't be afraid to find stars flowing down.

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And I'm just far from the wall, back into the wall, back into the curry where I'm new.

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Back to the wall, back to the wall, back into the curry where I'm new.

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I just give it up, and take me proud of you, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And believe that when I'm done, I know I've been depressed.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You saw the rest, saw the rest, saw the rest, saw the rest, saw the rest, saw the rest, you saw the rest.

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You saw the rest, saw the rest, saw the rest, saw the rest, saw the rest, saw the rest, saw the rest.

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You saw the rest, saw the rest, saw the rest, saw the rest, saw the rest, saw the rest, saw the rest, saw the rest.

15
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Skimming like a stone, over the circumstance, before I know.

16
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I've moved across the mountain, my home got a half stone.

17
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And I'm just looking for my home, I'm just looking for my home.

18
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And I'm just looking for my home, I'm just looking for my home.

19
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And I'm just looking for my home, I'm just looking for my home.

20
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And I'm just looking for my home.

21
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm just looking for my home, I'm just looking for my home.

22
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Mike Erica, skimming across the water from the pod save music network music.potshow.com.

23
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

24
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's Wednesday.

25
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And here at the cottage it's kind of an overcast day.

26
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Tomorrow I will be leaving.

27
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's confirmed going to visit my mom staying overnight in Amsterdam, returning home Friday.

28
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So I don't know if I'm going to be able to do two episodes or if we'll have to skip one.

29
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We'll just have to see anyway.

30
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Feeling good today.

31
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Despite that there's just no sunshine in the air whatsoever.

32
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is your typical British weather, I think.

33
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If you're thinking of typical British because it really isn't usually it is blue skies and sunshine.

34
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But this is what they always take pictures of and always refer to.

35
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I watched actually this morning more problems.

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The easy net dedicated lining to the house was, I don't know, it was broken.

37
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It was, I was connected, but I was seeing 50, 60, sometimes 80% packet loss.

38
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And so that was, of course, rather irritating has been a long time since bandwidth was a problem.

39
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And then all of a sudden you're pushed into the harsh reality of, dude, bandwidth is a big deal.

40
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Luckily one message to support got him on the case and there was something wrong within their networks so they fixed all that.

41
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And watched the state of the union address after I got my bandwidth back.

42
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Pretty bland actually. It was everything that I guess I expected to hear.

43
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Boy, now that I've seen Commander in Chief, West Wing is one thing.

44
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But watching Commander in Chief, I think that's probably a little bit more realistic.

45
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Somehow I think it's a bit more realistic about, well, maybe not the problems per se.

46
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But for some reason, I felt like it was more a part of the, actually it was taking place in the White House and how things must be.

47
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And, you know, there's a reason why they call it the Commander in Chief for the CEO, the Chief Executive Officer.

48
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's very much like running a public company, actually.

49
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No sleep, always something going on in China, somewhere.

50
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Ooh, maybe that's why, yeah, that's why so many people are so pissed off at Google because we feel that our own civil liberties are being suppressed.

51
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And shouting at the government doesn't seem to change very much or doesn't seem to get the desired response.

52
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
By the way, you know, Anthony Robbins always says if, and I, and I have learned a lot from Anthony Robbins.

53
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If you keep doing the same thing, you're getting the same result.

54
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Maybe it's a try time to try something different, you know, a different approach.

55
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
We'll probably yield in a different result.

56
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But Google certainly, they got there, their slams, not for the China thing, but.

57
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And after our trading after they miss their projected earnings by like a mile in Wall Street terms.

58
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And after our trading, I think the stock was down 15%.

59
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Now, Ron and I ran our last company as a public company for, I was at three years, three, four years.

60
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And it's really tough. You know, every single quarter, you have to, you know, bring all these, you have to really get everything all together to report and you're going to be judged by pennies.

61
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I mean, we literally want to miss one earnings statement by a penny.

62
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Of course, you know, when it's the difference between profitable by a penny or not, per share, it makes a big deal.

63
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But boy, did we get punished for that? We really learned the hard way about that stuff.

64
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You can only imagine. And really, it's not so much about what analysts do and what the stock price going down doesn't.

65
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's never really bothered me one way or the other because, you know, we're just growing a business.

66
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But what happens is, is when you have this euphoria.

67
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And of course, even though we went public in 96, we didn't sell until 99.

68
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
There was definitely a year and a half in there when, you know, it was bubble mania, even our stock just, I mean, we didn't enter in the bubble.

69
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We had, and we had real customers and real business model.

70
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But employees who were brought in within, you know, during the euphoric period are feeling really good.

71
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You know, when the stock goes up, 5% 10%, 15%, 20%, you know, then all of a sudden your options, which is, you know, really the secondary currency, certainly in the technology business, definitely in Silicon Valley.

72
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You know, you get it at the price that you enter when you enter the company, the current stock price.

73
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And so now those people are seeing, you know, maybe they had 100,000 or maybe a million dollars on paper, all of a sudden it's gone.

74
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Now let me tell you, there's nothing more, oops, that's the blackberry sorry.

75
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
There's nothing more demotivating for a company when that happens, you know, because there's always people walking around going shit.

76
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Look at that guy, you know, he got an earlier, so he's, he's made it.

77
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And it's funny the way human nature works that way.

78
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Even more interesting is that time Warner, the quote, old media guys, they reported a 21% increase in their profits.

79
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And I guess they exceeded the numbers that Wall Street was looking for from them.

80
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So just goes to show.

81
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Google still did 1.6 billion dollars or whatever, but you know, I think everyone got just a little bit ahead of themselves.

82
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Lots of feedback on this timer issue.

83
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I have discovered that keeping time on a PC is troublesome.

84
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And actually, I think, and Pete up came up with, well, he thinks the problem is.

85
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So the issue at hand is I'm running three countdown timers in total.

86
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And these are two of them are, one's based in Casplaster, one is based on countdown clock, a Windows application.

87
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And I'm running one called Shimu with double Oscar at the end on the Mac.

88
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And, and I'm just not, you know, I'm, I'm usually long by about 10 seconds on average.

89
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And I've tried everything, even these clocks amongst themselves differ in timing.

90
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So a couple of theories have come in and just some feedback in general.

91
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Ian says, Adam, in general computers make terrible clocks to co-figure.

92
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I work for a hardware manufacturer doing kernel support engineering.

93
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That's hot.

94
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,000
My user response to complaints about slow clocks is to install an NTP client or go to our goes for a Casio watch.

95
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Right, just for a little, a little quartz job.

96
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah, well, that obviously would do a hell of a lot better.

97
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
P.S. and Sayotip, well, warming it up, microwave half a mug of milk for 50 seconds.

98
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Makes a great latte with the Kenyan Brazil pods.

99
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah, I actually, I've noticed that, you should warm up that milk because, you know,

100
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
depending on how much you put in it.

101
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
If it's cold, it kind of neutralizes the heat from the sense say it when it's gone within a couple minutes.

102
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Dude, there's a fairly simple explanation says,

103
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Garan Hebert, Casplaster and Countdown Clock are both, are both right.

104
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
How could this be?

105
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Well, it's because they're using different clocks.

106
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Casplaster is using the sound cards clock and the countdown clock is using the computer system clock.

107
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Let's see, the problem is still, you know, when I deliver the file to P dub,

108
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
when I stop at 24 minutes and 30 seconds,

109
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
that's when the sound goes for the sound like window closing,

110
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
you know, it's still 10 to 15 seconds over time.

111
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So we have to look at it somewhere else.

112
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Sample rate is, is one area we could investigate.

113
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Andy Armstrong says it may not be the clock that's wrong.

114
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's possible that the recording sample rate is slightly out relative to the playback sample rate.

115
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I don't know.

116
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I don't think in a 24 and a half minute segment,

117
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
you can shift by 14 seconds based on some,

118
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't think sample rate is really going to be it.

119
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Here's what I think it is.

120
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
If you're basing all these time calculations on,

121
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
if I can blackberry stop it, I'm so annoyed with that thing.

122
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That thumb wheel is just driving the Apes shit.

123
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And I'm having to find all the keyboard shortcuts.

124
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
P dub suggested that maybe it's because I'm recording using,

125
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
indirectly, I must say,

126
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
and that's where it kind of breaks down from me.

127
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Indirectly on a 60 Hertz alternating current system,

128
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
which is here, which is what is used in Europe versus,

129
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
no, that's not right.

130
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's 60 Hertz in the US.

131
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
50 Hertz here, I think, isn't it?

132
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I don't know.

133
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Either way, I think the best advice is, indeed,

134
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
the Casio Court's wristwatch from Argos.

135
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Hi, Adam.

136
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's Dennis from the Daddycast with a really funny name.

137
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You know, come on, say it with me.

138
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
101 uses four baby wives.

139
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Man, I just had a heart attack with excitement.

140
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
When I got the QIDJ memo,

141
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
but, you know, then I heard you say on the daily source code

142
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
that I'd be a beta tester for pod show.

143
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I started thinking, beta tester,

144
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
that all I am to use a beta tester.

145
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm not a freaking lab rock.

146
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I am not an animal.

147
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Ah, then I came to my senses, dude.

148
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Pass the cheese.

149
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I am so in.

150
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah, 101 uses for baby wives as a pretty messed up name,

151
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
but I deliver serious news and information parents can use right now.

152
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But hey, wait, it's not all heavy stuff.

153
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I have guests, interviews from newsmakers,

154
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
and music makers.

155
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So look, there's lots of fun here, too.

156
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's real simple.

157
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
If you love your kids, then you will love this show.

158
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Your kids will love it, too.

159
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
101 uses for baby wives.

160
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
proud to be a member of the pod show family.

161
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Thank you, everybody. Bye, bye, bye.

162
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh, man.

163
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I knew someone was going to take a fence to that.

164
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
When I said, oh, we're having a beta test, too.

165
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
No, I'm glad you're digging it.

166
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I saw a guy in a girl, a bottle,

167
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
had set up there, a show site,

168
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
and it's really starting to look cool.

169
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I went to bed last night and was on with Kevin.

170
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Who was developing from home,

171
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
and we passed a couple of messages woke up this morning

172
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
to take Christina to school.

173
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
He was still on, of course he's in San Francisco.

174
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So it was only like 11 p.m. or whatever.

175
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But it's getting there, getting very, very close.

176
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And once we have like 25 people that are going to come in first

177
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and then we'll start to open things up.

178
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yesterday we made all the final decisions on what would be

179
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
called the terms and conditions.

180
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But I think it would be happy.

181
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Show up willing to work and have fun and grow an audience.

182
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And if you're interested in making money too,

183
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
you're going to have a lot of fun.

184
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I promise you that.

185
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
No audio feedback today.

186
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
However, we do.

187
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
No audio feedback today.

188
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
No audio feedback today.

189
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
No audio feedback today.

190
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
No audio feedback today.

191
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
No audio feedback today.

192
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
No audio feedback today.

193
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
No audio feedback today.

194
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
No audio feedback.

195
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No audio feedback.

196
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
No audio feedback.

197
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
No audio feedback.

198
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
No audio feedback.

199
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yeah.

200
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm working on the different sound settings on CASBlast.

201
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I think the music and effects, as I would call them,

202
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and promo's and stuff, were going through some kind of audio chain

203
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
that was making a sound of it bit crappy.

204
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I got several reports for a piano.

205
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And it's hard, you know, because you record the show on your headphones

206
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and then you listen on speakers.

207
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Then you listen on your iPod.

208
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,560
and, you know, before you know, you have no reference point anywhere.

209
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,320
You don't know what sounds good or not.

210
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,720
Anyway, today's Metro Sexual Moment is pretty much all about

211
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,280
the new Gillette Razor, I think everyone

212
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,760
and their dog sent me a link to this thing.

213
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,760
It's called the Fusion.

214
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,000
It is, let me see, there's a Reuters story here.

215
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Now, this is the one that they jumped from three to four

216
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,600
to five blades is where they're at now.

217
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,800
And of course, Proctor and Gamble posted a 29% jump

218
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,200
accordingly profit driven by strengthened its household

219
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,840
and beauty businesses and the addition of the Gillette business

220
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,880
it acquired in October.

221
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,480
The company which makes Crest to paste,

222
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
to herself batteries, and most of other products also

223
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,880
raised its earning and expectations for the year.

224
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,320
$2.55 billion do, that's a lot of shame.

225
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,800
So let me see if I got some information on this thing.

226
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,960
This wonderful new Fusion Razor, I guess the concept

227
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,560
is kind of the same.

228
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,520
It has a battery, so it vibrates, but now it has five blades.

229
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,080
Here's the, oh, in the crazy orange packaging.

230
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,640
Pandemonium, everybody.

231
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,040
Let me see.

232
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,040
Here's a testimonial from a website from Ismoto.

233
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,960
I got my Fusion last night, Houston.

234
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,240
I used it and I think it's a winner.

235
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,760
The blade cartridge is much larger,

236
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,960
but the individual blades are about 50% smaller

237
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,920
than the mock three turbo.

238
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,320
Huh, the shave feels much different than the M3T.

239
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,800
Maybe it was because of the new cartridge,

240
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,880
but the shave seemed closer with less razor burn.

241
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,560
The single blade on the back is a great idea.

242
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,640
They've got a blade on the back.

243
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,120
Oh, that's so you can get underneath your nose there.

244
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,960
Ooh, that's dangerous.

245
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,840
If you're cut right there, the right in your nose,

246
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,600
God, this sucks ass.

247
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,240
Fusion review here, John Flowers says,

248
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,600
I thought you might wanna check this page

249
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,000
and he sends me the free stuff page,

250
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,200
which is where you can also read more

251
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,640
about the fusion.

252
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,840
And then, thank goodness,

253
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,080
we have to wait for a Brit to do it.

254
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,240
Neil Conqueron says,

255
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,600
I got some Metro sexual haven in the UK for you.

256
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,200
Listening to the show for a while now,

257
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,440
realized that last weekend is a place in Glasgow.

258
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,280
You might wanna go, it's called the men's store.

259
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,000
You can get everything you need there,

260
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,840
quoting from the site,

261
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,480
we do haircutting and colorizing.

262
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,840
Open razor-hot towel,

263
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,040
wet shave, relaxing facial stress,

264
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,760
busting facials, business manicure,

265
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,960
and that sometimes necessary backwax

266
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,680
to name but a few.

267
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,560
So that's everything except Botox and one shop.

268
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,920
City's about an hour and a half from London.

269
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,680
By plane, there's an online show.

270
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,960
Maybe a good sponsor for the Metro sexual moment.

271
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
Maybe that's, maybe it's not a sponsor,

272
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,960
maybe it's a destination for the Delta's urine.

273
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,040
Can you read Metro's sexual moment?

274
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,880
Yeah.

275
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,680
Hi Adam, this is Mark Curtis

276
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,040
for the Military Bratch Registry podcast.

277
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,160
Before I give you a sample of what I do on,

278
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,640
every brat has a story,

279
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,760
I want to hit you with some aviation bragging rights.

280
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,960
Have you ever flown in the cockpit of the Concord

281
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,800
as it takes off from JFK to Paris or I have?

282
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,240
I've ever flown the 747 simulator at Quantas and Sydney,

283
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,960
flying with three engines out,

284
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,160
then landing at night in fog on instruments.

285
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,000
I have, I've ever flown a British strike master jet

286
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,560
over Cape Town, South Africa,

287
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,240
doing loops, rolls and spins.

288
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,840
I have, not bad for 500 hour private instrument rated pilot A,

289
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,200
each yard out.

290
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,040
Well, then maybe I just shouldn't play your promo.

291
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,640
Dude, or is there something to this?

292
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,600
It's gonna make me really happy at the end.

293
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Okay, and I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt here.

294
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,760
What does all this have to do with the Military Bratch Registry podcast?

295
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,600
Yeah.

296
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,760
Absolutely nothing.

297
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,280
I just wanted to make you jealous.

298
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,880
So what is the Military Bratch Registry?

299
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,960
Dude, yeah, I'm also an army brat, by the way.

300
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,880
Just so you know, so let's be careful here.

301
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,640
Podcast about, it's about interviews with people

302
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,040
who grew up in military families all over the world.

303
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,000
Military Brats, which is a positive term that we embrace

304
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,400
because the definition of brat is child of.

305
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,280
So we are children of the Military.

306
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,760
It doesn't mean we're warm mongers.

307
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,800
It just means we follow our parents to bases around the world

308
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,560
and sometimes lived in war zones,

309
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,200
as well as exotic locations like Thailand or Morocco.

310
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,640
The stories are fascinating.

311
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,000
Imagine living in Vietnam as a 15-year-old girl in 1965.

312
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,280
Or how about attending the Nuremberg Driles

313
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,200
as a high school field trip?

314
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,760
Those are just a sample of what you'll hear

315
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,000
on the every Brat has a story podcast at militarybrat.com.

316
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Search for Military Brats in iTunes

317
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,320
or your choice of software.

318
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:48,120
I'm a little jealous, but I'm happy for you, my friend.

319
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,280
Happy.

320
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,760
Do you believe anything is possible?

321
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,600
We do.

322
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,280
We're our flank.

323
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,320
We believe in an internet that's safe from virus,

324
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,520
hidden scammers.

325
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,160
We're our flank.

326
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,000
We believe your personal information

327
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,960
should be just that, personal.

328
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,920
And we believe your internet should be a friend, not a foe.

329
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,760

We revolve around you.

335
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,160
Me and met me, you.

336
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,240
All our life will take them.

337
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,280
We want to go free, want to go free.

338
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,000
Interviews.

339
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,600
Hello, this is Bob from France for Nand.

340
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,000
And we're all looking to hope to bring them.

341
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,480
I want to come to Netherlands.

342
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,840
Now, don't do it.

343
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,200
I'll do Martin's up to pay say,

344
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,920
met me through podcast.

345
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,720
Check the site and what's it.

346
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,120
We've a very good met me.

347
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,320
He'll put an L.

348
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,320
Robonae.

349
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,160
That's my old radio buddy from the used to be a radio

350
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,880
Veronica with me.

351
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,640
Now he's on Radio 3.

352
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,040
He'll fainst, right?

353
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,960
And I guess I don't know if he's making

354
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,400
a podcast of his show.

355
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,120
I'm subscribed to some feed that he puts out,

356
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,800
but usually it's interviews, some chick does.

357
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,680
And I don't like the chicken of use.

358
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,600
I want to hear my buddy, Michiel.

359
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,320
But then of course, it's all the rights and royalties issues.

360
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,640
Ah, which on the podcast, the extended podcast version,

361
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,400
the extended finals of the show will be talking about

362
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,560
some interesting stuff going on in the rights world in Europe.

363
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,720
So stay tuned for that.

364
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,240
And more audio feedback.

365
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,440
Well, I made a mistake.

366
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,560
I let my kid listen to the D.S.E.

367
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,240
and now he's accusing me of copying your show.

368
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,280
You see, I have a podcast called The Vap

369
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,320
or vintage air stream podcast where we talk about

370
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,520
RVs, motorhomes, trailers.

371
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,320
And of course, those riveted together aluminum pods,

372
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,920
known as air streams.

373
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,960
Now it could be that he thinks I'm copying your show

374
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,920
because I had a sound scene tour in my last show.

375
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,960
Or maybe it's just my show's opening.

376
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,960
rivets, we don't need no thinking rivets.

377
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,360
With two tons of aluminum hits to his bumper.

378
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,200
Who's in down here in a super highway?

379
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,280
The Vap is streaming right to your ears.

380
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:04,280
And now you're host for the vintage air stream podcast, Tim Shepard.

381
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,760
I'm a man in a loon, not good.

382
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,440
Could be he's on the something.

383
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,840
Everyone else can decipher themselves by going to the Vap.com,

384
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,160
that's THE, VAP.com and give us a listen.

385
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,960
Thanks, Adam.

386
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,160
I don't think that was a mistake.

387
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,920
Did you kid that it's a sincerest form of flattery?

388
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,920
All right, I'm going to do some of this European copyright stuff.

389
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,520
EU is the anti-trust regulator.

390
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,440
I think that's a Dutch woman, Naly Smith Cruz,

391
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,960
is about to issue formal charges against the societies

392
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,720
responsible for collecting music royalties across Europe

393
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,200
for breaking anti-competitive rules.

394
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,920
And this is thanks to Jam J, who sent this into me, Joe, Joseph John.

395
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,120
The charges are a response to a complaint brought by RTL,

396
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,800
Radio Television Luxembourg in 2000.

397
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,000
It's argued that it should be able to get rights to use a piece of music

398
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,760
across Europe by going through a single collecting society rather than having

399
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,960
to negotiate with a different society in each country in which it broadcasts.

400
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,160
Here's the European Union at work now, guys.

401
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,080
They very close attention because they're going to make rules that will work

402
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,960
for every country.

403
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,760
So if we've already seen that the rules vary from European state to state,

404
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,360
let's just call it that, now they're going to consolidate all that.

405
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,560
It goes on, the case has raised concerns and smaller European Union countries

406
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,560
that their collecting societies could lose out to more powerful bodies,

407
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,800
such as Gamma and Germany and MCPSPRS in the UK.

408
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,520
The European Commission has criticized the fact that the authors are forced

409
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,880
to transfer their rights to the collecting society of the country in which they reside.

410
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,320
Ah, so there are an our side, apparently.

411
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,440
And the users of those rights must acquire separate licenses for each territory.

412
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,840
It is also critical of agreements between the various EU collecting societies.

413
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,160
You know what, what is happening here is all the crap is coming to the top.

414
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,320
Now there may be more crap they're going to put in place,

415
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:07,680
but I think that all these inequalities, inequities, all these differences

416
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,080
between countries and all these weird little rules that we found out about

417
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,680
where even if you have your own music that you want to play on your own podcast,

418
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,000
you can only do that if you pay the performing rights society money.

419
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,040
I mean, this is, this is crazy, this is crazy.

420
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,760
Now, hopefully we've done a little bit better today on the timing.

421
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,680
And we're going to fit just inside the satellite window.

422
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:39,080
So those of you checking this out on serious stars 103,

423
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,400
you know what, I'm seeing cast blasts are already said that the window closed.

424
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,480
This is ludicrous.

425
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,720
This is crazy.

426
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,040
This is absolutely nuts.

427
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,880
Look at this now.

428
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,760
The countdown clock is only kicking in now.

429
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,080
Well, PW, I'm sorry, my friend.

430
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,320
I hope you didn't have to work too hard and put them all back together today.

431
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,440
I got to figure this out.

432
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,800
There's something very, very wrong.

433
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,160
Well, at least we have another chance later on this week.

434
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:10,280
And here's a thing that came in that, from Mark Bars, he sent me this from the Netherlands.

435
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,760
And this is really interesting.

436
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:18,520
Now, we've talked about royalties or levies that are fees basically that are taken,

437
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,920
or you pay for them when you buy blank media, like blank DVDs and blank CDs.

438
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,040
Because, of course, you can, you know, just like cassette tapes,

439
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,440
you can record music and that's a loss of a sale for the music industry.

440
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,720
So, and there's this organization called Stifting the Divescopy in the Netherlands.

441
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:42,680
And their job is to collect these fees, which actually, the money's pretty amazing.

442
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:49,400
Let me see, a 4.7 gigabyte DVD, 60 Euro cents.

443
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:56,040
So, that's about 75 US dollar cents goes to this organization.

444
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:02,520
And if an audio CD or a regular CD raw, I guess they mean 42 cents, so that's about 50 cents.

445
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,280
That's quite a lot, actually.

446
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,360
What is the blank one cost, like a buck?

447
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:12,040
So, a lot of that money apparently goes to this organization that is supposed to

448
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:19,240
divvy out the money according to, you know, special secret codes and decoder rings and all kinds of

449
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,720
way to figure out who deserves what money from that.

450
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:28,440
Because, of course, they don't know actually what it was used for, but they are, let me see,

451
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:38,600
who is doing this, which ministers pissed off about this, the justice minister of justice.

452
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:44,680
And he sent a note to Parliament saying that he's going to make a big deal about this,

453
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,920
because they're taking way too long to pay out.

454
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,480
And apparently the reporting systems are not up to par.

455
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:00,520
In addition to this, I guess he's fighting for more discussion, at least, about having similar

456
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:07,640
levies put on to hard drives and other devices such as MP3 players.

457
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:13,560
Got to keep an eye on this, guys, because this will be shoot, I didn't want to do that,

458
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,080
I mean, doing it.

459
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,720
Got to keep an eye on it, because, you know, this could be something that is eventually

460
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:25,080
whatever is decided in the Netherlands, particularly because Naly Smith Cruz, who is the anti-competition

461
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:31,400
minister, is Dutch, you know, this actually could be some of what the law making the European

462
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,440
law making in process before a very eyes. Now let's play this song. It's bubble and sparkle star.

463
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:56,920
Telling a panic crazy, silence is your price, I can sit in your eyes, now tell me are you

464
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:15,640
yourself again, crashing on your dust, smiling in my hand. I always walk away, every time I look at you,

465
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,360
I can't believe I'll ever love again.

466
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:38,680
Do me the make-up, make it up slow, and do me the make-up, say goodbye, bye-bye, bye-bye,

467
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:48,680
shaking on my phone, come on still not slow, the world's just getting out too soon,

468
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:59,960
so then, we're seeing a good make-up and it's there now, so then,

469
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:09,480
we're always walking away, but every time I look at you, I can't believe I'll ever love again.

470
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

471
00:29:39,480 --> 00:30:09,480
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

472
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:17,480
You're just the star, the star always gets inside my hand

473
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,480
And I'm not you on the way

474
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,480
Because every time I need you

475
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,480
I can't believe I'll ever die again

476
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,480
I can't believe no no no no no

477
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,480
Maybe I'm just the boy

478
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:51,480
I'll be your base that will stop

479
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:57,480
I'll be your base that will stop

480
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,480
Just like you

481
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,480
Do me make you cry

482
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,480
Make you fall so

483
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:15,480
Burn it down and turn it crazy

484
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,480
Never feel I'll make you feel

485
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,480
All I wanted you to feel

486
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,480
Bubble, sparkle star

487
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,480
Think I played up was there Christmas here on bars

488
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,480
One of the songs I bought a little bit

489
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,480
I played like it very much

490
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,480
Is that a cab?

491
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,480
Hold on a second, let me check and see

492
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,480
Is that it?

493
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,480
I think Patricia's going into town

494
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,480
Here's something cool, Rocket Boom

495
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:57,480
Has put up a week's worth of commercial airtime

496
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,480
On eBay, very novel like this a lot

497
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,480
So what they're guaranteeing here is

498
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,480
Hold on a second, I think is a million

499
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,480
What do they say here?

500
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,480
The advertisement reached for this auction

501
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,480
It's currently a minimum of 1 million views

502
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,480
They say that they get 130,000 people per day to watch each day's video

503
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,480
Over the course of several days

504
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,480
Each one receives over 200,000 complete views

505
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,480
So that's how they come up with 1 million views

506
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,480
The flight time as we say in the biz

507
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,480
Will be the week of what is it?

508
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,480
March 6 through March 10th 2006

509
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,480
Each day that we could different commercial

510
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,480
That they create for your company

511
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,480
Will be played at the conclusion of the Rocket Boom episode

512
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
And they're going to make them, they're going to make the spots

513
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,480
They'll be about 15 seconds

514
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,480
They will also own them, they will be responsible for the creative

515
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,480
So I love this because this is a complete reversal of the way advertising works

516
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,480
This is fantastic

517
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,480
And I was kind of wondering why no one had tried this before

518
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
Why no one had done it

519
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,480
In fact, I would have expected to do something like this

520
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:14,480
But I guess this is in essence what I've always hoped for

521
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,480
Is it baby?

522
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,480
Are you going? What are you going to do?

523
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,480
I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it

524
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,480
Okay, I'm going to do it

525
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,480
All right, we'll figure it out

526
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,480
We'll figure it out

527
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,480
I love you

528
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,480
Oh boy, she wants to go to

529
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,480
Her sister is opening up a store in Rotterdam

530
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,480
I think it's on the 18th February

531
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,480
And I told her I would be in New York

532
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,480
The week of the 12th now, you know, just taking air travel, etc. into account

533
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,480
It's probably going to be very hard for me to get back before she has to leave

534
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,480
In fact, you'd probably have to leave the 17th

535
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,480
And, you know, it's like who's going to watch the house

536
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,480
Who's going to watch Christina?

537
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,480
Is Christina going to go where there?

538
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,480
We still have a dog, you know, all that stuff

539
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:06,480
Sometimes work and play just do a not coordinate

540
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,480
Sex, we'll figure it out as I told her, we'll figure it out

541
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,480
So current bid is up to $7,602

542
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,480
And the reserve has still not been met

543
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,480
In advertising terms, that would be about a

544
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,480
Seven and a half dollar CPM or cost per thousand

545
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,480
Which is definitely on the low end of the scale

546
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,480
Which is why I'm pretty sure that the reserve has not been met yet

547
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,480
45 bid, let me see who's bidding

548
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,480
It's pretty interesting, it's like the internet guys

549
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,480
5% card dot com has really been bidding it up

550
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,480
See what else?

551
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,480
Blog ads, capital learning

552
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,480
You know, and like Dave Texas and Ed Cole, these are all

553
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,480
Guys who have all kinds of stuff going on

554
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,480
The eBay guys really have stuff going on with sales

555
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,480
But you know what, that's a perfectly fine market

556
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,480
And we'll be interesting to see if courses

557
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,480
When they sell that one out, when they, and I'm sure that this will sell

558
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,480
I'm hoping that they'll then immediately put up a new one

559
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,480
For the next week, because to make it sustainable, they'll have to do that

560
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,480
Imagine making 30, 40 grand a month, just by doing your show

561
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,480
And having eBay people bid on eBay, you know, it's all contained

562
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,480
Wow, a whole new economy of advertising, oh boy

563
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,480
I love it, fantastic, and more good news for Amanda Condon

564
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,480
She will be, I guess she's playing, I don't know if it's a bit

565
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,480
Part, if it's a walk on, if it's a cameo, which will be on the

566
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,480
Let me see, tomorrow's episode of CSI

567
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,480
Oh, playing herself, all right?

568
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Cool, how very hip of CSI to do that?

569
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,480
Excellent thing, okay, those things I didn't get to yesterday

570
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,480
Wouldn't get to say it get to today, so when we may go a little bit long

571
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,480
But I should be able to blow through it in about 10 or 15 minutes

572
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,480
Let's see what we have here. Oh, this is good, you're like this

573
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,480
Hey, Peter

574
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:09,480
Hi, this is a special edition, a very brief announcement about digital

575
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,480
Flatzom, I'm PW Phantom, the next edition of digital

576
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,480
Flatzom will mark its one year anniversary, I almost missed it

577
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,480
I was searching for a digital Flatzom file today

578
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,480
When I suddenly realized I was looking at files from January 2005

579
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,480
So my plans for the next edition went out the window

580
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,480
Next edition will be a one year anniversary retrospective

581
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,480
And I invite everyone who would like to send me an audio comment to

582
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,480
Please send it to audio stuff

583
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,480
That's one word, audio stuff at gmail.com

584
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,480
Or if you don't have a way to record a comment and stick it in a file

585
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,480
Call and leave a message via this Skype button on my website at digitalflatzom.org

586
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,480
Please, if you're going to do it, do it soon

587
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,480
So I can get a new edition of digital Flatzom out there quickly

588
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,480
I'm actually excited about this

589
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,480
I hope to see you all very very soon

590
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,480
With the one year anniversary edition of digital Flatzom

591
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,480
Yeah, I'm on

592
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,480
And PW, hold it, the Mark Kerson

593
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,480
So funny when PW says

594
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,480
I'm actually excited, like I want to step back from the speakers

595
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,480
You know, for all the excitement that's oozing out

596
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,480
Congratulations PW on your one year anniversary, I love you

597
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,480
There, now you can put that in your show and then I don't have to cut something separate for you

598
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,480
Isn't that perfect?

599
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,480
Okay Adam, this is Michael kicking me out with the indigenous people's music podcast

600
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:44,480
I've been listening to DSC pretty much for about a year now

601
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,480
Or a little more than a year

602
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,480
And some of your more recent shows

603
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,480
Talking about pod shows plans

604
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,480
For revenue generation to artists and podcasters

605
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Through the podsafe music network

606
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,480
I agree with everything that I've heard so far

607
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,480
And anything that can help benefit both podcaster

608
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,480
And the artists, I think are good ideas

609
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,480
But my question today actually deals with

610
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,480
A different side of podcasting that I don't

611
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,480
Really feel as getting as much attention as it really

612
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:27,480
Shouldn't really wonder if pod show had some ideas around statistics

613
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,480
And how we measure our audiences

614
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,480
I'm currently with Libs in right now

615
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,480
And they have a pretty good tool set

616
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,480
Compared to a few others that I've looked at briefly

617
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,480
But they still deal with a lot of generalities

618
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,480
In terms of new listeners, verses

619
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,480
Maybe listeners that we've had for a while

620
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,480
And I was wondering if there was actually a way

621
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,480
To measure our audiences based on unique IP addresses

622
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,480
So that we would know or have a way of tracking independently

623
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,480
Who was a newer listener

624
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,480
Versus people that actually had been subscribed

625
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,480
To our podcas for a while

626
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,480
For say at least six months or more

627
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,480
And I haven't seen any tools address this

628
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,480
That much but I would find that to be pretty valuable

629
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,480
Information when it comes to trying to market our shows

630
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,480
And things like that and gaining new audience

631
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,480
It's always nice to be able to speak to our older audience

632
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,480
One way and then when you're welcoming new listeners

633
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,480
That you simply know that based on your stats

634
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,480
And you can speak to them and market to them a different way

635
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,480
So it's something just having stats alone

636
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,480
This specific I think is a benefit

637
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,480
Something I don't believe the music industry can produce

638
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,480
Other than maybe iTunes in terms of numbers of people

639
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,480
Downloading music and their IP addresses or something like that

640
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,480
So I was just curious what podcho may have might be having

641
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,480
Or might be planning rather

642
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,480
In the area of listeners statistics

643
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,480
So I don't know if you can share anything with us right now

644
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,480
But I was just curious about that

645
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,480
All right great thanks Adam appreciate it

646
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,480
Again my name is Michael kicking bear with indigenous peoples music

647
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
All right Michael, thank you

648
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,480
Yes, I think well when it comes to statistics

649
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,480
And I think it's no secret at this point that we've

650
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,480
Going into partnership with limelight networks

651
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,480
To create the podcas delivery network the PDN as we call it

652
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,480
And so at the network level is where you can get the best

653
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,480
Statistics about you know all that stuff that I'm sure

654
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,480
Libs and provides equally as well because they're also

655
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,480
Sitting at the network level

656
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,480
What we've learned is it's really not so much about the

657
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,480
Information it's about how it's presented or how it's

658
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,480
Analyzed and

659
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,480
People process information in different ways

660
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,480
So the tool the last time I looked at it was really really

661
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,480
Really really spiffy you can actually create the report the way you

662
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,480
Want it in order segments

663
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,480
You know pie charts color bar graphs whatever all that stuff

664
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,480
You know so and we have a couple of examples of of layers

665
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,480
You get a dashboards when you log in

666
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,480
You can see the highlight reports that you're most interested in

667
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,480
And all that stuff I think is pretty well defined

668
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,480
And any statistical package with what's available

669
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:38,480
In weblog in for data as well as some network data

670
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,480
And maybe others some as a couple other things that

671
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,480
Most I think is all captured in the web server log

672
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,480
You know that that's one part of the report

673
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,480
The tools that you're talking about are much more interested in

674
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,480
Because I think what's really missing here is you know now you're just talking about

675
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,480
Computers connecting to a computer and passing off information about

676
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,480
It's about about about about the computer itself

677
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,480
It really doesn't say much about the operator

678
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,480
That's why we spend so much time on giving a place for your listeners to go

679
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,480
So that they can become involved with the show and with each other

680
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,480
And it's you know a very rudimentary form of that of course is a forum

681
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,480
You know where you can see who's active how long they've been active

682
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:24,480
If they're online right now, you know that kind of stuff is are the beginnings of tools

683
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,480
But I think we've taken that to a whole nother level

684
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,480
That's really where for me all the excitement comes in

685
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,480
Is that that you're going to be able to you know

686
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,480
To speak to your listeners know who they are or who they want to be

687
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,480
Who they want how they want to represent themselves

688
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,480
Again the connection between listeners themselves is great

689
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,480
And those those relationships

690
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,480
Really do create metrics that you can you can look at over time

691
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,480
And it works equally well with with the simpler

692
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,480
With you know proven stuff actually like forums

693
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,480
You know don and Drew have what 40,000 registered users at the forum all of whom are like 30,000 are active

694
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:08,480
That's a tremendous metric and then you can start to correlate stuff with the downloads etc

695
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:14,480
But I think the big the big thing that a lot of people are missing is everyone's talking

696
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:21,480
Still about subscriptions because of the underpinnings of podcasting and podcast delivery with RSS

697
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:27,480
And a subscribing to a feed but that really is not the same as a magazine subscription

698
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,480
First of all there's no cost involved at least typically there's no cost involved

699
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,480
And there's no information known about the subscriber

700
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,480
Very little information and no more than would show up in a web server log

701
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,480
So if you really want to connect and you really want to do things with your audience

702
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,480
Then you know we have to give you tools so that the audience members can make their own place within your show

703
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,480
Does it sound cryptic enough?

704
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,480
We're really working hard on it. Oh a quick blog for Heather and Janelle

705
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:00,480
If you haven't heard the show it's sponsored by a active view underwritten by a qview

706
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,480
I should say it's an active view show

707
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:09,480
But it's getting a lot of a lot of downloads a lot of people checking out their show

708
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,480
You can find it download.acview.com

709
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,480
Hi Adam my name's down long time listener

710
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,480
I've been interested in getting my own podcast going as has many of your listeners

711
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,480
And today I thought I'd have another browse around the PMN

712
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,480
Just something that you might want to get your voice to have a look at

713
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,480
When I was looking at the artists page

714
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,480
The page title is coming up as untitled document

715
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:43,480
It would probably be better and cleaner and more professional looking

716
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,480
If it had either the track title or perhaps the artist title coming up at the top

717
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,480
Surely it's just something that's been overlooked

718
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:57,480
I'm currently using Firefox. I'm not sure if that's the issue whether it works properly in the other browser

719
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:03,480
Following on from your conversation the other day about people listening to the daily source code

720
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,480
And other podcasts on devices other than iPods

721
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,480
I frequently use my Sony Ericsson K750

722
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:16,480
And play the daily source code through the speaker on that not using the headphones

723
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,480
But actually just having it set on the desk beside me

724
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:24,480
What I found recently and this may be since you've moved across to using cast blaster

725
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,480
Is that the volume of your show in general seems to have gone down a lot

726
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,480
I don't know whether this is something you can measure against a previous show

727
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,480
And either put me right or wrong

728
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,480
But I seem to have to have the volume turned a lot louder

729
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,480
In fact thinking of it

730
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,480
Even when I'm playing it on my computer now

731
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:49,480
If I'm listening to the daily source code and then have that ubiquitous you've got mail come up

732
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,480
It's always a lot louder than your recordings

733
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,480
Something you might want to look into

734
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,480
But thanks very much for the daily source code and great work you're doing towards podcasting

735
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,480
Thank you very much, bye

736
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,480
Well, I've been working on that

737
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,480
Ever since I started using cast blaster been very careful about the levels

738
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,480
And trying to get the sound to be just right and so a lot of people are given feedback for me

739
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,480
As I said it's very hard to get a reference

740
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:19,480
After you've recorded the show you hear you know on your headphones for almost an hour in a certain way

741
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,480
And then you know then you're listening to a speakers that sounds different on ear buds

742
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,480
It sounded different so I'm working on it

743
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:30,480
And I've been very careful because the first couple shows I did people complain about over modulating

744
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,480
And the sound was clipping so I'm really learning the meters inside this thing

745
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:40,480
And I'm not hitting zero db and in fact I'm probably around minus 10

746
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,480
According to the meters I'm just being really careful

747
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:47,480
So apparently it could still even be a bit louder yet

748
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,480
So keeping in the loop I've turned it up a bit let me know if it's better for you

749
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,480
Hey Mr. Adam curry what's up man

750
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,480
This is Simon Smith from the new music lab dot code

751
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,480
I'm not looking for a plug on your show

752
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,480
In fact I want to plug your show

753
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,480
So is there a promo for the daily source code

754
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,480
You would make my listeners really happy if I could give that a play on the new music lab

755
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,480
That would make them extremely happy if the pod father himself

756
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,480
To introduce the team from the bond safe music network

757
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,480
That's up to you

758
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,480
That's all I want to mean don't worry about

759
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,480
Rock on

760
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:29,480
Oh, you know there is no promo for the show

761
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,480
And I should do when I guess

762
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,480
It's a part of the new show site actually to have a promo so it'll look a lot better

763
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:44,480
Right now I'm also looking up a flight some virgin Atlantic see if I can make it back before Patricia has to leave

764
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,480
Let me see from New York to London

765
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:54,480
Departing on see if I departed Friday how late could I go Friday could I make it at the end they got triple miles this month

766
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,480
Hey hey wait let's go

767
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,480
Oh shoot

768
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,480
Oh no from London

769
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:08,480
Okay one way right from New York to London 17th February fine flights okay

770
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,480
Upper class

771
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,480
Oh yeah baby

772
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:21,480
Virgin upper class triple miles throughout the end of March matching the be it British airways promotions love that

773
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,480
Okay, come on website hurry up

774
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,480
Oh what's the latest one I like to go it

775
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,480
I could go at

776
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,480
925

777
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,480
Well Patricia could just leave if she could do if she could leave

778
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,480
Saturday morning I could arrive Saturday morning would be okay

779
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:47,480
And then she'd come back Sunday and then but then I might have to go back to San Francisco the week after

780
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,480
But at least I'd be back in and be able to help her out in the weekend

781
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,480
Okay

782
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,480
Oh shoot

783
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,480
Sorry we already did it one here's the

784
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,480
I had almost a lot

785
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,480
I'm in about the pot saved music network

786
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:05,480
Now I know a lot of people have been talking about pricing you know what the splits gonna be two ways splits but how about a three way split

787
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,480
That's right a three way split

788
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,480
I love three ways

789
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,480
Because you instead of affiliate links that go on your blog that lead to the pot saved music network

790
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,480
So if someone used your link they would get say five cents per song

791
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:22,480
Which may seem steep or may seem like now a lot but that'll definitely add up over time

792
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:28,480
Let's take your podcast for example in the source code you usually play about two songs per episode

793
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:34,480
It's two songs per episode five episodes per week if you're getting five cents a song

794
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:40,480
And someone is using your link every song that's 50 cents per week for doing basically nothing

795
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:46,480
Now I'm not gonna do the math but if you can give people the incentive to buy music from the pot saved music network

796
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,480
Why not do it?

797
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,480
By the way Adam using a brand new Intel iMac

798
00:49:53,480 --> 00:50:01,480
20 inch cord duo and the brand new garage band bundled an iLat 06 to record this audio comment

799
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,480
All right, cool nice little fade up there

800
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:11,480
What a testimonial fantastic. Yeah, well, that's exactly the idea

801
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:16,480
So why don't we split it in half and split it in half and split it in half something like that

802
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:26,480
It doesn't matter we're gonna get this roll and so along with the previous comment about about the artist page on the pot saved music network

803
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:32,480
Yeah definitely and jersey Joe and Dan they are doing they're sending the whole right now

804
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,480
I think they're doing with podcast alley, but then they're doing going to the same thing with the pot saved music network

805
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:42,480
Sending it back to what we call the jig and aviation and they're going to rewire it all completely

806
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:51,480
You know massively scalable and and often and often running and we'll have a lot of the hopefully most of all of those things fixed

807
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:59,480
We're definitely tracking all of it and we'll eventually get to what what I call an affiliate link

808
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:04,480
Absolutely, but it's really a part of the larger idea of an unlabel and unlabel is not a record label

809
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:13,480
It's all the pieces of a record label all connected through you know one or multiple systems and I think that's exactly what we're putting together here

810
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:23,480
And just like rocket boom getting advertising primarily from people on the internet who's livelihood is on the internet on eBay will also be able to start our own economies

811
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,480
You know, this is important stuff and tomorrow

812
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:33,480
Just think I want to do it today just in case I am I'm not able to get out of show

813
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:37,480
Because of travel or whatever and I'm going to go see my mom. I told you that

814
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:45,480
I want to say a very very happy birthday to my long distance lover on the podcast and GB

815
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,480
I like the picture you said

816
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:58,480
It's love spiral loves your eyes

817
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:28,480
Let's play how it helps me so you just don't care the solid truth

818
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:42,480
You know what's in your mind I still smile

819
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:52,480
You know what's in your mind I still smile

820
00:52:52,480 --> 00:53:03,480
You know what's in your mind I still smile
