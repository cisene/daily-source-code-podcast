Already a hit state side now you can check out the following podcast and good old

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,600
blighty btpotjo.com single-handedly making a men's for the Boston Tea Party one show at a time

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,580
I got it a 5-5-5m

4
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:49,260
was $60m worth of air planes strapped to my ass, then the next generation radio content

5
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:56,260
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

6
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:30,260
Keep it hit me, I don't know where it's just when I thought I had everything.

7
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:37,260
Did it recognize a feeling feel like a rush coming through me?

8
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:43,260
Yeah, you were shining like a downward second girl from a baby.

9
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:49,260
Your mystery is made to be my surprise.

10
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,260
And not a day, don't mind, don't mind, don't mind, don't mind.

11
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,260
I'll take my time, just think you're fine.

12
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,260
Not a day, don't mind, don't mind.

13
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:03,260
I don't mind when I think I'm flying into the future.

14
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:09,260
Keep it hit me, I don't know where it's just when I thought I had everything.

15
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:16,260
You're always looking at me, I don't know where it's just when I thought I had everything.

16
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,260
You're always looking at me, I don't know where it's just when I thought I had everything.

17
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:28,260
Yeah, you were just like a bitch, you're always so bright that you love me.

18
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:34,260
You're the world girl, and I'm feeling I never believed I would have me.

19
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:40,260
Tell you not to leave, and that wasn't changed my life.

20
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,260
And not a day, don't mind, don't mind, don't mind.

21
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,260
I'll take my time, just think you're fine.

22
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,260
Not a day, don't mind, don't mind.

23
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,260
I don't know where it's just when I think I'm flying into the future.

24
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:00,260
Keep it hit me, I don't know where it's just when I thought I had everything.

25
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:12,260
You're always looking at me, I don't know where it's just when I thought I had everything.

26

You're always looking at me, I don't know where it's just when I thought I had everything.

You're always looking at me, I don't know where it's just when I thought I had everything.

28
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:36,260
You're always looking at me, I don't know where it's just when I thought I had everything.

29
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:44,260
You're always looking at me, I don't know where it's just when I thought I had everything.

30
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:50,260
You're always looking at me, I don't know where it's just when I thought I had everything.

31
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:56,260
You're always looking at me, I don't know where it's just when I thought I had everything.

32
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:14,260
You're always looking at me, I don't know where it's just when I thought I had everything.

33
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:21,260
Ah, nothing like a little bit of cowbell.

34
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,960
You get to go on on a Tuesday.

35
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Everybody how you doing?

36
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,160
So that a source code coming to you from Curry Cottage in the affluent suburb of Surrey

37
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,660
known as Gulford.

38
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:35,260
That's Cherry Swade from Ontario, Canada, and not a day goes by.

39
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:40,420
Thank you very much to Brian, no for suggesting that a no secret there, the influences

40
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,220
has listed on the on the pontsive music network.

41
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,980
Of course, links to that in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com influences Brian Adams,

42
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,900
Bon Jovi, Deflopper, and the Beatles, Bibles.

43
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,900
You know what's so cool?

44
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,540
Every single time I do the cowbell because of the the microphone set up and the compression

45
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,540
and everything.

46
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,140
You know, if I hit the cowbell really hard, then it'll, you know, I got to find the right

47
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,340
mix for the music.

48
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,180
And so I take the the cowbell and my drumstick and I turn away from the microphone.

49
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,340
But when I do that, I'm looking straight at my mom, picture of my mom here on my desk

50
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,460
and she's looking back and she's always smiling at me and I can just hear her almost

51
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,500
thinking, he's so idiot.

52
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
Okay.

53
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:27,420
Mr. Mom for the next couple of days Patricia's off again to Rotterdam to go and practice rehearsal

54
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,420
for her.

55
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,260
I think she's doing two different dances, I don't know if it's two or three, two for

56
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:37,900
sure for dancing with the stars, which will be the year and episodes in the Netherlands

57
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,260
and she's very excited and of course she's out to win too and I think she's going to do

58
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,260
it.

59
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,740
She's really, she's so good at this stuff even though she's not trained at dancing.

60
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,220
She's just, she's got the rhythm, you know what I'm saying?

61
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:55,220
Hey, portions of this podcast are definitely not family friendly to me tell you right

62
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:00,460
now that even though you may find portions of today's show extremely humorous, some

63
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,340
of the topics discussed in the daily source code may not be appropriate for young ears

64
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,220
and may be very difficult to explain but since we're kind of in a, won't we do this?

65
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:14,620
We're, we're getting, here we go, we're this work, we're getting kind of into a, into a holiday

66
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,620
group here.

67
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:23,700
This is horrible, it's like, don't we have a better Christmas, Christmas music?

68
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,140
What's this Christmas Eve at the club, maybe this will sound better, let's try this.

69
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:35,140
We're getting into the holiday vibe here, everybody, there really is a lot of love going

70
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:42,260
around in the Pod Show family, of course we have thousands of shows now who are podcasting

71
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:48,100
out to the universe and sending you all kinds of good cheer for the holidays and well,

72
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:54,740
you know, you can always count on my fellow podcast network producers to make me feel really

73
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:01,060
nice and warm and, and just a part of their family and some people love this time of year.

74
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,260
Here's an example for a good tidings and holiday cheer from our Los Angeles chapter.

75
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:18,740
One thing, I never want to miss is Adam Curry's, Mary Mary Fistmus, oh yeah.

76
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:30,260
When Adam gets back to San Francisco, I'm gonna buy some stock in Chrisco,

77
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:36,980
there's big Christmas grin and holiday chuck goes ill tear up your o-ring with his

78
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:46,100
greased up knuckles from Thanksgiving, right to the new year he's got one hand right up your rear

79
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:54,420
and while you're celebrating holiday masses, he's ramming his fist right in the air asses it's

80
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:06,580
Adam Curry's, Mary Mary Fistmus, oh yeah.

81
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:16,180
When he gets started it's hard to make him stop. He'll treat you like Sherry Lewis,

82
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:24,020
treated lamb chop because he's bringing joy to all the girls and boys with a rubber ball gag and

83
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:32,260
the bag of sex toys. On his belt you'll see some missile toe and he's got his hand inside your

84
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:41,700
Cheerio and maybe while you let him deck your halls he'll give you a reach around and tickle your balls

85
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:57,380
it's oh yeah. Adam Curry's, Mary Mary Fistmus, insert cowbell here.

86
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:05,220
He's making a fist and greasing it twice and when he's all done you'll probably need ice.

87
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,900
He knows if you've been folding, he knows if you might scrunch and if you're really lucky he'll

88
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:22,100
give you a don't get bunch. Oh yeah. Adam Curry's, Mary Mary Fistmus.

89
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:30,340
That's a real sing along. Mary Mary Fistmus, Mary Mary Fistmus.

90
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:40,820
Happy Fistmus everybody. Mark I think we need to find some more things for you to do there.

91
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:48,020
Mary Fistmus Adam in the shock. Adventist Beach. Hey it's not like I didn't warn you okay?

92
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,260
Let's see what's going on some things that haven't seen a lot of post on around the net,

93
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:01,780
not yet at least. The first one is something happening here in the UK as reported by BBC,

94
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:09,460
the Everettrustworthy BBC. There was a lobby. I believe led by Sir Cliff Richard

95
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:17,540
to extend copyright in the United Kingdom to 95 years instead of the present 50 years.

96
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,980
And so now an independent review is going to recommend that these terms are not extended.

97
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,780
What this means and I understand where Sir Cliff is coming from by the way because he did

98
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:34,180
songs when he was 15, 16 years old. It probably even could even be older than that. Maybe even

99
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:44,420
when he was 17 or 18 and that was 50 years ago. In fact, it was at 2008 and back in the day

100
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:50,180
and we're talking like late 50s, Cliff Richard was without a doubt the British Elvis Presley.

101
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:56,820
I mean he was the shit and chicks loved him and guys loved everyone loved Sir Cliff. He wasn't a

102
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:02,660
certain. Everyone loved Cliff Richard. And so understandably he's saying hey what the fuck!

103
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:08,820
So when these things, when the copyright expires 50 years after their creation,

104
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,140
what that means that anyone can do anything they want with those songs in the public domain.

105
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,180
These were those songs we'll go. So automatically they could be played on podcasts. I wouldn't

106
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:22,980
mind playing summer holiday. That'd be kind of fun. Of course Sir Cliff will make no money on these

107
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,860
anymore. And so I understand his gripe about that. I don't know if he's making a shitload of money

108
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:33,300
off of summer holiday anymore. But I can understand certainly if someone were to do a remake.

109
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,740
I remember the young ones did a remake of summer holiday. It went to number one in many countries

110
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,140
around the world. So if that were to happen again then he'd obviously he would miss out and I

111
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:49,140
can understand where that's a farmer. But at the same time think about the wealth that he'll be adding

112
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:55,780
to the public domain literally by his songs coming into into that realm and being able to be

113
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,580
used and passed on and shared with the younger generation. I have no idea who Cliff Richard is

114
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:06,900
besides that old queen that keeps popping up. So I haven't seen a lot of news about that. And by the

115
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,380
way I think we'll see a lot more of these songs coming to the public domain over the next couple

116
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,540
years. I'm not quite sure what it is in the States now because that got so convoluted.

117
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:24,020
Sonny Bono was of course one of the people who passed legislation to extend copyrights. It's

118
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:30,580
basically a way for hollywood to have an edge. And that's okay. Don't mind. We don't really

119
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:35,540
need your shit necessarily but it'll be fun to be able to share. And this caught my attention yesterday

120
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:45,460
as a story on MacanN.com that Apple is apparently has filed for a patent on the concept

121
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:52,420
of a podcatcher. And if you read it, it literally describes what iPod or lemon did, what iPod or

122
00:12:52,420 --> 00:13:00,660
did. In fact, I think we could even argue the case that radio user land, the day-winer created,

123
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:07,460
that that even supersedes any patent attempts. And I looked at that and I said to myself, you know,

124
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,780
I think we should stop this. I mean, it wouldn't be fucking horrible if all the work that all

125
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,980
these developers spent on making this work and integrating it with Apple's product, if the

126
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:25,300
the patents were given to Apple, which of course is ludicrous because there's so much prior art

127
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,820
of this technology synchronizing. You know, iPod literally says, down automatically,

128
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,700
downloading podcasts, synchronizing it to a portable device. And we were doing all of that every single bit

129
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:44,580
of it. So I have asked our attorneys to form an opinion on how to block this because I think we should.

130
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:49,860
And well, of course, there's always one guy who can always trust in the case like this to weigh in

131
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,740
with his explicit commentaries.

132
00:13:52,820 --> 00:14:04,820
Comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, all right,

133
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:12,420
hitting C.S.B. Hi Adam Carey. When you woke up today, can you notice this each in your

134
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:21,220
ennus? Oh, yo, yo, some utterness wrote you a bad damn when you were sleeping. Who could it be?

135
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:30,500
Yes, it was Steve Jobs from Apple Corporation. He tickled your ego by inviting you to creation

136
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:38,580
of potfinder and hands podcast. And in meantime, Apple's lawyers were busy screwing up secretly

137
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:46,740
you personally Adam and whole pod of fear. Adam, I kindly ask you to stop sucking cock of

138
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:54,980
Steve Jobs and to oppose Apple's evil actions like patenting of iPoder. Recently,

139
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:01,700
I noticed on Wikipedia entry about Jeremy's effort and that he is one of inventors of podcasting.

140
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:09,300
If it will go on, then soon nobody will even know that you had something to do with invention

141
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:17,300
of podcasting and a stood as fetching MP3s from RSS automatically to media player. Adam,

142
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:26,420
just listen to me. You're genuine friend. Yo. Yo. Well, let me just say,

143
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,700
first of all, I don't believe that I think this is just an automatic process, which of course is

144
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:37,300
exactly what Apple should be doing. Everything they create needs to go through a process and if it can

145
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,300
be trademarked, if it can be a registered trademark, if it can be a patent, that I think that's pretty

146
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,380
much automatic. So I don't fault the corporation for doing that, but I'm not going to let it happen.

147
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,140
And by the way, add Kevin Marx to the list as well. All these people who created prior art,

148
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:57,300
what I commit today is that Pod Show will put up resources and funds to keep the entire concept

149
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:04,260
of a pod catcher in the public domain. I'm not quite sure if we have to make it. I mean,

150
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:12,340
the script I created iPoder was always open source from day one very clear. So, this patent

151
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,340
fuck you. It's not going to happen. Pod Show is going to put their money where their mouth is and

152
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,580
stop that. That will not take place.

153
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:52,340
I'm in that used to suck so bad and the pleasure. And I went into the bathroom and got myself off,

154
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:57,220
biting my lips the whole time because nobody would hear me. As the pod bother saves the world,

155
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:05,060
as only a former MTVVJ can with extreme prejudice. You are such a dickweed. Get the fuck out of my office.

156
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:13,620
Deep in the bowels of the curry cottage, plans are set. Splendid consumed and soon humanity will

157
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:20,660
experience a reckoning. That usually fucks companies up. For the next year there's going to be a

158
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:26,500
lot of turmoil and radio, trim everything down, get rid of the quote, excess fat, which is usually

159
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,620
comes in the form of chop people up into bits. So, I think this is the time we need to strike

160
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:44,340
drunk. Don't miss this daily event because if you do fuck you, Adam Curry and the daily source code.

161
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:50,020
This show is fucking awesome. This podcast is rated gigas.

162
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:56,100
All right, it's episode 505 of your daily source code of course. I say it's your daily source code

163
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,660
because you completely contribute to it and it does one way for you to do it if you live in an

164
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:19,940
UK pay attention, sing along and put this in yourself. So while we're here talking about the UK,

165
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,020
David, who sent in that David Graham, who sent in that six minute long comment. Yes,

166
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:31,300
today about Chris Moiles, the BBC, what they can and can't do with podcasts. Here at the call,

167
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:38,660
he edited it down to three minutes. Okay, let's listen. Hi, Adam. Listen to the feedback you

168
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:44,020
received from your listeners about the mention you got from Radio 1 DJ Chris Moiles. I have to

169
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:49,460
apply and make some corrections. Our response from one of your listeners called James made out

170
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:56,420
the Chris Moiles was against podcasting and saw no future in it. This is incorrect. Chris

171
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:02,820
actively promotes his podcast which in turn educates the public about podcasting. Chris would love

172
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:08,820
to do a original content for his podcast, but BBC rules restrict him from doing so and the following

173
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:14,900
explains this. It's the new and improved podcast this week and I'll tell you what how this works

174
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:19,300
and I'm going to explain to you exactly the truth, right? Who dug his currently loading it on

175
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:26,420
to the website as we speak? Here's how it works. The podcast through somebody's bizarre BBC rule

176
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:32,340
states that we can't have any new material on the podcast. It's all going to be stuff that we put

177
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:40,340
out on the radio. So to get around this this morning, so what do you got this morning,

178
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:46,420
the new show? It's between half three and four. We played out what will be today's podcast.

179
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,860
So technically what? No, it has been broken out. So therefore we can put it on. Yeah, so every week

180
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:56,660
half three to four in the morning on a Friday morning, we'll put the podcast out on the air.

181
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,540
Another lesson I call Chris Moiles Home of Public, which I also think is untrue.

182
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,700
Listening to Chris for over five years now, I cannot understand where these comments have come from.

183
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:14,580
Probably the tabloid media. Chris has a gay day producer who often picks on him for show entertainment.

184
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,380
The producer. Oh, please. This is the song my best friends are gay excuse.

185
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:25,060
There's no problem with this as it's normal show banter, but listeners who don't listen that often

186
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:31,460
may think it's because he is gay who knows. Thank you. I do like it. And you know,

187
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:37,380
cause it's cool to have a human being on the show. Oh, well, but it is because I'm hated by

188
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:44,900
that's why I'm a homophobic brother. Yeah, I know, I hear that. Yeah, I hear that. I hate all the

189
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:52,020
gays. But you want to meet Ali? No, to be fair, let's just clear the song. I don't give him. I don't have

190
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:57,460
care what your anybody's sexual orientation is. I really don't care. I do hate Alan, though.

191
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:03,540
Nothing to do with his gay. He was bisexual, stray, acesial. What bother me? The slide

192
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:10,100
is I still find them irritated with a huge ego. My final question is the statement that Chris

193
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:16,500
wears a little there. Again, which I think is untrue. The majority of time, it's Chris's guess

194
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:22,100
who swear on air not actually him. But again, the media headlines it so it sounds like he was a

195
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,900
one with the foul mouth. Well, there you have it Adam. You can make your mind up what you really think

196
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,620
Chris is like. I find it interesting that listeners who obviously don't listen to Chris's show

197
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:36,980
find it acceptable to comments on something that they don't listen to. I find that odd. Anyway,

198
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:42,220
this has been David Graham from Dorset England, who some of say has been corrupted by Chris

199
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:47,860
Mose. Grunge. Yeah, of course you're a scruncher. Not you're absolutely right. I don't know Chris

200
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:53,540
Mose. I've not listened to his show enough. So you've certainly given me a different perspective and I

201
00:21:53,620 --> 00:22:01,540
appreciate it. And I'm still watching. I'm a celebrity get me out of here, which I think is

202
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:07,860
four more nights. And David guessed lies in manellies of former husband is still in there. Boy,

203
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:14,260
what was I wrong about this guy? This guy is fucking funny. He's really funny and he's endearing

204
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:21,140
and he's very American at the same time. Not at all the liquid I thought he was. And you know,

205
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:30,740
and even through the lens of, even through the television camera, you know, you still end the

206
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:35,300
way. It's edited. You still don't really know what someone's like, but I certainly have a much better

207
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:42,740
idea. Well, here you go. Throw Chris Mose in the jungle. That's an idea. Hey, Minks, Genevieve

208
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,980
and I wanted to call you up and tell you the good news. Really? What's the world cast? Just cut

209
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,580
sign up at the pod show network. Yep. Just cut the contract in the mail today. Going to be at

210
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:56,340
a rope.potcho.com. Awesome. Did this be what I think it means? No, no, we're not changing anything.

211
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,820
Still covering all kinds of rope bondage. Thank you so much. I think she needs interviews with the

212
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:06,020
experts. Talk about politics and performance art and, of course, I'll still ask you both as the

213
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:12,500
official rope sluts to be my assistance. Thanks. I mean, yes, sir. But are we care about

214
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:21,460
if Adam Curry? Wait, Minks, you should see great answers. Thanks. No, don't tell me you signed

215
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:26,020
it without making it. But both of you, I couldn't very well demand exclusive bondage rights

216
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:30,660
to Adam Curry. Now, could I? Why not? Was it not what I've done? It's can't believe

217
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:35,620
let you talk to me to that where my, and then you, hey, you, you enjoyed that. Well, yeah, but

218
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,660
you promised me Adam Curry. You promised me Adam would. Hey, hey, we're not even really sure

219
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:46,020
he's actually kinky. Okay. That's just rumors. I don't care. Me either. You either get us

220
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,580
Adam Curry or you can take a rope cast and shove it up. All right. All right. Well, Adam,

221
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:55,540
you know where to find me. Great answer. And the rope cast at rope dot podshow dot com. No,

222
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:05,940
Adam Curry. Yes. Welcome to the network rope cast. Uh-huh. Now, I'm not, I'm kinky, but not

223
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:12,580
it. I'm not into rope at all, but I saw some of the pictures at rope dot podshow dot com.

224
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:18,900
I also found your hidden video cast. I wouldn't mind hanging out with you guys.

225
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,740
I can tie in or I pretty mean not a chic shank.

226
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,700
It's, you know, it's interesting. I said to the to Richard Brueh and Joe and our talent

227
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,700
department. I said, you know, I, I want an erotic a channel. I want, especially since it gets

228
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,820
no play on iTunes, I want a proper erotic a channel. Can I just say, I think the guys are

229
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:48,660
really, really delivering this time. Good job, boys. Good job. Okay.

230
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,380
Sadly, Windows now officially closed. It's just you and I, my friends and the juries.

231
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:33,700
Now I question anything. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not,

232
00:25:33,700 --> 00:26:03,700
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not,

236
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:46,380
You know, this kind of sounds like one of those songs that's running out of copywriting.

237
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:56,580
Yeah, the Jerry's and change your mind from the pod save music network.

238
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,980
I don't know what it is about those guys.

239
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,540
I played a different song by then earlier.

240
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,540
Was it Friday, maybe?

241
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,020
Remember what day?

242
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,220
Previous show.

243
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,140
I like him.

244
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,620
I really like the way they sound.

245
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,500
Uh, what was it going to say?

246
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,860
Oh, yeah.

247
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,460
I got a nice note and my checks back.

248
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:21,380
I tell you that from from the camera, the camera police who who snapped me,

249
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:26,780
speeding, they're saying that I have to get a UK equivalent license.

250
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:31,220
And then when I get the license, then I send the license in with my,

251
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,220
what is it?

252
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,980
120 pound fine with my check because it's two fines each, 60 pounds each.

253
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,260
Then they'll take off six points off of my license and pack to me.

254
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,780
So I'm like, and now, of course, since, you know, this has to happen within some,

255
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:49,980
I guess some agreeable amount of time, I'm already getting all kinds of, you know, legal

256
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,980
notices that I'm going to, basically going to jail is what's going to happen.

257
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,340
So I'm going to see if I can, if I can, I got a, I feel like shit today.

258
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:01,180
I got, I've been running a fever for two days, but sometimes this week I have to

259
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,980
have to take care of this, I have to get it done along with all the services that

260
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,420
have to be changed as we move to the new cottage.

261
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,340
I've got to get to bandwidth set up.

262
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,220
I've got to get to the sky, satellite TV set up.

263
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,380
Oh, man, this is just so much, it has to be done.

264
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,500
But that's just my personal life.

265
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,180
There's stuff to be done professionally as well.

266
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:30,140
Some good news regarding accessibility of podshow plus I'm so happy that someone

267
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,460
called in with this information.

268
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:40,700
Adam listening to 504 and just one thing that if we use in your text, this drawing or

269
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:48,420
your beautiful flash content, there is an accessibility panel where you can put

270
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:54,580
like shortcuts and tab in that description so that screen readers can actually interact

271
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:59,900
with a content, just sort of getting my sense of the show holder.

272
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,900
Thank you.

273
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,900
Thank you so much.

274
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,220
Okay, I'm all over this.

275
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:08,740
I had no idea I bet you the developers didn't know or weren't thinking about it.

276
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,740
This is great news.

277
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:16,220
And quite honestly, I could hardly imagine that Adobe, with its 98 or 99% penetration

278
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:21,380
of flash on all computers in the known universe, that they wouldn't have baked in some

279
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,380
accessibility stuff.

280
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,980
So apparently it's in there.

281
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,740
I will have the boys and girls look at it.

282
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,580
I promise you, let's get this done already, let's get this stuff working for people.

283
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:34,540
And this is where this was supposed to queue up, but there we go.

284
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:07,460
Yeah, what's up AC is, Jersey Todd, the official musicologist of the Chacha.

285
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,900
Hey listen, coming off the ton of blues of 35th birthday party last Friday, I had to bring

286
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,700
you a special midweek song to the Daily Source code, and I just had to get this song up

287
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,700
to you today.

288
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,100
I couldn't wait till Friday, the artist is Peter Mulvey out of Wisconsin.

289
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,780
His new album, The Nuckleball Sweet, well it's out on signature sounds.

290
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:27,020
And this is an artist that's been getting a lot of national press.

291
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,700
The songs are absolutely wonderful and I'm telling you, you got to check them out.

292
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,580
The song that I'm going to give you today, growing the high tops, is going to give

293
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,060
you a good kick in the ass for the middle of the week.

294
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:41,660
So go over to signature sounds website at www.signaturesounds.com, tell them to post more

295
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:45,340
of their artists of the Podsate music network, because they have got some absolutely amazing

296
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,660
people on their roster.

297
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:50,180
Hey, I'll see you guys on Friday, but right now this is Peter Mulvey on The Daily Source

298
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:50,460
Code.

299
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:09,980
Pretty young girl in my arms, is speaking of shelling to me.

300
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:16,780
I'm drinking beer, wine, I feel fine, I still may lose all the best I can to see.

301
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:25,460
I will lose all the best I can to see here.

302
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:33,180
I'll show you super places almost empty, barbed in this put-up of chairs, never been

303
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:40,620
song that was signed, it's gone on its way into the air, has gone on its way to the

304
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:51,900
air, gone, gone all the way, gone, every one on the way, gone to light on the air.

305
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:56,900
So go over to signature sounds website at www.signaturesounds.com, tell them to post more of
