16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

Can't stop all the rudders when it's really flowing

15
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,180
Break the sales something down in percent increase down low sales

16
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,680
You can't prevent satellite radio and video games

17
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,680
Change the terrain it will never be the same

18
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,180
Did you know in 10 years labels won't exist if I DVDs and compactists?

19
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,680
Hey Mr. Record man, what's wrong with you?

20
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,180
Still living up your cattle up from 1982

21
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,680
Hey Mr. Record man, your system tech compete

22
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,680
It's the new artist model, wild transfer

23
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,680
Break the sales

24
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,680

Down low the sales

27
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,680
You know, we just wanted to level playing fields

28
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
You've overcharged us from music for years

29
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,680
And now we're just trying to find a fair balance

30
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,680
I hate to say it, but

31
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,680
Welcome to the future

32
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,680

33
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,680
Down low the sales

34
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,680
Down low the sales

35
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,680
Hey Mr. Record man, what's wrong with you?

36
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,680
Down low the sales

37
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,680
And your label like it was 1990

38
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
Down low the sales

39
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,680

Down low the sales

48
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,680
And that's a lyric if I've heard one

49
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,680
It's the new artist model

50
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,680
A wild transfer complete

51
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

52
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
It's Friday, welcome to the last show for this trip

53
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
Coming to you from the Curry condo

54
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,680
Hey foggy San Francisco, yes we are back to normal

55
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,680
Time to go back to Blighty

56
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,680
Where it is still well into the 90s

57
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,680
Oh man, thank you so much everybody

58
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
For sending the music and that was from Josh English

59
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,680
Who's from Australia

60
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,680
You heard MC Lars

61
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
Download this song

62
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Apparently

63
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Been a pretty big hit

64
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
Down under

65
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,680
And he said we were going to set this to me

66
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,680
I think probably a week or two weeks ago

67
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
And I've just been holding on to it

68
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,680
And I was like yes, the perfect Friday for it

69
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,680
So last night this was going to be the big night out

70
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
It's me and our database

71
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
Dominatorics Aaron O'Neill

72
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
And as it turns out

73
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
They were more pod showers

74
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,680
We were going to go to the minks stole show

75
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,680
So yesterday after work

76
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,680
I think like 730 or something I left the office

77
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,680
I wanted to bring my stuff home

78
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
I had the car with me

79
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,680
Trinity of course cruise

80
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,680
I want to drop all my stuff off

81
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,680
I figured okay I'll call the cab

82
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,680
To take me over to the venue

83
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,680
And I'll just sit here and just

84
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,680
Just chill out for a couple of seconds

85
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,680
And so I didn't hear the cab call

86
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,680
That they had arrived downstairs

87
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,680
I didn't hear

88
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,680
At least four phone calls

89
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,680
From Aaron I think Chris Rockwell was there

90
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,680
And no in fact somewhere around 11 o'clock

91
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,680
I awoke because I do have some alarm set up

92
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
On some of the computers here

93
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,680
If there's something wrong with the pod show site

94
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,680
That shit did wake me up

95
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
I was dead

96
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
I was out

97
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
I was completely gone

98
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
Didn't hear anything

99
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,680
Except of course

100
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,680
The one thing my ears trained to

101
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,680
It's like something wrong with the site

102
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,680
Top row and said we gotta go check it out

103
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,680
So I don't have any cool stories about last night

104
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,680
If you like such a dick and wait until I get to the office

105
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,680
I'm going to be ridiculed all day

106
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,680
And I'm sure about it

107
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,680
So no good stories to report I guess

108
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
Then from our evening out

109
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
Maybe I can tell you all about what

110
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,680
Everyone what kind of trouble everybody got into

111
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,680
When I'm back home with the cottage

112
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,680
And bring you the Monday show

113
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,680
Yes, they did hear Mark Yoshimoto

114
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
Nemkoff on Pacific Coast LW

115
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,680
I was insanely jealous

116
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
I mean talk about songs

117
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,680
You'd love to play on a Friday

118
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,680
He rolled out Andrew Gold's lonely boy

119
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,680
Which of course is not pod safe

120
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,680
But oh Andrew Gold is a personal friend of his

121
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,680
So it was completely okay

122
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,680
I'm like oh man

123
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
Ah

124
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,680
That's I mean lonely boy is such a beautiful

125
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,680
Actually that's a song you want to kick a Friday off with

126
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,680
But since I don't I can't count Andrew Gold is one of my personal friends

127
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,680
You know that Patricia and I we have a couple of songs

128
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,680
That are you know how you have a song that is your song

129
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,680
Or yeah, it's our song one of them

130
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,680
Is a never let her slip away another fantastic Andrew Gold track

131
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,680
It would be cool to play that on Monday hand hint

132
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,680
Even cooler if if the lyric would be

133
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,680
Instead of a talk to my baby on the telephone long distance

134
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,680
You can see why this is our song right?

135
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
Because we do a lot of talking long distance

136
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,680
Wouldn't it be cool if

137
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,680
I should I pay for this if I could get Andrew Gold to re-cut that just that

138
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
For first opening line and say

139
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,680
I talked to Patricia on the telephone long distance

140
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,680
Oh man, oh man, would I have some super sex if I made that happen

141
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,680
Ha ha

142
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Speaking of Mark Yoshimo to Nemko have you heard of this?

143
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
I didn't even know he was doing this show

144
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,680
I'd heard about it. I'd heard about that he'd written

145
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,680
He'd written the show or written parts of it or I don't know if he was supposed to be a book

146
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Or what it was

147
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,680
It's a podcast called Where's my fucking latte?

148
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,680
And it's about public personal assistance and Hollywood and the stories that they've shared

149
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,680
You've got to check this show out of course

150
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,680
I'll put a link into the show notes on that daily source code.com

151
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,680
I think he's up to episode nine

152
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,680
I couldn't believe it tonight

153
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,680
I've I've synced that up into a channel

154
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,680
I've put all of them onto my iPod for the trip home

155
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,680
I cannot I cannot wait to hear every single episode of where the fuck is my latte?

156
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,680
You're on her, I'd like to make a motion to rock this mother out

157
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,680
You're on her, please don't bang that gavel

158
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,680
You can try this cowbell out

159
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Let's all give a nod

160
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,680
To the hardest work in law here

161
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,680
It's just inside the bag

162
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,680
It's just inside the bag

163
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,680
You're on her, what do you say?

164
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,680
He might even live in this case

165
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
Characters inside

166
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,680
Yeah, yeah, it was Characters inside

167
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,680
Oh, it was Characters inside

168
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,680
Show of now

169
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,680
It was Characters inside

170
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,680
Oh, yeah, I don't hate it

171
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,680
It's the toughest

172
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,680
Yo, what's up, Adam?

173
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,680
It's Characters inside

174
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,680
Hey, and between trying case all week and preparing my debut on serious stars

175
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,680
One or two for this Monday night

176
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
It has been a hell of a week

177
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,680
And on her voice, I've read down the Jersey Todd Show dot com

178
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,680
And Jersey Todd Show dot pot show dot com websites

179
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
May not have earned a simple lawyer like me a 10-4-0 hat

180
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,680
But man, after this week

181
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,680
I have definitely got my 10-4-0 being on

182
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,680
Look, the quote James Brown, ain't no pain killer

183
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
It's a body thriller

184
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,680
I gotta tell you, I am really pumped up

185
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,680
The pot show is chosen to include the Jersey Todd Show in its lineup

186
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,680
I look forward to doing your proud

187
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,680
And I really thank you for the opportunity

188
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,680
But hey, look, it's Friday

189
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,680
And I don't know what you want to kick off the weekend right

190
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,680
So, I'm bringing you to the band lines in the street from Vancouver Canada

191
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,680
They've been called by Magnet Magazine

192
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,680
What the stones were and what the Dandy Warhol should have been

193
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,680
So from the PMN, this is the band lines in the street

194
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,680
With mine ain't yours

195
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
Rock on

196
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,680
Rock on Jersey Todd official musicologist of the Charlie

197
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,680
Cranking it out

198
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,680
Now

199
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,680
I'll feel free to turn it off for some

200
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,680
Can't know as much people in here here

201
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,680
Rock it

202
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,680
It's a last chance to rain

203
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,680
Take all down on me

204
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,680
Let us know, take it

205
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,680
My yours, take it

206
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,680
Now you're late

207
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,680
Who's going on with me, though

208
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,680
Your life's much better

209
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,680
My name's yours, take it

210
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,680
And we're now making it right

211
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,680
But how long can you grow

212
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,680
Don't try to sing

213
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
Same old song

214
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,680
Never try to make it right

215
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,680
Still without long until you go

216
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,680
Never try to see it out of my head

217
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,680
I was looking for a place to hide

218
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,680
Let us know, take it

219
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,680
My yours, take it

220
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,680
Let us chance to rain

221
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,680
Take all down on me

222
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,680
Let us know, take it

223
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,680
My yours, take it

224
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,680
Now you're late

225
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,680
Who's going on with me, though

226
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,680
Your life's much better

227
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,680
My yours, take it

228
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,680
Never try to make it right

229
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,680
But how long can you grow

230
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,680
Don't try to sing

231
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
Same old song

232
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,680
Never try to make it right

233
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,680
Still without long until you go

234
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,680
Never try to see it out of my head

235
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,680
You're always looking for a place to hide

236
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,680
Let us know, take it

237
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,680
My yours, take it

238
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:15,680
Never try to make it right

239
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,680
Never try to make it right

240
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,680
Making it right for them out of getting me wrong

241
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,680
Don't try to sing the same old song

242
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,680
Every time making advice to me how long till you go

243
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,680
Never try to sing it out of mind

244
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,680
I always love you more to play tonight

245
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,680
That is how we make it

246
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,680
Mind your taking

247
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,680
Minds of the street, thanks to the official music colleges of the Charlie jersey Todd

248
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,680
Podsafe music on the daily source code

249
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,680
You know if you're listening to the show in an MP3 player that recognizes album art

250
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,680
So for instance iTunes does that or your iPod will do that

251
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,680
You'll see today we have a nice picture of a naked monkey

252
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,680
And the reason I bring this up is twofold one is because

253
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,680
Bridget at the office

254
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,680
I don't know what she's listening to the show in

255
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,680
But she came to me yesterday and said oh you know that picture you put in there

256
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,680
That's a I could put in some picture on yesterday's show of some project or working on just like a little teaser thing

257
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,680
And she said oh that's the wrong version

258
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
And I said well I can't go change it now

259
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,680
Everyone already has the show you know just leave it be

260
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,680
You know send me something different you know send me a certain you different picture to put in there. It's fun

261
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,680
I like it when people see it's another part of the mashup that I make is the picture that goes along in the album art

262
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,680
And she said well what's that same to you and of course the standard answer is well naked pictures obviously

263
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,680
So she sent me the picture of the naked monkey

264
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,680
But I was thinking you know we have this new system at pod show. It's not rolled out. Yeah, but if you look across podshow dot com you'll see

265
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,680
Art work for almost every single podcast of the podcast doesn't have art

266
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,680
Then I think it gets a default like headphone head logo

267
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:39,680
But that album art is pretty much what everyone displays and it's taken from your feed from your podcast feed

268
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,680
And it really doesn't change that much, but I know a lot of people I do it. I know Donna Drew does it. You know they change the album art

269
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,680
Which is cool because when you're actually listening to the song

270
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,680
You know you can there's some context there

271
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,680
So Andrew Grummit has come up with some fabulous system

272
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:02,680
That will enable us to actually rotate the art along with what is the current picture that's in the most recent MP3 file

273
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,680
So what an opportunity right there

274
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,680
If I put a picture in then anywhere daily source code is displayed on podshow dot com

275
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,680
Not just when you're playing it, but anywhere it's displayed that picture will pop up as well

276
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,680
So I'm thinking

277
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,680
Yeah, you got it

278
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
Make a picture

279
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,680
Hi Adam is Carl again

280
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:29,680
Look I know the topic of scrunching and coding is well and true over. I just thought like you know you've actually missed out a section of people

281
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:36,680
I don't know if I'm any plastic on the planet that does this which I'm not but I represent this third party

282
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,680
Adam

283
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,680
I'm a shower

284
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,680
Since I was a small boy, I've never actually used toilet paper after doing my business

285
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,680
I simply hop off the toilet

286
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,680
Jumping the shower

287
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,680
Apply some shampoo to the hand and rub it through the bottle

288
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,680
This gets rid of all the mess with my thoughts

289
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,680
And there's just a hell of a lot easier

290
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,680
I don't know if I'm any person that does this, I don't care if I am

291
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,680
And that's kind of hygienic kind of nasty

292
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,680
But I just thought like you know, so I'll finish this

293
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,680
This will come into with shower

294
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Do thank you

295
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,680
Thank you so much for the information really appreciate that

296
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,680
Yeah, that works but not when you live in multiple times don't you know you're not always on the same schedule

297
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,680
This is

298
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,680
Something sent to me Jeff, Jeff Hins, it's for the summer

299
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,680
Little D on the chart

300
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,680
We'll go back with her legs and tits out

301
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,680
Some roof down, some shades and shits on

302
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,680
So make them off because by November we've got them back to the windows

303
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
No, the sun will wait for

304
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,680
Stop with the shit to the end of April

305
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,680
So not complain when it's cold or too hot

306
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,680
Just be grateful for what you've done

307
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,680
Because there's nothing you can do about the weather my friends

308
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,680
So make the most of an unexpected hot weekend

309
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,680
We've been summertime, blazing, blazing, blazing

310
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,680
You know this is the summer of the summer

311
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,680
You know that we will go away

312
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,680
This is summer time and it's the way it goes

313
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,680
You know this is the summer time, summer time, summer time

314
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,680
Summer time, summer time

315
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,680
This is summer time, summer having a lot

316
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,680
I'm smoking weed when it's heaping over the park

317
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,680
I'm not leaving until the sun goes down

318
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
Or until the sun goes down

319
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,680
You decide to stay around, I could drown

320
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,680
In the amount of cider I've drawn today

321
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,680
He's don't matter because it's a lazy Sunday

322
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,680
I've got bedtime to waste and the sun's a blaze

323
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,680
We decided to move the party over to a late place

324
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,680
On the way, over there grab a couple more

325
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,680
Great ton of girlfriends and a few with inmates

326
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,680
So look you fine, two don't hire in the central page

327
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,680
Time we decided to get in date

328
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,680
And it's time to die, keep the girls occupied with

329
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,680
What was a wine ignite the pub

330
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,680
The tuning to eat something

331
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,680
Been drinkings in two in the afternoon

332
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,680
So that the sun is going down and up and see the moon

333
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,680
Pities over soon

334
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,680
But there's lots to come, every weekend

335
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,680
In the summer sunday sun

336
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,680
To the summer time, ladies and ladies

337
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,680
Don't praise me, you know

338
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,680
This is the summer time

339
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,680
You know that we will go

340
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
To the way and fall

341
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,680
This is summer time, and this is the way

342
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,680
It goes, you know

343
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,680
This is summer time, summer time

344
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,680
Summer time, summer time, summer time

345
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,680
Summer time, summer time

346
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,680
Go walk a first thing on the sunday

347
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,680
I've been loon' cause the sun's short

348
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,680
From a curtain to lit up my room

349
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,680
I roll down my pit to view the world from my window

350
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,680
Who's giving me inspiration for my personally single

351
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,680
Cleared blue skies in the mid 20s

352
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,680
Still on the rise, the pub began to meet my clicking

353
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,680
Get high, we drag slow to the park

354
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,680
To smoke somebody kick a moor about

355
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,680
Check out the fibbons, cause that's what summer's all about

356
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,680
Ladies walk around the town

357
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,680
In next nothing, showing off their plans

358
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,680
Cause, yeah, rules are lovely

359
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,680
Not as much as I love my own garden

360
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,680
In the summer, cause my neighbors don't stop

361
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
Isn't that too loose?

362
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
Stunner, and she's some makes toilet

363
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,680
Super void wet masks

364
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,680
To mess the only time

365
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,680
Over-shops like to cut the grass

366
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
When the sun shines down

367
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,680
Bleed your head and then relax

368
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,680
And make sure the volume on your get to blast

369
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,680
A little max, so enjoy your while you can

370
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
And open another big

371
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,680

372
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,680

This is summer time

378
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,680
And this is the way it goes

379
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,680
In the summer summer time

00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,680
Summer time

381
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,680
Summer time

382
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,680
Summer time

383
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,680
Well, those yellow ones

384
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
We don't know who Jeff Hintz

385
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,680
He doesn't know who Jeff Hintz is

386
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
He does the friday night dance party party party party party

387
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
I think his name is

388
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:21,840
He does the Friday night dance party podcast. So it was actually emails have given all the talk of the DSC about the British Summer World

389
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,600
The ladies show off their stuff. He just got to play summertime by little D

390
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:32,360
He's been playing it since May it was voted the theme song for summer 2006 by listeners of the Friday night dance party

391
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:39,080
I gotta say I'm chairman on very cool and I like the way it ends nice a abrupt fade out there

392
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,840
Did I miss something? Oh, whatever

393
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:49,040
Hey, let's time to check in with the the Troy needs an iPod dot com contest

394
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,960
Remember, this is an unofficial contest void wear print of a buy by law and of course

395
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,040
I'm the final judge and I don't give a care. I don't give rats ass what you say

396
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,640
I determined who's going to win the video iPod and

397
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,280
And I've asked you to put entries for this into the comments at daily source code dot com. Thank you

398
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,120
Finally people are getting it. Let me just bring up the

399
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:16,400
Oh wait a minute for this be the satellite repair man coming in with a message. I just sent an SMS text message to

400
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:27,040
To PW Fenton saying hey man, can I make a 49er for the satellite window today? I'd love to because we got like two and a half minutes left on on the satellite window

401
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,240
And I got so many more cool tunes to play and so much more fun stuff

402
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,400
I want the serious one or two listeners to be able to

403
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
participate

404
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Let's take a look at the

405
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,520
Troy needs an iPod dot com. Do you remember this started out with

406
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,480
Troy needing an iPod trying to raise money through Troy needs an iPod dot com and then

407
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,280
Other one start other don't here we go. This is Peter. Let's see what he says. Oh my second

408
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
You can hear the buzz and then we get the

409
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,720
Yep, that would mean

410
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
crap

411
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,960
Okay, sorry satellite folks

412
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,040
You're not getting a 49er today. You're getting another minute and 41 seconds

413
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,400
So anyway, so this contest just started to spin out of control. I thought since we have this go daddy

414
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,680
Campaign running where you can get a domain name for $6.95

415
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,000
Sance by using checkout code dsc3

416
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,360
I said you know what the hey that's a that's a pretty good investment

417
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,800
You know why don't you register a domain name it doesn't even have to be with go daddy quite honestly

418
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,560
I really don't care where you register it

419
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,320
And let's see what the most original entries are so I'm just gonna run down the list here

420
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
This is from the buckets

421
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,320
What you really need is a job dot com which will soon be pointing to monster dot com. That's pretty good

422
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,440
This is St. Maz

423
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:53,360
Patricia support of Spammer's means she means I have Patricia's support of Spammer's means I have to use

424
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,080

425
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,200

432
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,480

435
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,120
Okay, okay

436
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,400
The iPod that launched 1000 shows dot com and that points to pod show dot com as Bob Evans

437
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:12,240
Pretty interesting how about this one this whole competition is just a desperate try to sell more domains with go daddy to please our advertisers dot com very good one

438
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Very very very very awesome

439
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,680
I want Adam credit to give me an iPod, but I will accept donations from anyone dot com

440
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:27,920
He just gets better and Troy actually pipes back in with I got digged at the show and all I got was this lousy iPod dot com

441
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,640
How come no one's registered scruncher dot com I can't I don't understand was that taken

442
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:41,200
I know we had scruncher a folder, but okay keep sending them in sometime next week. I promise you

443
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,520
At this point I'm not even sure that you know one prize will

444
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,520
We'll do it because crap man. There's so many good entries

445
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,320
Enter yours at daily source code dot com. I guess sometime next week we'll we'll announce the winner and

446
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:01,120
There's certainly will be at least one prize which is the the video iPod crap crap

447
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,440
I was talking so much about the domains and miss the entire satellite window

448
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,920
ah

449
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:19,680
Yesterday I was talking about how weird it is to buy a house in the UK you know Patricia's been trying to to purchase a cottage for us

450
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,920
And and we have to go through this whole closed seal envelope bidding process

451
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:31,360
Which I've never never witnessed before my life and I like is this the way it works in the UK

452
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:39,360
And of course I gave out the daily source code voicemail numbers in New Jersey plus one for the US

453
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:47,840
2016256357 or our London number plus four four two zero seven six eight one three seven five three

454
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,800
And then I get some responses. Yes, sure. I did are they consistent? Hell no

455
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,240
Hi, I'm long time listener James here. I was just walking back from the under motor show

456
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,240
Listening to the DSC and I hear you're having problems with the UK property market

457
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,320
As it happens, it's by coincidence my family are buying a house on the Epsom Road moment

458
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,880
Which I think is just around the corner for me

459
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
Continue with the trick is research

460
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,000
We haven't to know that the house has been on the market for four months

461
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,440
Which is a long time for a property in this

462
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:27,200
After and sorry suburb and we also know that the current owners have a property. They already can move into

463
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,920
So because of this

464
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,960
All offer is 800 rather than a 50 or a 60

465
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
Which is what they're asking

466
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,680
But our chance is a further increase by being able to say that our house is under off and now

467
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,080
So the whole thing can be done and dusted if they accept

468
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,720
Yeah, you know actually we did try that

469
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,280
Patricia did say hey look we don't have anything to sell

470
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,680
You know we're just we can move right out of that rental and we can hand you money whenever

471
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,800
Told you she was there with a checkbook, so but that didn't seem to impress the vendors

472
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,160
Which isn't the second century because that's the thing you're selling

473
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,120
The old thing are these kind of values

474
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,240
The asking prices never the price you pay for

475
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,680
If it's on the market and there's lots of interest

476
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:16,640
Then you can pay out a 50,000 pounds more or if there's not been much interest and it's been on the market for a while

477
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,320
The same amount to be taken off

478
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,360
If you need any more help, I'll drop any mail. See you have my address

479
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,560
Thing is I'm in the area. I love the show keep up the good work. Bye all right

480
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,160
So it sounds like it's a pretty normal procedure. I thank you for the lesson economics

481
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,960
Yes, I know if there's a lot of demand then the price goes up and if there's not a lot of demand then the price probably goes down a little bit

482
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,920
But it sounded like they're you were talking in the age in the in the in the price range of

483
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,880
850,000 pounds which is like 1.7 million dollars if you can believe that

484
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:56,640
And that you could expect to pay 50,000 pounds over that price. So that is what that's like

485
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
4% am I saying that right

486
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,680
No

487
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,680
It's more than it's like

488
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,480
Crap six percent

489
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,440
Okay, so be prepared to pay that if there's a hope. I mean, how do you know if there's a whole bunch of interest

490
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,440
How do you know when these guys say well, you know we already have several offers in

491
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,440
But you know are the offers lower or higher?

492
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,800
This is confused. I just want to buy the house just tell me what the damn price is

493
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,560
I Adam it's the Adrian Pack here a lot of listener since April 2005 now

494
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,400
From the UK. I'm just a comment about your cottageing

495
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
Firstly the

496
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,120
That's not the normal way to buy a house in UK. I mean the way you describe it with a

497
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,480
An asking price and then making an offer which is probably the same in pretty much

498
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,480
Every other country is the usual way to buy most properties, but there are other ways in the UK

499
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,000
And I'm sure there's a

500
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,040
State agent's listening it can explain this better than I can but

501
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:00,720
I suppose in the end it's up to the personal selling the property. How they want to do it and how they think they're going to make the most money out of it

502
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,280
And the way that that's the one you're looking at

503
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,160
It's being sold looks like

504
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,560
It doesn't mean you're going to have to decide how much you're prepared to pay for it and put that video in those for the best

505
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,640
And you know that's the way they're going to make most money. I guess and I don't you do the same when you sell it on

506
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,880
That's it really from me just to say that I don't have my own podcast so I've got nothing to promote

507
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,280
So I'm going to promote one of the one I'm releasing to this comment is sponsored by

508
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,880
Let's see

509
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,880
clever little pod

510
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,040
little pod calm

511
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,680
Nice work. Thanks a lot. Bye

512
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,840
Almost perfect if I were to say what is the what is a perfect comment when you send it into the daily source code?

513
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,040
It is by saying who you are where you're from?

514
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,440
referencing what you're calling about

515
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,080
putting your comment in and then yes indeed

516
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,880
indeed promoting a

517
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,920
Promoting a show that you listen to

518
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,760
Not your own show promoting a show that you listen to he doesn't have a show which I'd like that much more

519
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,960
I'd love it when listeners call in the only thing you could have done to make it perfect was to wind up with

520
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,960
the folder scruncher

521
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,960
I had a big full

522
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
full of them

523
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,960
from one

524
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
Well, I'm a pressing lawyer

525
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,000
20 odd years

526
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,240
You know, this is why you need to write down those voicemail numbers because this is exactly what happens

527
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:27,760
You're in the car, you're on your bike, you're walking, you're in the bus, the train, whatever it is

528
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,400
You're listening to the show and then you hear something and you want to respond immediately and that's why

529
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,760
You know the mobile phone is such a fantastic device for it

530
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,080
So pre-program those numbers in your phone, please you can find them

531
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
Write in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com

532
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
What a level nonsense

533
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,560
And that's actually not the way that things are usually done at all

534
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,360
They just don't even much more orders fashion

535
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:05,360
It's nonsense to sell bits and they've got somebody who's got the head sticking with their bears

536
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,400
But I don't know if something I don't know I do want to remind you

537
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,440
And it's a bar's market at the moment Adam unless this is something really special

538
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,640
I can't honestly I would hold on a second, Paul

539
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,360
A buyer's market. I don't think it's a buyer's market in guilt for dude

540
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,920
I mean houses are being snapped up left and right

541
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:30,720
I think it's definitely still a seller's market witness all the interest for this particular house and

542
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,760
Unfortunately, of course it's something special

543
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,080
You can get some great bargains at the moment you really can

544
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,920
Anyway, I'm a proper lawyer. I'm not one of those

545
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,600
Pongers, but not like Jersey Todd, you mean

546
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,840
South Hades is a cool conveyance

547
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm a bloke that actually goes to court and gets you hamster thing

548
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,880
So I'm one of the real real lawyers

549
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,160
But if you think the

550
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,440
The purchase is silly you wait and see that's gets with the process you've got

551
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,960
Search is that you're going to do you got to work at the lamps for a whole lease hole those

552
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,360
Registres to tackle and register time alarm

553
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,160
It really is it's like some weird odd game of clues that

554
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,320
There we are anyway

555
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,640
Hope you spot too painful. See you night. Bye bye. No, everybody. Thank you very much. I appreciate it

556
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,960
I'm Jersey Todd. I'm just kidding man. I know you're for real. In fact, I might actually need you

557
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,360
I'm looking at this piece of paper here

558
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,600
From the building important notice dear owner slash resident

559
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:57,120
The Metropolitan Association has received numerous complaints regarding smoke slash cooking odors permanent permeating from unit to unit

560
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,800
Attempts by Howard S. Wright to diagnose this problem have been unsuccessful

561
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,520
The association is keeping a running log of all smoke slash odor related incidents

562
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,040
We hope to identify all affected units and possibly and possible causes of this problem

563
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,880
to report an incident police in the near mail to smoke smell reporting at yahoo.com

564
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,040
Oh shit. I shouldn't have told you that

565
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:26,240
I wonder if it's really just are they smelling cooking smells or you don't you don't think it could be

566
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960
It could be anything else now. Do you

567
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:38,000
I have a question for you about biodiesel a couple of weeks ago. I discovered a biodiesel gas station

568
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,160
Just three miles from my house. I'm so excited

569
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,360
We drive a diesel VW. So of course I wanted to check it out. I've been filling up there ever since

570
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:50,000
It bucks me though that it's only be 20 20 percent bio and 80 percent petroleum

571
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,720
20 percent is better than nothing of course, but why is it at a hundred percent? I know you've done the research

572
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:01,520
So I'm hoping you could explain it. Thank you, pod father. Oh, Kelly. Oh, I love it when you say pod father. Thank you, pod father

573
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,640
She says that in my dreams, too

574
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,400
Cali normally I would have rolled out the Trinity theme tune, but I forgot

575
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:17,040
So a good question. Yeah, there is a difference between what Trinity is running on and what you're putting into your brand new diesel by the way

576
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,040
I commend you. That's fantastic

577
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:27,280
And of course B20 is a good start and an exactly what it is. It's 20 percent vegetable oil and 80 percent petroleum-based diesel oil

578
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,440
And the reason for that is really just the production

579
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,480
It's you know, we don't have huge facilities cranking out gallons and gallons of the shit by the second so

580
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:46,320
You know, it's really the I think that there's also the supply may be you know that the raw materials because you know

581
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,560
Basically the stuff that that I get here in San Francisco, you know, it's literally collected from restaurants and it's all you know

582
00:35:52,560 --> 00:36:00,320
It's vegetable oil is being thrown out that was you know cooking oil essentially it goes through a fairly simple process before you can put it into your tank

583
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,720
And the bio fuel OASIS does that in in was they in in Berkeley and

584
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,720
You know, so the best thing to do would be to set something up

585
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,640
With some of the other diesel drivers in the neighborhood and you know set up a little community

586
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,680
I think this is you know, it's so hard to create massive quantities of anything and that's why refineries

587
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,800
You know there are refineries now being built around the world that will cost anywhere from four to eight billion dollars

588
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,440
I mean this refinery business is not trivial for to eight billion dollars and it's usually not owned by

589
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:39,280
By you know by one oil company, but multiple oil companies because of the expense it's so incredibly large

590
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,120
Now of course they're making so much profit. What did what was the profit

591
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,520
Announcement yesterday ten billion dollars for one company the second highest every in the history of oil companies

592
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,280
You know, so that's that's that's pretty astounding

593
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:00,960
So I would recommend that you know if you're really into it and and you really want to mess around with it

594
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,760
You get one of these kits, you know for like a thousand bucks or fifteen hundred bucks and you can go around to the

595
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,000
You know your local Chinese restaurant twice a week and you could fill up a

596
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,040
You could drive for a month

597
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,760
With five cars on that amount depending on how big the Chinese restaurant is of course

598
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:24,560
So that's really the difference Cali and and that is the groupy thing about biodiesel is even if you're running on 100% biodiesel and you're running to a jam

599
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:32,000
You can pretty much throw anything in there and it'll work and this is what the diesel engine was designed for wasn't designed for patrolling and base stuff

600
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,000
hey wait a minute um Cali was on

601
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,800
MSNBC yesterday wasn't she yeah hold on a second let me

602
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,840
Shoot let me see if I can bring up she said she was gonna put it on the show

603
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,600
Let me bring up geek brief for a second let's see if we can see how she did on MSNBC

604
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:56,400
I know that the show she was on was going to be with Allison Stewart which is really fun because Allison Stewart used to be a

605
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:04,080
Associate producer at MTV which basically means you have a producer and the producer would stand next to the VJ

606
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:09,360
While you were doing segments and would make sure of course that everything is you know that you're announcing the right video and

607
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,920
With my producers we'd always go through what I was gonna say and we'd prep it a day ahead of time and the Associate producer is

608
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,960
Kind of well at MTV in the day you were certainly more a go for than anything else

609
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,320
But then she slowly moved over into the news department where I think she was very well suited and before you knew it

610
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,800
She was on air and she was doing MTV news

611
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,520
I did a couple of a couple of shows with her the weekend rock. I did that a few times with a lovely girl

612
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,760
And very very proud of what she's done her careers just moved into well

613
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,720
G the big leagues

614
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,480
Doesn't mean that she completely understands what we're doing

615
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:52,800
But hopefully canlly did a good job of explaining. Let's let's check in. Let's see. Oh shoot hold on

616
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,800
I'm not hearing this

617
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,200
Something must be wrong hold on

618
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,680
crap. Why is this not working?

619
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,560
Oh, man

620
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,560
Play

621
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,640
Shoot hold on a second. Oh, you know what happened fire fight. This is the new fire fox

622
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,440
Just crashed. Let's see if I can get rid of this all right you know what I'll do I'll wait for that to

623
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,920
I'll wait for fire fox to restart and I'll play this in the meantime

624
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:38,160
Hi, this is Lockjaw host of the podcast junkie show

625
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,080
If you're as tired as I am of all the crap to corporate media giants are trying to force me to you on the radio

626
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,360
Head on over to the podcast junkie.com

627
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:54,320
Were you here music come independent artists over view of other podcasts and whatever else I feel like throwing your way

628
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,560
Join the revolution today with Lockjaw the podcast junkie

629
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,880
Music by all my fault so they're available on the podcast music network

630
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,400
Okay, so I think I figured it out what happened was fire foxed one of those automatic updates

631
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,880
Which I really don't like it. I'm sure there's a setting forward, but it's I feel it's so wrong

632
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:26,480
When when software does that, you know because there's so many things that you know that can happen in the background

633
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,000
Why is my computer slow? Why is it not running you know why did I see the disc light going on?

634
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,760
It turns out that fire fox is saying they're downloading everything in the background and and then you know halfway through

635
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:44,880
Well, I had everything all queued up everything all teed up then it wants to restart fire fox. You know this is not this is not the this is not good

636
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,120
Okay, so I've fired it back up. I got into my channels. I went to my

637
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,840
My tech video channel which you can also access by the way if you go to atom.podshow.com and

638
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,040
Let's see there we go. Okay, so we got Callie. So this is from yesterday's MSNBC

639
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:10,160
And I had not looked at this so well hopefully it'll be fun to kind of listen to it together and see if that works. Here we go

640
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,160
It is one of the most popular forms of new media and it's called podcasting think of it as

641
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:21,600
Portable entertainment and information on demand and podcast well they can be created by anyone

642
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:27,280
honest Callie Lewis gets more than six million hits per month on her program

643
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:34,160
Geek brief TV hit the video podcast download all about technology so who better to ask about the basics of

644
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,280
podcasting and Callie just for the record there there are two types of podcasts, right?

645
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,960
Yeah, there's good ones in bad ones audio or you can do video just like radio or TV

646
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,960
All right, you say you can just do them

647
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,960
How do you just do them?

648
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,040
So for a simple it really is and it's very inexpensive

649
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:01,200
For audio all you need is a computer a microphone some headphones and some

650
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,200
Recording software for audio what I would suggest is to use cast-blaths

651
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,760
Callie go Callie

652
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:18,080
And has everything you need to be able to publish a show and Geek brief TV is actually a video podcast

653
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,000
Oh, you got to look at this. She looks so cute. She's a via via remote

654
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,440
Looks like she's coming in from is that the Dallas studio

655
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:35,040
And so the the caption on the screen read podcasting offers portable news and entertainment on demand and we use an application called video Q Pro

656
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:41,440
Again, it's super simple. It has everything we need it has a teleprompter we can do green screen effects

657
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,920
We can put title graphics. I think you fancy TV people call it what?

658
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Cairon, there you go

659
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,280
And they're doing a split screen

660
00:42:53,680 --> 00:43:01,120
Well, we started December 23rd which was what six months ago seven months ago and we the first time we heard a podcast

661
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,720
We knew we had to do one because it was so addictive and so compelling

662
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,560
So we just started and we had no video production experience at all. We don't know what the heck we were doing

663
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,960
So we just started to see what we could do and

664
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,120
Within three months or three weeks. You know, it's interesting because that is true when they first started out

665
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,120
They really were just trying to do whatever they could do

666
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,840
Cali and and the invisible kneel

667
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,880
And now that they've actually quit their day job and are doing it full time the quality

668
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,080
Predominantly forget this the quality of of the video and the editing and the green screen and and all the stuff they're doing

669
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:41,600
But the editorial is great and and they're getting all kinds of great gadgets. I mean really I think

670
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:47,280
This is you know that between the stories they're doing they have a great mix between

671
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,600
Yeah, I'd have to say between a gadget and rocket boom and of course Holly beat

672
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,560
Cali be much hotter than

673
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,200
Anybody on either of those shows

674
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:04,480
Actually we had 3,000 viewers we were getting shut down by our hosting company because

675
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,440
We exceeded our bandwidth limit and then we saved you. I pleaded to a company called pods

676
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,880
Yes, help me back from running and this is my big question to you

677
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,880
This is my big question

678
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,880
Is Adam Curry really a big-haired fag?

679
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,120
Right after I make my podcast my audio or video one how do I get it out to the world?

680
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,520
Oh, well, I is a

681
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,520
Website called pod showed up

682
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,760
And they made very easy to

683
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,720
To do it without understanding any of the technology behind it which has been the hardest part for the past two years

684
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,880
Because you had to understand the technology but now you don't all you have to do is sign up

685
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,560
All right, so go to geek brief

686
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,640
Geek brief TV. I'll put a link in the show notes and go check out the entire interview

687
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:53,760
That's pretty cool the the funniest thing about all this is you know here. I am playing all this for you this

688
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:01,280
This stuff from MSNBC and in in all reality. I think more people are

689
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:08,320
Listening or more people are watching Cali show around the globe then actually will ever see

690
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,960
For see that interview. I had a miss pool park incident from podcast user magazine in the flashing 12 podcast

691
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:20,480
Adam I'm running an ask on the reverse engineers this month in the August edition which comes out on the first of August

692
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,240
But I'm also trying to run one on black lab and I'm catching up on some DSCs

693
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,840
I've been away for a couple of weeks on business and I heard that you're meeting up with a guy some black lab on Friday in the office

694
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,760
And could you ask them to get in touch with me? I've left them a number of messages at

695
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,320
Contacts at blacklabworld.com

696
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:41,680
But I've not heard anything back from them. So if you give them a nods. I'd really appreciate it love what you're doing on the

697
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,680
DSC I've got a ton of things about

698
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,480
Brits the anchors is the great so I'll do a proper all year coming on that

699
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,120
So look forward to seeing you sometime. Thanks a lot keep up the good work. Cheers night. Bye bye. Sure Paul

700
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,520
Well in that interesting so yeah, I actually had I almost forgotten that today we

701
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,400
During our food bar Friday, which is a tradition at Pod Show around

702
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:09,200
Was it four o'clock five o'clock and you have to knew we just stopped work and and then there's always a presentation or something fun going on and today indeed

703
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,200
We will

704
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:18,080
We'll have an acoustic set. I'm not sure if if I'm not exactly sure who's coming but let's just say an acoustic black lab set

705
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,840
And yeah, of course, I'll put it in a nudge for you there Paul

706
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,320
But if you left contact numbers everywhere and it's about an interview you know and someone ignores you

707
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,080
Maybe it's because they don't want to be interviewed. Hey Adam. This is Neil from the pod safe revolution podcast

708
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,520
Now Jersey Todd's the official musicologist of your show. I'm sticking my claim right now is the official pod safe

709
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,680
Revolutionary of the Charlie

710
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,720
There's a band coming at a new jersey called the new London fire

711
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,000
Their debut albums currently only available for pre-order. It's not actually hitting the streets until the 8th of August

712
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:55,200
But I haven't talking with their label now for over two months and yeah, you guessed it these guys are part of our revolution

713
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,440
These guys are now officially pod safe

714
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:03,360
And not only a pod guest who's getting the single before the albums released we're getting it before radio gets it

715
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,000
Yeah, it's gonna be up on the pod safe music network tomorrow

716
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,960
But I just wanted to make sure that when these guys blow up people are gonna be able to save

717
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,120
They hurt at first on a daily source code

718
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,360
Cheers man have a good Friday and a folder scruncher. No, okay. I do thank you so much

719
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,120
It's interesting because

720
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:22,960
Mark Yoshimoto Namcoff also gave me a link to this song saying this was you know the new black lab part project

721
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,400
Shit man. This shows recorded way too early for me to understand everything

722
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,640
But it does kick ass

723
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,360
On the podcast before the radio

724
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,960
Was she can't confess

725
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,320
The dogs are left to mind

726
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,760
Sometimes

727
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,760
Never find their way

728
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,600
She just

729
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,600
Time to save

730
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,600
There's a way for me today

731
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,200
Things will not be dead for now

732
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:25,200
They will not leave the way

733
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,200
To some other space

734
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,200
Things will not be dead for now

735
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:52,320
She's just the god of the lack of ghost

736
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,360
No worse thing

737
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,360
She could have her hair

738
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,360
Yes, I think I love you

739
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,720
Let's just take in love for clothes

740
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,680
Someday you have to find her home

741
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:17,120
She just time to save

742
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,400
There's a way for me today

743
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,400
Things will not be dead for now

744
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,280
They will not leave the way

745
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,640
To some other space

746
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,520
Things will not be dead for now

747
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:58,800
What's come? It's awfully touch your smile

748
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,680
They make it there

749
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,680
Way into the space

750
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,040
Where the dead out of place

751
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,640
Don't believe me, I've tried

752
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,160
I'm resting for a while

753
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,520
I will look for you again

754
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,800
Someday you have to find the home

755
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,600
Where you go

756
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,600
She just starts to save

757
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,200
There's a way for me today

758
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,040
Things will not be dead for now

759
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,600
They will not leave the way

760
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,840
To some other space

761
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,040
Things will not be dead for now

762
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:15,680
I don't care whether it's Black Lab, New London Fire

763
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,120
And Som is great

764
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,480
Different

765
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,840
Winding up

766
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,080
Thank god it's fried edition of the daily source code

767
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,320
Last show from

768
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,680
The curry condo cannot wait to get back home

769
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,680
I miss my girl so much and

770
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,280
Sometime in the next two weeks when we're back home

771
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,680
We're going to go to Disneyland, the Euro Disney

772
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,720
We had of course to

773
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,720
Postpone our plans because now in the middle of this auction for a home

774
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,520
You know, I don't want to have to leave town when you're in the middle of the auction

775
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,080
Okay, I before I go one more I want to come out. I want to play for you because I thought I was a really good question

776
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,320
I did manage to I actually I don't know if I did all this I hope they are didn't

777
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,520
I have a quick question

778
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,920
Really regarding

779
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,320
e-business

780
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,720
How does how does someone like

781
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:16,720
YouTube with there knows it's quote you from DSC whichever one I'm listening to from many Monday

782
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:28,320
YouTube 100 million video views a day 100 million that's one hell of a lot of anguish that the hell of a lot of information being passed back and forth

783
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,600
So about it you know what candle is a shit hole and it's all very noisy

784
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:39,360
100 million at day and a hell of a night money. I mean seriously. It can't be banner ads

785
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,720
How does that work?

786
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,880
Tell me

787
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,920
You are the parts are that you've got an ugly face anyway

788
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:55,280
Thank you and yes, Camden is a shit hole. Let me just take a take note of that. Let me just write that down

789
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,520
Memo to self do not be as a Camden

790
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,840
Okay, so I thought that was a really good question to take us into the weekend

791
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:09,120
First of all, uh, YouTube runs on the same physical network infrastructure at the podcast delivery network runs on so I

792
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,160
Know what what the theoretical cost would be and I and I know that is a kick ass network

793
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,240
So yeah, and you know obviously if the number of a hundred million videos per day is true

794
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,360
That is a huge amount but I don't think so these guys have investors behind them

795
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:31,120
In fact, uh one of their investors also invested in pod show so not that I know anything more about them than I do now, but

796
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,360
Or than I wouldn't that I would know if I if they weren't investors because

797
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,280
Shit, I have to go beat the information out of him, but it's not so much about

798
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,880
You know how they're gonna make money because there's all kinds of issues

799
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,640
You know, there's all the copyrighted material which of course what YouTube is used for a lot

800
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,360
They're not really providing

801
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,360
They're not providing 100 million

802
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,000
unique visits to their website because these videos are viral so it is all coming off their server

803
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:02,320
So they have some limited ways that they can monetize by putting an ad into the actual video itself

804
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:08,400
Of course is one way and you they like revert as you could click on it and then you could play it on a click through

805
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:14,800
Basis, but that's still no way you're gonna get anywhere near Google numbers for a long time because there's just you know

806
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,440
There's billions of web pages that are being accessed today with Google Adsense or something comparable

807
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,200
And a hundred million just really does not cut it when it comes to that type of advertising on the other hand

808
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,360
If you look at how podcasts are done, they're serialized and and people

809
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:35,040
Have an audience, you know, it's it's not just one video that gets passed around but there's an audience around a show

810
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,640
And that show could consist of videos being passed around in fact be on a lookout for video junky

811
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:49,200
But it's very hard to build up a relationship with you know or or even look at the relationship between the producer of that video

812
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,800
And the audience because it's pretty much you know the the producer is the person who sent it to you

813
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,400
That's almost the way it feels like

814
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:02,720
But that's not what YouTube is that's not why YouTube is so exciting what YouTube is doing is they are proving that

815
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,960
People are willing to

816
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:12,720
Get their video entertainment elsewhere. They are taking their eyes away from traditional television from the box and even though it may be the same stuff

817
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,280
That they're looking at YouTube

818
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,240
It is a different venue and that's what so

819
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,240
I can't last

820
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:28,880
All right everybody. I am on my way home next time you hear from me. I'll be back with the lady Patricia and the pod princess

821
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,200
Pod save the queen which of course will have a new episode out on Monday or on Tuesday since vacation

822
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,880
We should be able to do it the minute I get back home

823
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,760
Thanks so much for pulling me through and I will talk to you on Monday. Bye everybody
