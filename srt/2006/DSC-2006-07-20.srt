16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

I like to think I'm flying into this church.

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Fantastic.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Game brown.

Hey, hey, hey.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I like to think I'm flying into this church.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh, fantastic.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's Adam Curry.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Ladies and gentlemen, the godfather of soul.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Game brown.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Got a brand new thing.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Ain't no thing, you know.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But it's a body girl.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Huh?

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You can't hold it.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Blood guard.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But your body can't hold it.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hey, hey, hey.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I like to think I'm flying into this church.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh, yes, sir.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I like to think I'm flying into this church.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh, yes, sir.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I like to think I'm flying into this church.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh, good, man in pure brains.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You got troubles, please.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
jay.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Keidhan.

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Dude, no.

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
hot beans in it.

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh, you.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It got to be kids, I mean, es,

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
There's a whole way

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Seven, up, you're down

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Ow!

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Say again, hey, hey, hey

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Good time

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You do

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Good time, hey, y'all

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That brand new thing

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's no big dealer

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But it's a bad dealer

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You can't hold it, but it's bad to move it

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Come on

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hey, hey

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I love you

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You're up to this step

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And burn it

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That you're going to steal

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And hear it

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Look

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hey, hey!

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Come on, skid

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It'll be

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll make a challenge

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I got nuggets

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Fuck!

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I got nuggets

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Fuck! I got nuggets

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Fuck! I got nuggets

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I got nuggets

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And I got nuggets

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I got nuggets

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh yeah!

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You don't deserve it.

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You got it.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You got it.

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You got me as pleased.

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You got it.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Somebody please.

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Take that.

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Good.

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No hard feeling.

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Oh man.

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes, they're morning.

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
All of a sudden you showed up on the Podsafe music network.

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
James Brown and gut bucket.

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Even if that song is sucked major as I still would have played it.

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Do you believe the endorsement that this is for the Podsafe music network?

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What the heck is going on?

92
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Are we doing okay here?

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah.

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
For the Podsafe music movement in general.

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
James Brown put this track up on the Podsafe music network.

96
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And that was yesterday morning.

97
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
We're preparing for the Board of Directors meeting.

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And all of a sudden Chris Rockwell starts typing everybody.

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Wow, that is indeed.

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And I was like, dude, are you sure?

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yep.

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We checked it.

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's been verified.

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And this is actually a move by the godfather of sold himself.

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I mean, how can you, how can you argue with that?

106
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's great.

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Link in the show notes, of course, too.

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Got bucket.

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
James Brown on the Podsafe music network.

110
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's crazy.

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Everybody how you doing.

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's early morning.

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Today is of course.

114
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What are we Thursday?

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Is it July 20th already coming to you from Northern California from the Curry condo?

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Just a little bit past 7 a.m.

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
For me, of course, I feel once again like we're so behind the rest of the world.

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Here on the west coast of the United States, everyone is already pretty much had their day.

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And it's going to be beautiful.

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I can see it's going to be another warm day today.

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's going to be clear skies.

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Got some little bit of haze up there in the mountains.

123
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
They seem to be filled with more.

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It looks like oil tankers and maybe is there a container ship out there?

125
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
No, oil tankers are more.

126
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It just seems like there's a lot of ships today.

127
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't know.

128
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm sure it's not related to anything with the weather, but just noticing.

129
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So I'm tired.

130
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The jet lag is already catching up to me.

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Of course, it's been kind of whirlwind if you think about it where I arrived.

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It was at Tuesday, dropped my stuff off at the condo, went straight into the office to prepare

133
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
to help prepare at least our presentation for the board, which is really it's presentations

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
of the wrong word.

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's really we sit there and we evaluate for ourselves.

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What the hell do we just do in the past a couple months?

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And we write it all down and we say, hey, okay.

138
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And here's some stuff we can do better.

139
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And here's some stuff that we learned.

140
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And then we share that with the room full of smart people, which we did yesterday.

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So after all, this may have been excitement about James Brown being on the pod save music network.

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We went off this time.

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It was turned our turn to go over to San Hill Road, which is where many venture capitalists

144
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
sit, but ours in particular.

145
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And it was as I predicted, it was a lot of fun.

146
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
We got some great insights, some great ideas.

147
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I think they were blown away by some of the things that they saw.

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And here's, so I've talked about Ray Lane before.

149
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
He's on our board.

150
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Ray ran Oracle.

151
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He's run big companies and he's very, very involved in not just in pod show,

152
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
but in what's happening in general in media, in pod casting, all forms of media.

153
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And so he comes up to me.

154
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
First thing he says, scruncher.

155
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm like, yes.

156
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hey, what do you think about the godfather of soul?

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's he a folder or scruncher.

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Hi.

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Hmm.

160
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Need to know more.

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So after all that scruncher business, and then Ray said something interesting.

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
He said, you know, there's this thing going on in Los Angeles tonight.

163
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
He might be interested in.

164
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's the official, oh my blackberry is too close to everything.

165
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's the official launch of this new car from the Tesla Motor Corporation.

166
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And it's a car that runs on batteries.

167
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And, you know, it's, you know, me with Trinity and alternative stuff.

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm always interested in cars in general.

169
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You know, but normally when you think about something, there'll be,

170
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
environmentally friendly.

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I don't even know how environmentally friendly these cars are.

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You know, it takes something to charge these batteries.

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And the battery in this, it's like this is actually like a driving battery.

174
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But normally, these cars look like batteries.

175
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You know, they're, look at the Prius.

176
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's a very popular car, but it's not really a sexy car.

177
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So what, what this Tesla Motor Corporation has done is they went to load us.

178
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And that you know that load us alone.

179
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I think it's at least or they're alone.

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't know which one.

181
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But you know, load us.

182
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
They went to load us and had them design the car.

183
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And then they put the engine and the battery and the battery.

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I think weighs 900 pounds.

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's almost half the weight of the car.

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's a two-seater.

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But this thing has an incredible performance.

188
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It goes from zero to sixty and four seconds.

189
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I mean, it's like, and it has, I guess it's two speed automatic or something.

190
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And I'm not quite sure what the top speed is, but basically they were demonstrating the car.

191
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And they had it set up pretty cool at a, at a hanger.

192
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And it was at Long Beach.

193
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's the airport we went to because Ray said, hey, why don't you guys come along?

194
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And we'll fly down.

195
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Now, whatever you get an invitation to fly in a golf stream for, you pretty much are going

196
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
to grab that.

197
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Particularly if there's 30 year old Scotch on board.

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And you know, to fly to L.A. and to look at some incredibly futuristic car that, basically,

199
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
is a laptop with a, a laptop with a 250 mile battery radius that actually drives.

200
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Because that's what it feels like.

201
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's like a driving laptop.

202
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But it was very cool.

203
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And here's the, here's the best part of that whole trip.

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Now you know why I'm so fuzzy because it's like flying.

205
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And, you know, maybe I don't drink.

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So just before landing in L.A. or Long Beach,

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I walk up to the front because I want to sit on the jump seat and watch the landing.

208
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And this is like, how many people can fit on a golf stream?

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And 16 people is a big plane.

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's just, it's me, Ron, Marta, of course, and, and Ray.

211
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And that's it.

212
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And so we're flying.

213
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And we go sit at the front and watch.

214
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And so it was pretty cool.

215
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You know, there was some haze or fog.

216
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And so we kind of dropped down about just about the 1000 foot levels.

217
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Or we saw the runway straight now.

218
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Got under the runway position, glide pad.

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And I was looking a line.

220
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And everything is the same.

221
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You know, it doesn't matter if you're flying a golf stream where you're flying

222
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
the Delta Sierra.

223
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The whole concept is the same.

224
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And the radio works the same.

225
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So I'm enjoying this.

226
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Dude, did they fuck up the landing?

227
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's like, if I hadn't been wearing my seatbelt on the jump seat,

228
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I would have been through the window.

229
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And Ray, of course, wasn't wearing a seatbelt.

230
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And he landed up by Marta's feet somewhere.

231
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And not quite sure what happened.

232
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I think they came in a little bit high.

233
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And well, the speed was probably good.

234
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But I think they came in a bit high.

235
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And just something dropped.

236
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I think they just hold the power.

237
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It seemed like just a, hey, you know,

238
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
it's one of those landings that you just fucked it up.

239
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I've been through that.

241
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But to do it with a $30 million airplane was pretty funny to see.

242
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And the excuses that came out were even funny.

243
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But I could totally appreciate it.

244
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And I felt pretty bad for the guys.

245
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So that was, how about that man?

246
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
How about that for a life?

247
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Crying.

248
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I get around.

249
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So, you know, was back at midnight in bed by 1230.

250
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Up this morning, it's six to, you know, get everything.

251
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And I'm also kind of like auto awakening at six o'clock.

252
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm getting too old for this shit.

253
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Let me see.

254
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What do we have here?

255
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Adam, John, from here of Cook,

256
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Moynihan, I had just listened to,

257
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
set a source code 422.

258
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's laughed my ass off when you're the landing story there.

259
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's like Cherokee 180.

260
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I had a couple of landings like that myself.

261
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I know what it feels like.

262
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't know.

263
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
If anyone other than pilots could get the humor in it like we could.

264
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And it's always amazing how when we do something stupid like that.

265
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The first thing we think about is how many people up in the tower are laughing at us.

266
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I just thought I dropped your line.

267
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Let you know still listening.

268
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm still working out in the garage.

269
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Build my airplane hopefully.

270
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
She'll be in the air.

271
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Just winter.

272
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Things go right.

273
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'll try to do a podcast.

274
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The first podcast from the first flight.

275
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Keep trucking.

276
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Love the show.

277
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Tell when's my man.

278
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yo, buddy.

279
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Tell when's.

280
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yep.

281
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's exactly it.

282
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The only thing we're not worried about safety.

283
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We're not worried about safety.

284
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
We're worried about who's laughing at us when we do that ship.

285
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But it was just really nice to see that.

286
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Not just me.

287
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Low at low hour pilot.

288
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But a very experienced guy is messing up once in a while too.

289
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
If you got anything to call into the show.

290
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Love to hear from you.

291
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And I'm getting but phone numbers now.

292
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But but phone calls.

293
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Which, you know, someone's basically programmed the number into their mobile phone.

294
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Sat down on their phone or whatever.

295
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And then it dials and it's probably Adam Curry daily source code.

296
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So I'm always at the top of the list on people's phone book.

297
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So it's working.

298
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You are putting my numbers in there.

299
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
If you want to pre program it right now.

300
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's plus 201 plus one for the US 201.

301
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
65, 65, 65, 7.

302
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And in the UK plus 4, 4, 2, 0, 7, 6, 8, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3.

303
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I have something here in my show notes.

304
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And I don't want to forget.

305
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The 28th of July is officially CIS admin day.

306
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That's it.

307
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
CIS admin.com.

308
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You know what?

309
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Let me just go take a look at that side for a second.

310
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And I've recognized this in the past.

311
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I think I've even recognized it before.

312
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It was podcasting.

313
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Let's see.

314
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
July 28th, 2006.

315
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The 7th annual system administrator appreciation day.

316
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
There you go.

317
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Don't forget your CIS admin.

318
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And we'll talk about that more as we get closer to the actual day.

319
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I've got an email here from who is this from.

320
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
From Brent from Pod Show Radio.

321
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
He's got some great news.

322
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
He says he's got the first full podcast interview with Rick Nielson of cheap trick.

323
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And they'll be available starting tomorrow Friday.

324
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And I'm just going to kind of paraphrase from Brent's email here.

325
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He says he digs podcasting dude.

326
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Cheap trick has a link to my show on the front page of their website.

327
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
How jealous is Michael Butler going to be when he hears all this?

328
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I mean, Michael, Michael Butler.

329
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The largest cheap trick fan in the world.

330
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I mean, he missed out on this opportunity.

331
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh, my goodness.

332
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
He's going to be so green with it.

333
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I add them.

334
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
This is Derek the band of from Johannesburg in South Africa.

335
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And I hope you are well.

336
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Just wanted to pop into it.

337
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You know that I've started a brand new show on Pod Show.

338
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And thank you so much for the platform to be able to do it.

339
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You'll find a www dot Derek the bandit.

340
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And Derek is spelled DEREK.

341
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Nice and short dot pod show dot com.

342
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It is my anthem of the week where I feature one electronic dance music anthem that is found

343
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
its way into my record box.

344
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And their pod say Adam, I just have to say a big thank you and congratulations to you

345
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
and the whole team at Pod Show.

346
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You guys have done an absolutely incredible job.

347
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm still trying to find my feet around some of the certain parts in Pod Show.

348
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But I'm sure in time I'll get there.

349
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Adam have a fantastic weekend in San Francisco.

350
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And from the bottom of Africa, you take care.

351
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Cheers, cheers.

352
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I love it when he says that when you think about it from the bottom of Africa,

353
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
up to the northern part of California.

354
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But the heck is going on?

355
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
These increments are really doing cool stuff for us.

356
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So of course, Derek is very pleased with Pod Show plus.

357
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I have to say that yesterday, even though I wasn't able to check out the system the whole

358
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
time, I think we're doing two major releases per day with fixes, features, stuff happening.

359
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So you definitely want to check back often because things are coming together and things

360
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
actually are working.

361
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Now of course with all of that positive noise, we got to put some negative in.

362
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Common strip.

363
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Common strip.

364
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Common strip.

365
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Of course not safe for family listening.

366
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I don't carry.

367
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
For facts, fake.

368
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Your podcast is becoming boring.

369
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You are boring me.

370
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You are boring me.

371
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You need more action.

372
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
More controversy.

373
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
More something and not just playing voice feedback from your eskises and horse.

374
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I can't help you in the controversy department because I have found peace and

375
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
throws with judges, smalls.

376
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And we are not at any conflict anymore.

377
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Well, that's a bummer.

378
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Gee, I was so enjoying all those comments on curry.com.

379
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
No, I think the piece is better CSB.

380
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And that, you know, when it comes to that, I'd rather you be a little boring.

381
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
However, I would love to help out in other areas.

382
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
For example, why the fuck you keep promoting only youngs and spirits

383
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:07,000
stick if everybody knows that Americans of British origins in USA are in minority

384
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
and most Americans in USA are of other non-British origins.

385
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Mostly German, Italian and Irish.

386
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
For facts, fake.

387
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You need to leave American British ghetto and be more global.

388
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
For example, Adam, maybe.

389
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Tell us, what side are you taking in current military conflict in Middle East?

390
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Personally, I don't take any side.

391
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I don't want to take any side.

392
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I just want fucking peace everywhere.

393
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
They are worth and in the blogger's field too.

394
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And by the way, bringing that uncle of yours, who is Korea expert as soon as possible,

395
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
it looks like World War III is cooking faster than I thought.

396
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Stay healthy.

397
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Bye.

398
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Oh, he didn't give me his typical yo.

399
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Okay, Commissioner Blogger, I actually started to make a little bit of sense there with this question.

400
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The Middle East conflict, I think the number one thing that we should do

401
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
is which is stop sugar coating this shit.

402
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's not a conflict.

403
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's fucking war.

404
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's real war.

405
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And I don't think I haven't seen a lot of television while I've been over here.

406
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But, you know, you just look at CNN and they got the graphics out and everything.

407
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And I guess, are they now calling it war?

408
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I think we should just call this a war, okay?

409
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It disturbs me greatly.

410
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Are you kidding me?

411
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It really disturbs me.

412
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Everything that's going on there.

413
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
This is a huge issue.

414
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And then to see that conversation that Bush and Blair had.

415
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:49,000
If the answer and everyone's here in the States, it seems like certainly the White House and everyone is concentrating on the fact that the president said shit.

416
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh, boy.

417
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Expertise.

418
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Shit.

419
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But I think what was far more outrageous.

420
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What he said is that, and look,

421
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm just going to take our president's word for it.

422
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
If he says that all that has to happen is that,

423
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
and I couldn't understand it.

424
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I don't know if it was she or they or if that means coffee,

425
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
a non or whoever has to say it,

426
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
but someone apparently has to call Syria and Syria has to call Hezbollah

427
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
and then they have to stop that shit.

428
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
If it's that fucking simple, why don't we find out who's supposed to make the fucking call?

429
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Call fucking Syria already.

430
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Will ya?

431
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And then to have Syria call fucking Asbollah?

432
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And then the shit will be over.

433
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Is that all it takes?

434
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
We have the answer apparently.

435
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Make it happen, please.

436
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Now a word from our spine here.

437
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's the Yanks versus the Brits.

438
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
We'll drive each other crazy,

439
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
but everybody knows that it's apparent to see.

440
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Let just like you and me, it's the Yanks.

441
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And the Brits, the Yanks versus the Brits.

442
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Mind the gap.

443
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Not exactly Yanks versus the Brits,

444
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
although in this case the Yanks will get slammed

445
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
as it pertains to the Tour de France.

446
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I don't need to matter.

447
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm currently at the Tour de France,

448
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm in the Alps.

449
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm trying to leave a message for you.

450
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
This is strange thing that the American seems to be doing here.

451
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And it might be a few of your Yanks versus Brits section.

452
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
They think the bus they got for two hours climb to the top of the

453
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
some of the legendary climbs of the Tour de France,

454
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
such as the Col de Glendon, Galibier, Alps,

455
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and then I hear the top of the climbs.

456
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Herb. Herb.

457
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The shuttle button is the right to take it down.

458
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Now if you're going to do that for two hours,

459
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
ride a commanding.

460
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Surely you want to actually enjoy the experience of

461
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
hammering down the other side at 70 kilometers an hour.

462
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's just very odd.

463
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Everybody looks at them.

464
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's a strange thing.

465
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
They look at the condition coach at the top of the mountain.

466
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That was all really.

467
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The French of A police today because the American

468
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
favourite Floyd Lannis died of death on the final mountain climb

469
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
today.

470
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So I'm sure the lead keeps.

471
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
The French Davis boys and youth people will be loving

472
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
that one tomorrow.

473
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So I'm going to sign off with you.

474
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Good afternoon.

475
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Bye.

476
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Bye.

477
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Okay.

478
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So am I to understand that the US riders in the Tour de France

479
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and please, let's not call it Tour de France.

480
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's Tour de France.

481
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
They do the mountain hill climb thing.

482
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And then when they're done,

483
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
they instead of, you know,

484
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
coasting down on your bike,

485
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
which is I have to say pretty much an American past time.

486
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
They jump into their air condition bus

487
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
to drive them back down the mountain

488
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
to base camp or whatever they stay

489
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
for their, for that particular part of the tour.

490
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah.

491
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I have to admit that is very much the American way.

492
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Absolutely.

493
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Excuse me.

494
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Send sail.

495
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
This sent sail a moment brought to you by

496
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
cold aren't brought to you by

497
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
just admin day July 28, 2006.

498
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Um,

499
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
In fact,

500
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
it would be even better if we had

501
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
a McDonald's up at the top of the mountain.

502
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That would now, that would really make it happen.

503
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm, in fact, I'm amazed.

504
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
They don't have the McDonald's.

505
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
In Iraq, when I went to,

506
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
to Iraq in 2004,

507
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and we were in Camp Smitty,

508
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
but we went down to Bosra,

509
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
which is actually is heating up down there.

510
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
A couple of people have been killed recently.

511
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
English soldiers have been killed in Bosra.

512
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That's where the Dutch,

513
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Marine helicopter base was.

514
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And it's a huge base.

515
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I think there,

516
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
there must have been seven or eight thousand

517
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
troops on this base.

518
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And, and of course,

519
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
the Americans were there.

520
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
The Italians were on that base

521
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and the Brits,

522
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I believe, at the time.

523
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And, of course,

524
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
not only was there,

525
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
um,

526
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
a Burger King,

527
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
but there was also a Pizza Hut.

528
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And that,

529
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
if you want to talk about bizarre,

530
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
stand in the middle of the desert,

531
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
and then go to the Pizza Hut.

532
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That is truly bizarre.

533
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Remember that movie Patricia and I were talking about

534
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
little man?

535
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Well,

536
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
you've heard about it.

537
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It was number two at the box office.

538
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Excuse me.

539
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Did I call it or what?

540
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Without ever having seen the movie,

541
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
without just only seeing the trailer,

542
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I was able to predict it had,

543
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
you know,

544
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
the blackbuster written all over it.

545
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And, um,

546
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
so the movie company is so happy.

547
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
They've actually contracted us to talk about it some more.

548
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And so this is what I promise you I'm going to do.

549
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
This weekend,

550
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
either tomorrow night or over the weekend.

551
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm going to go see little man.

552
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And I'll report on it next week.

553
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
To exactly what I thought about it.

554
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
But, just the feedback I've been getting from people.

555
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's, yeah,

556
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
we love this,

557
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
particularly Americans.

558
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
We love this kind of movie.

559
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I think isn't it coming out in,

560
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I thought it was also out in the UK.

561
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I thought I saw it,

562
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
promo is for it.

563
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Anyway,

564
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
you can check out the little man podcast at littlemanpodcast.com.

565
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
There's interviews on it.

566
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Actually,

567
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I think you'll like the podcast.

568
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It's,

569
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
it's pretty darn good.

570
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I wish they would make a promo for it.

571
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So you can also see the trailer over at littlemanpodcast.com

572
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
and check out the movie.

573
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Because it's the cool thing to do.

574
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
That's what we do.

575
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
We do cool things in America.

576
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Like when it's really hot outside,

577
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
we want to be cool.

578
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So we go into the movie.

579
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's cool.

580
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And then what do we watch?

581
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Yes.

582
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Exactly.

583
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
We watch stuff like Little Man.

584
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Is this a great country or what?

585
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Good morning, Adam.

586
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
John here from Geofus.

587
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And just don't have my work at the A3 this morning.

588
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And just about the lesson to DSC423.

589
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I think it says that it was delivered through to my icon

590
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
to buy a playlist that I can send you via.

591
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
For sure plus.

592
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Hold on one second, John,

593
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
because I got a sick about the serious satellite folks.

594
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You should go to podshow.com.

595
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So you two can download this show easily.

596
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And I'll talk to you tomorrow.

597
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
For the thank God it's Friday edition of the Daily Source God.

598
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
We were having the discussions on the comments on your phone.

599
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
We were having the discussions on the comments on your phone.

600
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
We were having the issues where I was adding stuff and nothing was getting saved.

601
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And then I'd be getting in and my iTunes will be thinking,

602
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
but they wouldn't be any.

603
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I have shows in the speaker that play a playlist.

604
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But now I'm having to say it's been available for two days.

605
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I'll take this.

606
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And stuff didn't ask those.

607
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Cheat us to the guy who you're in to getting that little fixed.

608
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And they're finding the digital mining non-podshow plus fees

609
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
into my iPod NASA.

610
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I've no fully running of a podshow plus.

611
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
That's great.

612
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And hey man, you're missing a hot one over here.

613
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I mean, yesterday it hit 37 degrees.

614
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So a little bit warmer for a minute.

615
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So here are the good work.

616
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So again.

617
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Bye bye.

618
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Cheers, John.

619
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
From Gilford.

620
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Check it in from back home.

621
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
37 degrees.

622
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
That's like 96 degrees Fahrenheit.

623
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Something's outrageous.

624
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's in the mid 90s.

625
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And as you know, we have no air conditioning.

626
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
That's actually that's pretty bad for Patricia's health condition.

627
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So she's been staying indoors as cool as possible.

628
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You know, fans everywhere because of the lack of air conditioning.

629
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
But John, cool.

630
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'm glad that it worked out.

631
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I told you that we get that fixed.

632
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And believe me was top of the list because I've been.

633
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Listening to podcast and watching video podcasts exclusively through through podshow

634
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Plus all throughout the day to period.

635
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And I got, I got used to it.

636
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You know, I no longer am using iTunes only.

637
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I have one playlist that I sync up my news playlist.

638
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And if you go to atom.podshow.com, you can see my channels right there.

639
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And you'll see what shows are in there.

640
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And that's the one that syncs up to my iPod.

641
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And if I want to change anything, I want to add it from my travel.

642
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Then I just do it right from my podshow plus account.

643
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Also, so I told you that, you know, we're releasing twice a day.

644
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
We're putting new updates up there, new updates, fixes, features,

645
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
etc.

646
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And so the channels are now, there's a couple other things we still have to

647
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Fix on the channels, like the name of the channel.

648
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And I think the show notes are being truncated.

649
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
There's all kinds of stuff that we're still looking at.

650
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's just, it's amazing how much we didn't catch in beta,

651
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
even with hundreds, hundreds of beta testers of which several

652
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
hundred were developers.

653
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And there's still a whole bunch of stuff that we just didn't catch.

654
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So we're fixing all that.

655
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
But you can also now, if you go to your to my,

656
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
go to your collection and under your channels,

657
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
you can import an external RSS feed.

658
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So if there's something that you can't find through search,

659
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
you could, of course, just copy the link and place it in there.

660
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Also, we import OPML.

661
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
So if you want your subscriptions to carry over and you want all your podcasts

662
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
to be manageable through our interface, you can import them with, again,

663
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
under the advanced button there on the channel.

664
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
You can import, it's right there up at the top under your shows.

665
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
You can import an OPML file.

666
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So what you could technically do if you're using iTunes.

667
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And we should, which has the screencast do to actually do a screencast

668
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
of this because it is cool.

669
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
You can take everything you have in iTunes.

670
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You can export all your subscriptions as they call it.

671
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Into Gets on Pod Show Plus.

672
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You can export that as an OPML file and then you go into my collection

673
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
and you can import that OPML file.

674
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And then you can start to split it up and make all kinds of different channels.

675
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So we're getting some shit done that isn't gentlemen

676
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
and liking it very much.

677
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And keep the comments coming for Shadow Falls, man.

678
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
People are loving this.

679
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Shadow Falls.podshow.com.

680
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I think part of the appeal has got to be the music.

681
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Munk has really outclassed himself this time into a whole new level.

682
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And so I'm kick so much ass.

683
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It's Molly Steen.

684
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I am from DMN.

685
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I just became.

686
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I was dead for her.

687
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
For us to be.

688
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Bets wins both ways.

689
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Never asked my name.

690
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I am here.

691
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I am here.

692
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I am here while you're sleeping.

693
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I am late.

694
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I am late.

695
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I am late for a crazy.

696
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I am here.

697
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I am here.

698
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I am here for godийs my way to my home.

699
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I am here for godийs my way to my home.

700
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I am here for godийs my way to my home.

701
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I am here for godийs my way to my home.

702
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I am here for godийs my way to my home.

703
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I am here, I am there where you're sleeping

704
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I am alive, I am alive, I am there for a free sleep

705
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I am, I am

706
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I am here

707
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I am alive

708
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I am alive

709
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:03,640
To forget all of his life.

710
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:11,400
On how else do you love me?

711
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,080
That's our autograph.

712
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,440
Ok, let's go take a look at that!

713
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,440
Amazing.

714
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:50,440
I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here

715
00:31:50,440 --> 00:32:20,440
I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, and I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here,

716
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,440
that again. Link in the show notes, of course, taking to the Pods have music networks

717
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:31,480
who mugs page. I am Molly's theme. It's from Shadow Falls, check it out at Shadow Falls.podshow.com.

718
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:38,280
This is something completely new. I'm the kid that used to lay in bed when I was five or six

719
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:43,560
years old. Had a little blue record player where you opened up the lid and then in the lid was

720
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:49,880
the speaker and I think I had a couple albums. One or two that I stole for like, I don't know,

721
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,480
for some reason I took like Jesus Christ to restore something that my parents had downstairs.

722
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:02,280
See? I've got to think of Mom for a second. But I also had a vinyl of Peter in the Wolf and it

723
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:08,280
was with classical instruments and you'd hear this like, well, well, of course, we all know Peter in the

724
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:16,920
Wolf. And then here comes the wolf and you hear the cello you go. So this whole theater of the

725
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:21,720
mind thing appeared. You know, and I could really visualize the story as the narrator told me

726
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,120
what was happening and the instruments were playing. So now when you listen to Shadow Falls,

727
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,200
immediately it's like, it's like reading a book but without reading.

728
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:37,080
Immediately you've got this. You can see it. You can see I have a picture of what the actors

729
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:44,280
look like at the scenes. I can see it all. It's really, really nice to have this experience.

730
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,600
Now you really, and I recommend you be completely alone and not the stir because you don't want

731
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,840
to have to stop. And then it's only like 25 minutes, but you don't want to have to stop made way.

732
00:33:52,840 --> 00:34:00,600
So find a quiet place to listen to this to this show. I guarantee it's an experience you probably

733
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:07,720
haven't had ever. And if not that, then in a long, long time. Okay, Doki. So I'll tell you what,

734
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,400
I'm going to head off to a pod show HQ. Today we start moving forward. Oh, you know about Shadow

735
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:19,400
Falls. I wanted to say, I actually have the entire backstory. And I have, and there's like outtakes

736
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:25,160
and stuff. And I'm thinking maybe I should let you hear some of that. Or maybe I can post some of

737
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:30,280
the backstory somewhere because you'll love it when it comes to the, you know, who's going to win

738
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:36,760
the wolf? It'll be the coyote. Or it'll be some other farm, man. Hopefully the show notes should be

739
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:42,040
a little bit organized today. I cast Blaster My Cook knee up and told me that I needed to start

740
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:47,240
a bulleted list in the show notes because now just by clicking and playing a sound that automatically

741
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:52,200
makes an entry with a time code into the show notes. And if you actually fill out your ID3

742
00:34:52,200 --> 00:35:00,840
information, it will put that in there, which a lot of people still are doing. All right, send me

743
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,840
your music for tomorrow. Well, yeah, it's going to be the thank god as Friday edition of the Charlie

744
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:09,000
when we're Northern California. We got to rock it out. So send it into me. And that's yes, I'm looking

745
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,680
at you, Jersey Todd, the official music colleges of the Charlie. Get it in early, get it in the

746
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:17,000
as soon as you can. I'll be back here tomorrow on the source code. Thanks for listening. Bye. Bye.

747
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:27,160
You still got to hit the right button no matter what. Another pod show podcast. Stick it in your ear.

748
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,800
Get this podcast and more great ones like it on the high performance pod cast delivery network

749
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:43,320
from pod show and limelight networks. I love it.
