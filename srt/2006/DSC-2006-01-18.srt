Delta Shara Charley 3-1-8

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
He very careful with this podcast, experimental technology is in use

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And change your life again

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But we're doing it more

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And I think it is because

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We're all times like your turn

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's for you

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's for you

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's for you

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's for you

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's for you

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's for you

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't know what I'm doing

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I don't make it hard

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But I don't want to know

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's for you

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's for you

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's for you

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Let it go go go go go

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let's see what this should matter

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's for you

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let's see

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's for you

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's for you

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I don't want to go no more

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But if you're getting better

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
All right

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You're close my heart

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Oh

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Everything I want is for you

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's for you

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's for you

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's for you

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's for you

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's for you

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's for you

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't make it hard

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But I don't want to know

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's for you

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's for you

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's for you

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's for you

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's for you

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't want to go

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Everything I want is for you

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's for you

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't want to go

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's for you

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't know

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's for you

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's for you

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Because of the reason you stay and get married

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And everything I wanted is for me

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And some of the mistakes and everything

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't what I'm doing, I'm making less

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But I don't want no face to live

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Because of the reason you stay and get married

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And some of the mistakes and everything

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't what I'm doing, I'm making less

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But I don't want no face to live

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Pot's safe, my little radio waste another night

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
From the pot's safe music network, hey everybody

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
How you doing halfway through the week

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's Wednesday

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And nothing better than a hump day to start

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Experimenting with some of that pod show technology

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Let me explain what I'm doing

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You know that we've got all the new stuff rolling out

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We're going into beta and lots of products and services

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And lots of cool stuff that's going on

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's right, radio stations in your laptop

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Broadcasting by the pot casting

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Let me start off with a couple of audio comments

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And then I'll get straight into what I'm doing today

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
First one from Peter Snakers

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let me see, I hope I'm not bothering you with this

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But I noticed on your podcast the sound of your voice sounds watery

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Like something's wrong with your vocal cords

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The distortion in the sound in the mids through the high range

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll say not too high

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's really noticeable when you say something with a long eye sound

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Or when you

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Other sounds, Brahms and music seem to sound fine

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I've heard the compression might cause this

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
In this case, probably only in the frequency range of your voice

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Well, I hope it's me or my setup

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Still enjoying your show and the Brahms

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Keep it up, Pete Snakes

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Well, wait, let me read the second one

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Hold on a second

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll tell you this is from Chris May

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'll just move this window over just a tad

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's actually

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hold on bear with me now

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You'll find out what I'm doing here in a moment

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I must be one of the rare listeners that is not had any problems with your feed through iTunes

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And I've been listening since late spring

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
However, I've noticed that every now and then you play music on the DS

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The audio will skip forward through that throughout the song

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The most recent example was today's episode 317 with my life

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
During the 34th minute of Delta Sierra Charlie

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The audio skips no less than seven times

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Think about it further

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Just happen while you were talking a couple of weeks ago

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Something else to look into, I guess

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Hopefully someone else has reported it

107
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll try to send you another note if I notice it again

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You're pushing me closer and closer to starting my own podcast every day

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Especially with the car testing podcast idea

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Man, that would be fun

111
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Totally

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Especially since there's an absence of information for what cars

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Tall people would enjoy

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Well, that's interesting

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's very true actually

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Tall people like myself

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Vertically challenged as I like to say

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It do have problems with automobiles

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If I have to take new and use cars out for spin on some of the back roads around Virginia

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And I think I can make that sacrifice

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah sure, gotcha

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Okay, so I got so fed up with all these audio problems

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Which were I'd have to say

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm not all necessarily the fault of the Mac

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But the shortcomings of the Mac that I was using

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And let me just preface by saying

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I've been a Mac user all my life

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I love Mac and Tosh

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I love Apple

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I actually I love my new power book

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But I was really really hating these sound problems

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Now the first problem

133
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Regarding the audio

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So there's really this three problems

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
First of all the the warbling of my voice

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That could very well be compression

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I've done some testing with this new setup

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Which I'll talk about in a second

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And it may be better

140
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We'll just have to work on that

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But that is probably a combination of

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What MP3 can do with sound

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Because it remember it's not a lossless format

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's compressed so you are losing stuff

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And it's probably chopping shit out of my extremely low vocal cords

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Skipping of recording

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Well we've had a lot of that

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's the audio hijack pro

149
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And when you're reading and writing to discs

150
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And doing all kinds of stuff

151
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's sometimes it actually reported

152
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It'll say skipping

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But that is definitely a problem that has occurred

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And of course the infamous now infamous audio skipping

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That Apple does acknowledge

156
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But they're fixed so far as being to run

157
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Only one audio application at a time

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Which is just a non-starter when it comes to podcast

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Because you have to have at least two open on your machine

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
One to record

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And one to play back audio

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So I was

163
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
A combination of things

164
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
First of all I wanted to really do a full end to end test

165
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Of our podcast delivery network

166
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Anyway I did

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I went out this morning

168
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Right after I got up and did my things

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And I drove down to Best Buy

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And bought me a new PC

171
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's right

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I got a Windows machine here

173
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Slap top

174
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This is a Toshiba Portage A

175
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And it's ultra ultra thin ultra ultra light

176
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
All I was looking for really was something that was reasonably small thin light

177
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Then I could just pack away

178
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That I wouldn't care about too much

179
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You know I'm not going to use this as my main computer

180
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But I am going to use it

181
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
For cast blaster

182
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Because I'm back on the cast blaster

183
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Got to tell you

184
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And I'll actually have to be honest

185
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I have not looked at cast blaster for quite a while

186
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Because you know the craplet

187
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Really was the wrong purchase

188
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I bought it at the time for cast blaster

189
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's a

190
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
A vera tech I think is what it is

191
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Piece of shit basically

192
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's simple

193
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The shitty sound card

194
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So I was looking something with a good sound capability

195
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
With a PC slot

196
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Because I knew that I would want to have an additional sound card

197
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So I got a creative lab sound blaster PC card

198
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Which just looked right into the slot

199
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And I've been playing with this thing

200
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
A little bit today

201
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But really for the past hour configuring everything

202
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And wow it's really cool

203
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Because you can set it up now

204
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Cast blaster mic is on a whole bunch of different things

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You can set it up

206
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We're using an external mixer

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
As I'm doing

208
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It has an emboard limiter

209
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
There's no latency when you listen to it

210
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And it's almost impossible to overmodulate

211
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Now it is possible for me to overmodulate my mixer

212
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So we have to I'm kind of keep my eye on all different

213
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
View meters and making sure that everything's kind of staying in the safe zone

214
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But it still could happen

215
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But the limiter basically stops you from being able to distort the sound on the recording

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Now the cool thing about cast blaster is that it ties into the podcast delivery network

217
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So now you enter your show notes in cast blaster

218
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You record in cast blaster

219
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You describe your show

220
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And it actually if you're logged into the podcast delivery network

221
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You can have multiple shows on the pdn

222
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And it'll let you select which show and it'll change all the values automatically

223
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And you just hit one button click and you're done

224
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It sends off show notes to your show site

225
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It sends off the MP3 file

226
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Kind of does despite everything automatically

227
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It truly is one

228
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Well there's no step three

229
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Let's put it that way

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
One record two

231
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Publish there is no step three

232
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah go check your shit

233
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
See if it worked

234
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That's really it

235
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And so far I've been playing with a little bit and I really digging it

236
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I think now cast blaster mic is on vacation

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
He's packed away and some shed in the UK where he always goes

238
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And he's completely income unaccado and unreachable

239
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Which is cool

240
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Everyone's entitled to a vacation

241
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But it's too bad he couldn't witness this

242
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I know he'd be jazzed

243
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So the only thing left for cast blaster

244
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
As far as I'm concerned

245
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'd love to have a MIDI control surface

246
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That would be so cool

247
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Because you can control all the faders and everything

248
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Through keyboard commands

249
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But it would be very cool if we had

250
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
If you could just have

251
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Maybe three faders

252
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That you could control

253
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What's going on on the software through MIDI

254
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And we've talked about that before

255
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Maybe he's ready for it by now

256
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But I'm pretty jazzed with what I'm seeing

257
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
When I bought a new license myself

258
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Am I owned a

259
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Of course, I couldn't reach him

260
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I couldn't get a free license key

261
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But it well worth it

262
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Oh man, fantastic

263
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So the way I've got it routed now

264
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Oh actually I figured something else out

265
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
This is where my tea here

266
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I figured out how to record Skype as well

267
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And you can do it with two sound cards

268
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So there's of course as a built-in sound card this thing has

269
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But then with the additional sound card

270
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And the mixer

271
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I found out how to record Skype calls

272
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And I can actually send a mix of

273
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What's being played back down the line

274
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
To the person on the other end

275
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Listening to Skype

276
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So they wouldn't actually hear me through the microphone

277
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
In the PC or an external mic

278
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
They actually hear the output of the mixer

279
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So

280
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Kudos to mic

281
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And everyone had cast glass at our calm on the forum

282
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And the forum moderators

283
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And everyone providing feedback

284
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I guess what are we up to now

285
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Beta 51

286
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Getting very close to what I would say

287
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Is something that's spot on

288
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Just a quick

289
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Administrative note

290
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
For those of you who thought I would show up in Atlanta

291
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yesterday or today, sorry

292
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yesterday the day before actually

293
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It didn't happen

294
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm really sorry

295
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I was able to email a couple people back

296
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Who would really wanted to hook up

297
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
If we had gone, it would have been a very short turn around anyway

298
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But the meeting has been postponed

299
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So

300
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Which was actually good

301
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Because it was Martin Luther King's birthday

302
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It was the wrong day to have any type of meeting

303
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Now of course, I was also

304
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Wigning about wanting to

305
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Meeting to go to Australia yesterday

306
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
This is a bit

307
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
How many thousands of you just thoughts in sale?

308
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Let's see

309
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
In Delta Shara, Charlie 317

310
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You talk about going to Australia

311
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
This immediately reminded me of a guy who's built his own

312
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
747-400 cockpit

313
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Powered by that simulator I told you about

314
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
PS1

315
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Every year, this is from

316
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Mr. Meers

317
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Every year in November a couple of guys and girls apparently

318
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Meet there to do world flight Australia

319
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Assimulated flight around the world to raise money for the flying doctors

320
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Maybe you could get

321
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Matt to put you on the pilot roster for a flight pilot roster

322
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
To fly a leg or two

323
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Okay, I'm going to get in the 747-400

324
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Sim and fly this thing

325
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Also, there's sound seeing flights over Antarctica

326
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
From a few cities in Australia

327
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Around New Years

328
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Very cool

329
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
He says, I don't think that alone would be worth a long flight

330
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But unfortunately

331
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What was he saying?

332
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh, he would love to go to the Antarctic flights

333
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Antarctic flights, but doesn't have the dough

334
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Okay

335
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Um, that's not really a business reason

336
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But it's certainly an interesting one

337
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That's for sure

338
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I got another

339
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Australia comment here from Jack Sauer

340
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Uh, excuse to come to Australia

341
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And excuse to come to Australia

342
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Sorry, and a business reason to come here

343
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Would be to come over to Adelaide to check out the podcast

344
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Magazine

345
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Uh, try promoting podcasting in Melbourne, Sydney, and Perth

346
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
If it's worth it, let me know

347
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
We should catch up for a Sensei

348
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Uh, Jack, are you the guy that's putting together the podcast magazine?

349
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Uh, definitely let me know what's going on with that

350
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
That could be, that could be almost construed as a business reason

351
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
If you can get one or two more business reasons

352
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Then I might be able to make that trip

353
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It would be nice, you know, Sydney, Melbourne, Perth

354
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And then I guess I'm already halfway home, right?

355
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Check this out

356
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Well, I guess our good buddy Roger heard the call

357
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Uh, heard the jingle, the Jeff Smith put together for him

358
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And he sent in this little ditty for us

359
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I was just wondering what you smell like

360
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You're thinking

361
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Uh, let me smell

362
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Hold on, Roger, let me smell myself for you, baby

363
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I actually smell pretty fresh after

364
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
After only a few hours of this day

365
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Um, but to be quite honest, Roger, I think you would much more prefer

366
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
To come over to San Francisco and walk the hallways of the condo

367
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Because you know, it's only me in the curry condo

368
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And then in this building, there must be 300 Asian women

369
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And they all walk up and down the hallways with damp hair

370
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Because of course, we have a spot on a pool and everything

371
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And they walk around a t-shirt with damp hair

372
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Because I'm so much taller than they are in the elevator

373
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And I just kind of hover above them and

374
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I gotta tell you, it smells really, really, really good

375
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah

376
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Hello, Adam and friends, this is Michael Odee from the most people are DJ's podcast

377
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And soon I'm going to be part of the Pod Show Network

378
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I podcast is a show where everybody's a critic and most people are DJ's

379
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That's a lyric by the great band, the whole study

380
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And that's also a description of being a music and media fanatic

381
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
After doing zines in the 90s and making countless CD compositions

382
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
With podcasting, I finally found a way to let people know about great indie music

383
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And fringe pop culture stuff

384
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And I've been doing it for nearly 30 shows

385
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm excited about joining Pod Show and maybe even quitting my day job

386
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So look for most people or DJ's on the podcast Network soon

387
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
By the way, the music in the background

388
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
In what track are you called, looks on tape

389
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Right on

390
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Most people are DJ's joining Pod Show, congratulations

391
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Great to have you on the network

392
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And you too will soon enjoy the luscious sounds of cast blaster

393
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Connecting everything

394
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Oh man, good times for sure

395
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I guess every single day this week we're going to be able to announce a new podcast

396
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Joining the Network with this is very cool, we've been doing a lot of stuff here

397
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Hello, that's a spike on the mic

398
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And you're listening to Adam Curry's daily source code

399
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Okay, one drawback is if you don't listen and remember exactly what everything is

400
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Then you just might miss the cues

401
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
There's got these little jingle I actually should have put that in a different player

402
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
In cast blaster, you can basically put anything anywhere you want

403
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But the longer players have a countdown timer and the short ones

404
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Which are really meant for jingles and effects and stuff

405
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Have no countdown timer, I kind of wish they did though

406
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Although I understand I do kind of also understand what Mike is saying

407
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That that does mess up the interface somewhat

408
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Okay, got to think about that, got to work on it

409
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Well, you know what, let's just do it again and pretend it never happened, okay?

410
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Hello, this is Spike on the mic, and you're listening to Adam Curry's daily source code

411
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Hey Adam, this is, let's just say Louis

412
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm the producer of the quasi-to-week connection podcast

413
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Hey, thanks for playing our promo the other day

414
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Anyway, I want to offer a little tech tip to your audience

415
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Particularly those folks who use iTunes to aggregate and listen to their podcasts

416
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Let me first say that iTunes is on sure you'll agree broad podcasting the masses and for that

417
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I plot Apple

418
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I will say however that once you search subscribing to more than a handful of podcasts

419
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Listening to them with any efficiency and iTunes becomes a chore

420
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I thought I'd offer a tip for setting up what I like to call a podcast radio station in iTunes

421
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What you want to do is create a smart playlist in iTunes

422
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Name it whatever makes sense

423
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I call mine podcast playlist

424
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
On the first line of the smart playlist dialogue

425
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Select podcast and then select is true

426
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Over to the right click the plus sign to add another rule

427
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
On the second rule select play count

428
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And is and then enter the number zero into the final field

429
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Lastly at the bottom of the smart playlist dialogue

430
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Make sure that the live updating box is checked

431
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That's it

432
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Once you've done that

433
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You'll have a smart playlist you can listen to every day

434
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And it will only contain those episodes that you've not yet heard

435
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Once they're played they drop out of the playlist like magic

436
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Now you can of course add more rules to this playlist for the refinement gets added

437
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Or take specific podcasts out of the daily rotation

438
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Anyway, thanks for your time

439
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And be sure to check out the closet totally connection at

440
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
www.closetoolie.com

441
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Or look up closet holy and iTunes

442
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Later

443
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Thank you very much

444
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Yeah, that's actually how I do it

445
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
A smart list that I created which I call the podcast list

446
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And and I like it because it gives you reverse chronological order if you sort it by date

447
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Which by the way you have to select under views

448
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You have to add that as a

449
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
As a column in your in your iTunes view

450
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's too bad that isn't on by default

451
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And they don't even have a

452
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I agree I've subscribed to a whole bunch of podcasts and so much easier just to go

453
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Start at the top, you know, so what's going on now

454
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I don't have the play count set in

455
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Because I believe well first of all I stop and I start stuff all the time

456
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Well actually

457
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I wonder

458
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
If you stop it midway

459
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Will it then still give you a play count?

460
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Probably when you probably have to listen to the whole thing before it gives you a play count

461
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'll have to look into that

462
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
If you're in the Bay Area

463
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And

464
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Looking for some fun work

465
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Today

466
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Had a meeting with

467
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Just Sue

468
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And we've got a job opening

469
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And we can take you right now

470
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
If you're a flash

471
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Programmer

472
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
We have people who can program flash and design and flash

473
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But I guess that this is like a hot

474
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Hot area or something like that

475
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
There's just a lot of requests

476
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It must be the whole web 2.0 thing

477
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Everyone's hiring flash and java script

478
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Developers so anyway

479
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Looking for a flash programmer

480
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Action script

481
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
To expert

482
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Proven experience using

483
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Using action script to core classes

484
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Ability to create new classes

485
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Wow

486
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Experience using

487
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Action script to components and events

488
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And create clips that interact with dynamic content

489
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Examples are PHP XML

490
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And oh also if you have any experience with creating

491
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Streaming media players

492
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Then you're in luck

493
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But you got to hurry up because we'll be closing this

494
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Opening very very soon

495
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Just fire off an email to Sue at podshow.com

496
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I promised I was going to broadcast her email address

497
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Because

498
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
She hasn't filled this job like she said she would

499
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Damn it

500
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Sue with podshow.com

501
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Let me see

502
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Actually so we have a pretty big day ahead

503
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Got a board of directors meeting

504
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And oh man

505
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So it sucks so bad

506
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
We had everything all set up

507
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Because the office is almost done

508
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You know the doors are in and you know

509
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Miner stuff like that

510
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And we had the conference room which has doors

511
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But no panels in the doors yet

512
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You know nice lighting

513
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And we got the coffee machine and everything's kind of ready

514
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And we were going to have the board directors meeting

515
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
At HQ this month

516
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
But word came down from the mountain

517
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
That Muhammad just ain't going to move

518
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yeah, it's like coordinating

519
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
What is it six people seven people

520
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I don't know it's usually pretty big meetings

521
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Just wasn't possible

522
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
So unfortunately we'll have to drive to Sand Hill Road

523
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's kind of funny because I'm threatening to take Trinity

524
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
In fact I want to take Trinity

525
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And I but

526
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
No one seems to want to let Ron and myself

527
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Both drive in Trinity

528
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
To any meeting because you know

529
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
They're afraid that we won't drive

530
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Which is so unfair although I did get a warning light

531
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
As I was pulling into my parking space in the garage

532
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Here at the condo

533
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I got a warning light and I looked it up in the

534
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It looked like a break light but it was amber

535
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It wasn't red

536
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And it looked like I guess the front break pads are wearing thin

537
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So break pads will be needed

538
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Very soon

539
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Maybe the bio bio basis fuel guys

540
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And bio fuel oasis guys

541
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And Berkeley can hook me up with that

542
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Can you imagine

543
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I just want me to just go to a number of satis garage

544
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Just pull in

545
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Sound seeing two of the whole thing

546
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And say hey man here I am this is my rock and ride

547
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It's just a thought

548
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Hey you got something new for

549
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
The satellite folks a new sound

550
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Which means we're leaving y'all

551
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And we'll be back tomorrow

552
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Pacific Coast Hellway is next for you

553
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Listen to us on serious stars 103

554
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah

555
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Oh man

556
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
The sound was kind of indirect

557
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Because

558
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
As a mistake on my part

559
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It's routed to the other sound

560
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
The other sound card and it went out to my

561
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Logitech MM50 speakers

562
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
But you got the idea right

563
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
So now it's just us all of us on the podcast

564
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Do you believe anything is possible

565
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000

Alrighty

582
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
A couple more emails here

583
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I had to go back into Gmail

584
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And delete a whole bunch of stuff

585
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Unfortunately because I hit my max

586
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And I just didn't have the balls to

587
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Going big for more

588
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
So I'm already I'm already using four gigs

589
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And what is kind of cool though is in the search function

590
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You can just say

591
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
You know show me everything from

592
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Let me see

593
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
What I have a search function

594
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Has attachment

595
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Subject promo

596
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Contains the words

597
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
MP3

598
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And also I selected for

599
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You know a year ago

600
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
So I was able to

601
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You know basically get rid of a whole bunch of junk

602
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
That won't have junk

603
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
But stuff that I'm pretty sure I won't ever use again

604
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
But

605
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Then again

606
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It's a shame

607
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It's a shame

608
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I love Gmail so much

609
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I wish I could buy unlimited space

610
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
That would really make it cool

611
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Chris Ali Villardo

612
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Right to me

613
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Says been meaning to write this for a while

614
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Back on New Year's

615
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I got drunk off my ass

616
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And when I was puking

617
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
From 1215am until 5am New Year's day

618
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
All I could think of

619
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Was the theme song

620
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
To Trinity

621
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Trinity

622
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
The quintessential luxury

623
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Oh

624
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Trinity

625
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Trinity

626
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
From the biodes of industry

627
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Yo

628
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So it's not really like I have a long Trinity segment

629
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
In fact we already discussed a little bit about Trinity

630
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
But I just wanted to see how it worked

631
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Transitioning from the

632
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
The Jeff Smith composed Trinity track extended theme song

633
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Into the tag and see how that worked on cast blasters

634
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Or see if it did a good experience

635
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
But do you have one email

636
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Oh shoot it's something that we can't use here

637
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah

638
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Can't underwards at me a picture of

639
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Biodes of t-shirt

640
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I was pretty dumb I guess

641
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Should have prep that a little bit better

642
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Okay let's see if it works

643
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
So basically I would finish up my Trinity segment

644
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And then I do something like this

645
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Oh wait a minute

646
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Sorry a little bit of pilot error

647
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Here we go let's try one more time

648
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
By the way when you download cast blaster

649
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Comes pre-installed and pre-populated with a couple of pot safe music tunes

650
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Like my little radio waste another night

651
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Which I've played at the beginning of the show

652
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And chance

653
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
We go now to spin around to the leaders of the follow

654
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Wave the light and for some kind of say

655
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So spin around to the leaders of the follow now

656
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
The death president's game

657
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
See the cups is everywhere

658
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
In the street has the unfair

659
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Look around you already now

660
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
The Nixon land takes his own land

661
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
So fill out the question

662
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Then jump into a hip-hop

663
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Oh yeah

664
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:53,000
We go now to the leaders of the follow

665
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Wave the light and for some kind of say

So spin around to the leaders of the follow

00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Wave the light and for some kind of say

674
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
So spin around to the leaders of the follow

00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000

00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So spin around to the leaders of the follow

683
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Wave the light and for some kind of say

684
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So spin around to the leaders of the follow

685
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Wave the light and for some kind of say

686
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:53,280
I'll be demoing for our board, I'll be demoing a purchase of song on the podcast music network.

687
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:58,440
Unfortunately, the next step I'm about to make in my process here today, you won't be able to

688
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,440
witness.

689
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,320
Well, the fact that you're listening to this means that it worked.

690
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,880
I'm going to stop recording in a couple of seconds when I'm done, and then I'm going

691
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,880
to hit publish.

692
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,720
No, actually, I'm going to just tighten up the show notes first.

693
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,160
Hit publish, and then it should all work.

694
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,720
And if it does all work, then you won't notice a thing.

695
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,120
Now, what I might have screwed up, although I don't think so, is in the description,

696
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,120
the ID3 tags.

697
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,640
I think I did it pretty consistent with what I've always been doing up till now.

698
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,480
So hopefully, all of that works.

699
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,240
If not, I'm sure you will let me know through adamantcurry.com.

00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
Take care y'all.

710
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,640
Only cast blaster mic would make lighters.

711
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,920
Another pod show pod cast.

712
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,400
Stick it in your ear.
