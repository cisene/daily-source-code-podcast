1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 339

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Delta Sierra Charlie

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Almost live from Northern California

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Dear Adam, I'm an old lady in Pennsylvania

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That listens to your show every day

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm not a podcaster but I love the technology

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm a kidney cancer survivor and I wanted to say that I love this song good day

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You played on Wednesday's show, it touched me

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I play it over and over

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Take care of the good work

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
57 years young in Pennsylvania

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm a friend of the fact that we are here

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Must that make today a good day

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
A good day

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Wake up as time derives in shine

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Just another day in this life of mine

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And take a deep breath

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
My lungs still took a pass

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He's got to be a good day

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Because that has to be stretched out my arms

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I fail out my memory

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
To be true-binated

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No end of the possibilities

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He's a mine

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It fills my blood

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Never so becomes old

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
As I swing from the bottom line

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Some with time

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I finally feel fine

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Days as it should be

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Of my own design

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There's no alarm clock

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Need to when I'll rest

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Need to dream mine

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Decating with them's arm

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
All that I need tonight

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And choose a bad day

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And I'm on choose to be

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Because you can't have a good day

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Unless you believe

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Every day couldn't battle

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Both be around

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So let's focus all this

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Into the pocket

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's down to a bread

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't want to talk about the bad day

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But my friend

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
All the fact that we are here

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Then be next to Jay

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't care

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Now come I should, I don't care

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,040
Go there

56
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't let them talk about the bad day

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And my friend

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All the fact that we are here

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Then be next to Jay

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't care

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hey!

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Hey, hey!

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,560
You'd make the sun find the horizon

64
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,000
The home shadows stretch out

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,440
A risk-air flies in

66
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,680
Figuring in the room

67
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,160
Cooling the conversation

68
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,280
Cones sets in

69
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,960
The moment of meditation

70
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,320
The whole base playing

71
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,280
Back in my mind

72
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,800
The whole of people in the faces

73
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,080
In this moment of time

74
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,720
The summer

75
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,160
Wearing smiles on this bottle

76
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,120
In the misery

77
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,320
Some find tomorrow

78
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,760
While others become history

79
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,880
Now we're the wild end

80
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,920
And my people off the wall

81
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,880
The artists love

82
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,760
One of the stars

83
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,600
One of the solar lights are darkness

84
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,640
Could be the dumbest

85
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,000
And a good convenience part

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,200
Has learned about respect

87
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,040
Between the close and the pharmacy

88
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,800
I've been the farmer in the season

89
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,760
Not the harvesters

90
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,960
Learned as old as seeds

91
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,320
And I leave where the harvest

92
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,200
Now everything

93
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,160
Goody, valuable

94
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,800
Be around

95
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,920
So that's what we saw

96
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,880
Listen to the five

97
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,320
And it's not all the other day

98
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
Yeah

99
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,360
No more

100
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,080
Talk about the past

101
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,200
Hey, hey, hey, hey

102
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,640
For my friend

103
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
I want all the fact

104
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,360
That we are here

105
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,720
We're here

106
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,080
That makes the day

107
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,920
Oh

108
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,560
Oh, today

109
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,760
No more

110
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,680
Oh, now

111
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,880
Oh, now

112
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,440
Oh, now

113
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,400
Talk about the past

114
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,800
Oh, my friend

115
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,280
Oh, now

116
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,240
Oh, now back then

117
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,880
We are here

118
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,760
That makes the day

119
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,760
The goodness

120
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,680
But it

121
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:43,920
Yeah

122
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,640
Yeah

123
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,760
Oh, now

124
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,240
Yeah

125
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,840
Yes

126
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,980
Don't you diverge

127
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:59,800
All the fact that we are here

128
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:06,800
That makes a day of good day

129
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:14,800
No more life, the door to the bad, the bad day

130
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,800
No more life, all the fact that we are here

131
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,800
That means to take our door, our good day

132
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,800
I wish you could be here to see this

133
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,800
The sun just coming up in Northern California over the bay

134
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Looking out over the entire city from the 24th floor of the Curry condo

135
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
This is truly magical

136
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

137
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Yes indeed, it's bright and early on Tuesday morning

138
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Decided that I want to make this week

139
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,800
An early morning week, so we can kind of be kind of in sync with each other

140
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,800
I'm sorry for the European friends who are listening

141
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
You'll just have to get the show a little bit later

142
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
When you're at work or maybe on your drive home

143
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,800
You know, all this talk that we do about monetization

144
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,800
And sponsoring and advertising and selling songs on pod save music network

145
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,800
You know, it's emails like the one that I got from Mary Gautier, the one that I read

146
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Just in the intro of this song, that is the reason that I get up this early in the morning

147
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,800
You cannot, there is no bigger reward than with this stuff we're doing

148
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,800
For actually to hit home and make someone feel good

149
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Don't want to talk about the bad days

150
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,800
It's a good day just because we are here

151
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
That's the latest of the new dawn

152
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,800
The second song that I've played by them that I really really enjoy

153
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Hey everybody, sorry about yesterday

154
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Even though there's a lot of room noise here

155
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Especially because yesterday was president's day

156
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
I was thinking, oh, it's going to be great

157
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
I got in Sunday into the condo

158
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,800
After again an un-eventful yet lovely flight

159
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
I'm virgin upper class

160
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,800
And I was like, yeah, how Monday will be good

161
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,800
And it'll be president's day so I can take my time and I'll get a show out

162
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Well, it turns out that one of the, there was like that

163
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
We've had problems with this server before

164
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,800
The one that runs indiepotter.org and curry.com

165
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,800
I think it finally bit the big one

166
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,800
And of course this is one of the final legacy systems

167
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
It's always at the back of the list

168
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll migrate all that stuff one of these days

169
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Well, I guess we're forced to migrate now

170
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,800
So I spent most of the Sunday setting up WordPress

171
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Migrating everything over the archives of course

172
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Still on it there and it was bound to happen

173
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Oh, we just got to get in indiepotter.org back up and running

174
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
I know that Marcus was working

175
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,800
I went to bed last night he was still working on it

176
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
So that will be pretty soon and then we'll be back in rolling

177
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
That's just so much going on

178
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,800
So I'm here for the week and yesterday was, oh, it was just beautiful

179
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Although the power blew out a transformer exploded near the office

180
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,800
So that kind of bummed everybody out a lot of developers

181
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
It'd come into just work on some stuff

182
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Kind of a quiet day, no phones ringing

183
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
Kind of hanging out together

184
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
And so I did hook up with a couple of people

185
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
And we'll talk about that later on today

186
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Lots of audio feedback, lots of friends

187
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Checking back in with the show

188
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Some news about stuff that's coming up

189
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Oh my gosh, let me see a metro section moment

190
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Which turns out is loved by quite a bit of people

191
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Mail and female alike

192
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Despite all of the jokes that are being made about it in the potter sphere

193
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,800
And all the, I'd say the complimentary rip-offs

194
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Of the metro moment

195
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Maybe we should just make it the metro moment

196
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Maybe that's better than metro section moment

197
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
Because now there's the real man moment

198
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
And the macho moment and the heterosexual moment

199
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,800
But still the only original is to be found right here

200
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,800
And we'll continue some of the conversations that we had over the past week

201
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
One of them was about parenting

202
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,800
This is Koenberg from Holland, the land of the Sincere

203
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,800
I wanted to comment about what you said about

204
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,800
Let's just call it by name weed

205
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,800
When I was a teenager I lived in the States

206
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Columbia South Carolina to be exact

207
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,800
And I saw at high school more wheat than I did

208
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
When I went back to Holland

209
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Generally in Holland everybody had tried it

210
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,800
And it didn't find it very interesting

211
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,800
So I saw less people do it here than in the States

212
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,800
And I just wanted to let you know that

213
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Okay, I've been listening for about a year and I love your show

214
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
So keep on going

215
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Yo brother, thank you, oops

216
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
A little bit of dust there in the mixer

217
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Yeah, well, so that's kind of what we, oh man

218
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
There is a lot of dust in there

219
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
This is the, I think everyone pretty much agreed

220
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
At least the people who responded

221
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
That they're not making it a big deal

222
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Oh shoot, hold on let me just run this open

223
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Okay, here we go

224
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Time for a new mixer I guess

225
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
Gotta use that corporate card

226
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,800
Anyone who sent in any feedback about

227
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,800
About how Patricia and I are raising Christina

228
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
And for that I refer back to the show last week

229
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Oh shoot, what was it, when's it, when's it show I think we're talking about it

230
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
When you make these things just not a big deal

231
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
Turns out it's not a big deal

232
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
And you're right, when I went to college

233
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,800
And my college career lasted for all of three months

234
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
I went to West Virginia

235
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
And the reason why I went to West Virginia is because they would let

236
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Freshman on the radio station

237
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,800
So I was running the entire music department within two weeks

238
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
And running

239
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Not by title, but running a lot of the production

240
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,800
And really the on air

241
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
The on air production of the station

242
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
It was within the first few weeks

243
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
It was great, you know, because of course I'd come from

244
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Pirate radio stations and you know that

245
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,800
I had I knew how to queue up a record at least

246
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
These of course were the old days of the records

247
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,800
And I knew how to you know to fire up the transmitter in the morning

248
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,800
All ten watts of it, WITB, Salem, West Virginia

249
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:13,800
But yeah, it was there that

250
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Well, after those first couple of weeks and like man

251
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
Everyone here is just trying to smoke a lot

252
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Drink a lot and drive as fast as they can

253
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
And I did not appeal to me why?

254
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,800
Because I'd grown up with all those things

255
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Not being a big deal

256
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Let's see, I think I actually will skip this

257
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
I was going to play a little bit

258
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Why not?

259
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
I subscribed to the wired news podcasts

260
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,800
And I was blown away last night when one of them came through

261
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,800
Because it does say wired news podcasts

262
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
And you know why it usually has some pretty good stuff

263
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
But when I listened to it I was like wow

264
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,800
You know, this is either

265
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
Either their

266
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Well, you listen, listen to a little bit of this piece of

267
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Quote news and tell me what you think about it

268
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Howard by

269
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Sonobide

270
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Whatever sonobide is

271
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
So they have a little commercial beginning

272
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
I'm not not listening to this

273
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Yeah whoever, body we got some

274
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
So I'm arrogant

275
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Now check it out

276
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Listening post

277
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,800
By Elliot Van Busskirk

278
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Ever since computers picked up the handy ability

279
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
To play decent sounding music

280
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Fans have overwhelmingly defaulted to the MP3 format for audio files

281
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
Because it sounds pretty good

282
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
You have to live

283
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
I can't even play the rest of it

284
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
Because it sounds pretty good

285
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
No other reason

286
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
You got to listen to this

287
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
I don't think this is written by one of the editors

288
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
That actually writes for the magazine

289
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Maybe it is

290
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,800
But man full of all kinds of factual mistakes

291
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
And just this guy reading with this

292
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
With that same voice going on and on

293
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
That's much more on and on

294
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
Perhaps most importantly

295
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Works with more devices than any other digital audio format

296
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
So there's a

297
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
I should and you know what I'm going to do

298
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
I'm going to pull some pieces from that

299
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,800
And use that isn't open or works with more devices than any other audio format

300
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
Yes indeed

301
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Kind of weird what the guy is over at wire to doing

302
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
I couldn't get through the whole thing

303
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,800
I actually fell asleep with the power book on my chest

304
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
In bed last night

305
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
At nine o'clock

306
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Let me tell you

307
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
And I really again

308
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,800
The sun is just coming up over the bay

309
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
It's shining through the condo

310
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
There's this kind of orange

311
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Just a reddish glow

312
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
And people are coming off the bay bridge

313
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
And the day has started

314
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,800
And it will be another sunny day in northern California

315
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,800
With some good news for those of you

316
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,800
Of the back persuasion

317
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
I had a name, my name is Basil and I'm from Belgium

318
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,800
And I sent you this audio comment to regarding your power book

319
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
Sound problem

320
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,800
I call reports that this problem should be fixed

321
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
From version 10 to 4 to 5

322
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,800
But you can download from software upgrade

323
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
So I hope you try it out

324
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,800
Because I want to know if it's really fixed or not

325
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,800
I think a lot of listeners would like it this as well

326
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,800
And I'm also a fan of the power book recording

327
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Because the volume of the power book recordings

328
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,800
It's much better than the crossblaster version

329
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,800
I listen to the Charlie everyday in the subway

330
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
And half of the time

331
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
I can't hear your voice

332
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Because of the ambient noise of the Metro

333
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
And the people around me

334
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,800
So I hope you either raise the volume

335
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
Of your recording in crossblaster

336
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Or go back to the power book version

337
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Where the sound was much much louder

338
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
So that's all for now

339
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,800
I hope you're playing this comment

340
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
See you

341
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Bye

342
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Yep

343
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Okay, nice fade

344
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
Yeah

345
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Well, I've loaded it

346
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
It came

347
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
You don't have to do anything

348
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
If you have a power book

349
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,800
It comes with

350
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
What is it?

351
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
The upgrade 10.4.5

352
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
And so far

353
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
And I've loaded it on the power book

354
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
So far, no problems at all

355
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
I've not had the audio looping

356
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
But I must say in the interim

357
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,800
I've grown so attached to the setup with Cast Blaster

358
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
And I do agree with you on the volume

359
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
And I'm still trying to figure out

360
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Just what is the sweet spot

361
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
Where how high I can turn this thing

362
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
Because basically

363
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
The meters are hitting

364
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800
0 dB all the time

365
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,800
Which is the end of the scale on Cast Blaster

366
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
I think I'm there

367
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
I've been working with PW Fenton

368
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
He says that I'm really at the max there

369
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Of what I can reach with volume

370
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
So I'm not quite sure why it's still

371
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
Is softer than the power book version

372
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
Excuse me

373
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
No, I'm not going to say it

374
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
Use your own imagination

375
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
And I really do

376
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
I don't know, I'm just digging it

377
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
And there's all kinds of little things

378
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,800
And issues that are being worked on

379
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,800
And I actually have some feedback about that in this show

380
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
Well, let's get to it right now

381
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Because there's some good and some bad

382
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Check this out

383
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Hello

384
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Ah, yes

385
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Hi Adam, this is Tom from the Fog View podcast

386
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,800
I'd like to publicly thank Cast Blaster Mike for his great Cast Blaster program

387
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
I just recorded my first podcast

388
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,800
And used the podfather edition of Cast Blaster to do it

389
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,800
My first podcast is a little rougher on the edges

390
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
But once Mike improves Cast Blaster

391
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
And sure it'll sound much better

392
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,800
Just kidding Mike

393
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
What's great about Cast Blaster is all the support

394
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
And the Cast Blaster forms

395
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,800
And how fast Mike responds to problems

396
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,800
And supplies updates

397
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Just along with the podsaic music network

398
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,800
Provides a great set of resources for

399
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
Often coming podcasters like myself

400
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Many thanks to you and the podcasting community

401
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,800
So the great work and support in this exciting new media

402
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
If you'd like to hear what a first time podcaster sounds like

403
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,800
You can check out my podcast at www.fogview.com

404
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Sternwinds Adam

405
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
What was that?

406
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
What did you say?

407
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
Did you say Stern?

408
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
I didn't hear that

409
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Let me just check that whole

410
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,800
Let me just get to the end there

411
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
Oh my god

412
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
My podcast at www.fogview.com

413
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Sternwinds Adam

414
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Sternwinds

415
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Hmm, it's a little different from tailwinds

416
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
You know, I only mentioned that once or twice

417
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
That I feel that you can only with someone tailwinds

418
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
If they're pilot and not just about every single email

419
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,800
I get as either saying, okay

420
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
I can't say tailwinds

421
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Or you know my dad's a pilot

422
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
So I get to say half a tailwinds

423
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
I don't know if you saw a curry dot

424
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Call my post to the picture of the Delta Sherry Delta Sherry

425
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
Delta Sherry

426
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
My airplane, which is now being rebuilt

427
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
It's getting the black edition engine

428
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
All new interior. I'm very excited about it

429
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
I might even be able to test fly it

430
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Next Monday or Tuesday

431
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
As I get back Sunday

432
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Then I'm going to the Netherlands

433
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
On Monday because I have this

434
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Remember the court case against the paparazzi magazine

435
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
The

436
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
The gossip rag

437
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
So that serves Tuesday

438
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
I'm not sure is it I think late morning

439
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Or early afternoon in Amsterdam

440
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,800
And then with a little bit of luck

441
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Because the wind commander will meet me somewhere

442
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,800
And we'll go flying because it has to do like

443
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
15 hours of him flying it

444
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Before he's completely convinced that everything is good

445
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
And before we take it across

446
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
Stuff like oh I don't know like water

447
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
Maybe just a thought there

448
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Direct from a small water cooler

449
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
Located inside the voice booth

450
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Cross-gear to New Zealand

451
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Beams directly around the globe

452
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
To all of the seven continents

453
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
And all way through the galaxy

454
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
Informing an entertaining millions along the way

455
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,800
This is the amazing water cooler podcast

456
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Join David Toby for juicy gossip

457
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Amazing interviews

458
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Monster music mashups

459
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
Everything else important happening in the world

460
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
And beyond

461
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
The water cooler podcast

462
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
One small step for men

463
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,800
One giant leap for podcasting

464
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
A podcast for the voice booth

465
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
Don't come

466
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,800
New Zealand's leading podcasting network

467
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
Dude since say it will also come in D-caf

468
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Just say you know

469
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
I've got a special call coming up

470
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,800
From one of our favorites today on the source code

471
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,800
Don't go skip in ahead to it because there's a lot more in the mean time

472
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
Including a metro moment

473
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
But before we get to that

474
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Yes, it's spreading far and wide

475
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
This piece comes from

476
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Ant Barnes

477
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Ant and Ant Barnes

478
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Who found a nice spoof ad on the

479
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,800
What is it the cymochrome podcast?

480
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Cymochrome cymolycrum

481
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
So how's the more cymolycrum?

482
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
My brother

483
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
The cymolycrum podcast

484
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Is your shave still not close enough?

485
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
But despite the constant pampering and vanity products

486
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
You still feel all man

487
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
Well McWilkow saw turbo have the razor for you

488
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,800
On you 94 blade razor

489
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
Shaved so close you can see bone

490
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
And are unique contours

491
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
Make it perfect for the back crack and sack

492
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
Listen to my authority and enthusiasm

493
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Is this a man that can't be bothered to lacerate his face daily?

494
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
I think not

495
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,800
This is the ultimate shave for where 93 blades just aren't enough

496
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
The new McWilkow saw turbo 94

497
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Our best ever razor

498
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
What could we ever do to better it?

499
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Metrosexual

500
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,800
Metrosexual

501
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
Metrosexual

502
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Metrosexual

503
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,800
It's Adam Curry's

504
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,800
Metrosexual moment

505
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
Yeah I've been up here

506
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,800
And Curry's Metrosexual moment

507
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,800
Yeah

508
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Adam says Phil Walker

509
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Time for a new subject for the Metrosexual moment

510
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
How about the underwear debate?

511
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Oh man

512
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
I knew it was going to pop up eventually

513
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Breeze versus wife runs versus boxers versus free balling

514
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,800
I know my life would be much better for an in-depth analysis

515
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Of the pros and cons of this vexing question

516
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,800
Again, the categories are briefs versus wife runs

517
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,800
Versus boxers versus free balling

518
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,800
Well, then I might as well come clean myself

519
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
I'm definitely

520
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
I guess a white a white front is

521
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Yeah, I guess I have a white front

522
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Is a white front kind of like a boxer that hugs you more tightly

523
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Is that what that is?

524
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
Because I'm not into the briefs

525
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
And that's just because uncomfortable

526
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,800
You know, it's like the male version of a thong

527
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
Only you don't show it

528
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
And that's probably really a good thing

529
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
So let's find out what our source code

530
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Audiences into

531
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Again, briefs versus wife runs versus boxers versus free balling

532
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,800
And since we have plenty of female listeners

533
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
As you'll find out in a few moments

534
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
You might as well

535
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,800
If you're a woman, you might as well tell us what you think is

536
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Hot sexy or what the Metroman should be wearing

537
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,800
Mark Kelso, pops in, Adam wanted to give you thumbs up

538
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
On the Frank feedback regarding raising your daughter

539
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Yep, no one can doubt the love you share

540
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
My wife and I are blessed with a daughter

541
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Who although has not seen a smoke has seen a strength

542
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,800
The difference simply is drinking as worse yet

543
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
No kidding

544
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,800
Now I'd like to hear from listeners on how to keep a good go-to go-to

545
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
But I hear you talk about the right razor

546
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
What makes a good moustache and go-to

547
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
How long should it be?

548
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
How thick should one wear it?

549
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Best wishes looking forward to your uncles interview

550
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,800
Yeah, you know, the Uncle Don thing is really caught fire

551
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Everyone's talking about it

552
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
I'm very excited about getting that interview

553
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,800
And Denise Howell, who I believe is from baggin' baggage

554
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,800
Who is an attorney, says, hey Adam

555
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Further to your theme of paying close attention

556
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,800
To wives and girlfriends product stash

557
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,800
And of course this is what I've suggested to all of you

558
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
If you want to look for the right stuff

559
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
You want to go into your wife or your girlfriends

560
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
Bathroom cabinet there

561
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,800
And you want to take her moisturizers

562
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,800
Because that is the real shit

563
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,800
I've been a long time fan of

564
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
Outturners straightening balm

565
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,800
It's a superb tamer of the frizzies

566
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,800
Better still?

567
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
It just taught me this morning

568
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,800
The whole bloody line is made with hemp

569
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Wow, okay, so we can straighten the hair

570
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,800
And feel good at the same time

571
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
And of course Denise ends it up there with

572
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
What big hair'd fag could do without

573
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
I agree Denise

574
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Okay, so you got lots of homework for this week

575
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
Regarding the metro section moment

576
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,800
Those of you checking this out on serious stars

577
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
103

578
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,800
We have the Hellway next specific coast

579
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,800
Hellway and on the Gilmore daily today

580
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
For the first time in public

581
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,800
I hear Steve Gilmore drops the F-bomb on Doxero

582
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Stay tuned for that

583
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
It's all coming up here on 103

584
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
And we'll continue

585
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
Right now

586
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
On the podcast

587
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,800
Because I got at least another 15-20 minutes to go

588
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Let's see

589
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,800
There was Alistair Jenks sent me a link

590
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,800
About mainstream media and music cannibalism

591
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Now we touched on this before

592
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
And I've heard a lot of

593
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,800
I've actually got a lot of

594
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
Music industry

595
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Like folks who've talked about this with me

596
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,800
This is from Macworld

597
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
And the title written by Johnny Evans

598
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Is iTunes steals music

599
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
Music's soul

600
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,800
And what's happening now

601
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Is that record companies are becoming

602
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,800
Increasingly dissatisfied

603
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,800
With the sale of single tracks

604
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,800
Because they feel as cannibalizing the product

605
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Which they've always sold up until now

606
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,800
Which of course is albums

607
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,800
And although I don't have any numbers to back it up

608
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Apparently they're holding songs back

609
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
They're not putting songs on the iTunes

610
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
And this is really, I mean this is changing

611
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
Very quickly right before our very eyes

612
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,800
There's all kinds of movement going on in the music industry

613
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,800
And meanwhile we're just kind of

614
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,800
Puttering around, you know, going around

615
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
That if you've been to the podcast

616
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,800
MusicNetwork of Music.podshow.com

617
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
You'll see that

618
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,800
There are little bylinks

619
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Now each to next to each individual track

620
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
They're not activated yet

621
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
Because we're definitely in beta

622
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,800
We're barely out of alpha on this stuff

623
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,800
And all man Chris Rocco was so pissed at me

624
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,800
Oh boy

625
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,800
He said, well, you know, next time you tell your listeners

626
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,800
To go check and see if this stuff works

627
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
Tell me ahead of time

628
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
Dude

629
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
So sorry

630
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Because he's actually done a fantastic job

631
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Very intricate

632
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
And making the user experience work

633
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Particularly the sign up

634
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,800
Because, you know, basically what's happening

635
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,800
If you're not a registered listener

636
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Of the podcast music network

637
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,800
You have to basically sign up for the podcast music network

638
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
So we can help you track all of your downloads

639
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,800
And nice little handy store

640
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
These are all MP3s free and clear

641
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,800
So you can download them as often as you want

642
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
And put them on any of your devices

643
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
You're only going to pay for it once

644
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
Lost my train of thought

645
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,800
This sun just hit me in the eyes again

646
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Yeah

647
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,800
So the only one that's active now

648
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,800
I think is pod safe for peace

649
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
If every day we're quite Christmas

650
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Which of course is

651
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,800
You know, it's not really a Christmas

652
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,800
It's not really that time of year

653
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
But it is a great song to test stuff out with

654
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,800
And we've all been doing it because all the money goes to unice

655
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,800
And we're just going to keep it going

656
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,800
Keep the feedback reports coming in

657
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800
I've got one here from Australia

658
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
Which was kind of interesting

659
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
Hi Adam, Steve Springl here

660
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,800
Just a little bit of feedback regarding

661
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Purchases of the PMN

662
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
Just thought I'd give it a try

663
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
And buy pod safer for peace

664
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
And

665
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,800
Shut me off to click and buy

666
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,800
To put my career card details in

667
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
Because I'm not already a customer

668
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
It asked me for my details

669
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
I put those in

670
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,800
And then it basically said

671
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,800
Your account's not activated yet

672
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
And you need to call us between

673
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,800
8am and 6pm during weekdays

674
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,800
Well, that's not much good

675
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,800
I don't really like that idea

676
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,800
It means now I can't make a purchase

677
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
And as an Australian

678
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,800
It means I've got to ring an international number

679
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,800
To activate the account

680
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,800
It's a Sunday here

681
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,800
So I can't do it today

682
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
I'm going to have to wait till next week

683
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,800
It just makes the experience

684
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,800
It's not such a good experience

685
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,800
So anyway, some feedback for you

686
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
From an Australian

687
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
Trying to put

688
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
Find music

689
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Off the pod safe music network

690
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
See you later

691
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
Enjoy your show

692
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Catch you next time

693
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
All right, it's mate

694
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
Okay, so we looked into this

695
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
And here's the best we can come up with

696
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,800
Because this is supposed to work worldwide

697
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,800
And we have had other people

698
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
able to purchase from Australia

699
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,800
From New Zealand

700
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,800
From other spots in the Pacific Rim

701
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
Excuse me

702
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
So the closest I can come up with

703
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,800
Is that there may be just an issue with your credit card

704
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Maybe

705
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,800
Who knows

706
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
I mean, this shit happens all the time

707
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
I've seen the richest men in the world

708
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
Have their credit card

709
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
You know, run into problems and restaurants

710
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
And you know, particularly when it's

711
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,800
Cross country purchases

712
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,800
So I would really appreciate

713
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,800
If you did call into them

714
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
Did find out what the reason was

715
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Why they wanted you to call

716
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,800
Because this is not the default behavior

717
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
Of clicking by

718
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
Who is the partner that we're working with on this

719
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,800
And just to reiterate one more time

720
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,800
We're not building a store

721
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
We're not replicating iTunes

722
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,800
All we're doing is adding a little bit of functionality

723
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,800
And we want to just make it as safe as possible

724
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
For everybody that's why we chose a partner

725
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
That has a great reputation

726
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
The drawback

727
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,800
But of course, your own security

728
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Is that you have to create a separate password

729
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
Separate from your

730
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
Login at the pod set music network

731
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Which of course, you can store on your computer

732
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,800
So you won't have to enter it again

733
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,800
We have to do that for security reasons

734
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
Because we don't want your credit card information

735
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
That's all going through clicking by

736
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
If there are any other issues

737
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
Then please let us know

738
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,800
We're working on some silly stuff

739
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,800
When you sign up you get like 3, 3,000 emails

740
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,800
From clicking by

741
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
That's very confusing

742
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,800
So we are trying to make the experience better

743
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,800
And once you're logged in

744
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,800
I really hope that it works out for you

745
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,800
Because we have gotten

746
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
All kinds of varying response

747
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
And the good news is

748
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,800
Just about everybody is actually able to buy

749
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
And to download

750
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,800
And to go back and go into your cubby hole

751
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,800
There on on PMN

752
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,800
And retrieve it

753
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,800
And download it again to different devices

754
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,800
So all that's working

755
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
But just credit cards

756
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
There's always some crap going on somewhere

757
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
But thanks for the feedback

758
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
And keep it coming

759
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
Adam

760
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,800
This is Matt Campbell

761
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
And I'm a relatively new listener

762
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
With the Charlie as you like to say

763
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
And I've been noticing lately a problem

764
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
With your audio setup

765
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,800
Where when playing music

766
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
The playback will speed up

767
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
For a fraction of a second

768
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
And then return to its normal rate

769
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,800
Now I'm going to show you a couple of clips

770
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
Where I've observed this

771
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,800
First in DSC333

772
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
During I wonder

773
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
By Natalie Brown at the end of the show

774
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,800
And I heard this

775
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,800
In the fourth time she sings the chorus

776
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,800
After the second verse

777
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
And you can hear it in the strings

778
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,800
Just before she sings

779
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,800
I wonder

780
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,800
I'll play this twice

781
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,800
Time and space

782
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,800
I wonder

783
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,800
Time and space

784
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,800
I wonder

785
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
I don't know, man

786
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,800
That's why you can hear the pitch

787
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,800
Goes up just a little

788
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,800
And then returns to normal

789
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
Now I also heard this

790
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,800
On DSC338

791
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,800
During not on the radio

792
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
By Jeff Smith

793
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
This time it's in the bridge

794
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,800
And you can hear it in the piano

795
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
Just before

796
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,800
I'm just better

797
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
I'll play this twice

798
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
Maybe

799
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
I'm just middle

800
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
What you say

801
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
Maybe

802
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,800
Maybe

803
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,800
I'm just middle

804
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,800
What you say

805
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
I heard it there

806
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
Again the pitch went up a little

807
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,800
And then returns to normal

808
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,800
So as you can hear this isn't an isolated incident

809
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,800
But a recurring problem

810
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,800
I think I also heard this on

811
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,800
334 and 336

812
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,800
But I figured two clips would do it

813
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,800
So that's all I have for now

814
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
Keep up the great work

815
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
Alright man, thank you

816
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
You know what?

817
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,800
You would do me a great service

818
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
By posting

819
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
Any time you hear something as a listener

820
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Going over to castblaster.com

821
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
And posting something in the forums

822
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
Because that's

823
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
And I've got to get in the forum as well

824
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,800
Just to get some feedback going

825
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,800
And some really good conversation happening there

826
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
Also stuff about accessibility

827
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
For blind podcasters

828
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
So they can use it

829
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
And I think Mike has actually put out

830
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
Yet another beta

831
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
Addition

832
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,800
Which now has some form of accessibility

833
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,800
At least I heard Darrell talking about it

834
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
So I guess it's getting better

835
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
But any type of feedback

836
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
And this is a weird one

837
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
I have no idea what that is

838
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,800
It could be so many different things

839
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,800
It could be your player

840
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
Although I think I heard this before myself

841
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,800
And wanted to other people who have mentioned it

842
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,800
And of course, often I'm just sitting

843
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Dude, you know

844
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,800
Maybe it's just the stuff I'm smoking

845
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,800
That makes it all warm

846
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,800
Hey, happy

847
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,800
What you doing?

848
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
Oh my computer is so slow

849
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,800
I'm bogged down in spyware

850
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
I spend hours deleting spam

851
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,800
This is no information super highway

852
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
This is a dead end street

853
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
Well happy

854
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,800
You need to try a airplane

855
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,800
Yes, Earthlink

856
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,800
Earthlink's protection control center

857
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
It gives you automatic updates

858
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,800
To help keep your computer protected from the latest threats

859
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,800
Earthlink stands for both viruses and spyware

860
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
And Earthlink's next generation software

861
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
The lot's viruses and spyware

862
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,800
Be sure they install on your PC

863
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Can I get on the super information highway with Earthlink?

864
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,800
Sure

865
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,800
Get in

866
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,800
I love Earthlink

867
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,800
Earthlink

868
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,800
We revolve around you

869
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
That's the gofers from bedtime stories

870
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
I tell my kids

871
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
Okay, so folks thinking about it

872
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,800
Thinking about the New Earthlink campaign

873
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
Today Tuesday we have our meeting

874
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,800
We're going to be talking about all the

875
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,800
All the different thoughts that we've been discussing here on the show

876
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,800
Because now finally

877
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,800
After, well really, only after two months

878
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,800
Time of all the feedback

879
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,800
And all the

880
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Sometimes even the flaming about the Earthlink campaign

881
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,800
That's been running on the pod show pod castle network

882
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,800
We now get to turn it around

883
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,800
And we get to decide how we're going to do this

884
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
What is the perfect user generated

885
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,800
The listener advertiser

886
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
What the hell do you want to hear

887
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,800
And you know what?

888
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
It's not just me and you, my friends

889
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,800
There's more people thinking very, very seriously about this stuff

890
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,800
Yeah, you're ready

891
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,800
Yeah

892
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,800
Yeah, there's another message

893
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,800
Wrong

894
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,800
Rajas

895
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,800
It's my body

896
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
It's my body

897
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,800
It's my body

898
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,800
It's my body

899
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
Rajas

900
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,800
Fuck

901
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,800
Hey, I've been running here

902
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,800
As you're asking for people's record

903
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
Some Earthlink commercials

904
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
I thought I'd have to go

905
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
Haven't got any musical sound effects

906
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,800
I'm afraid

907
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,800
Hopefully this will sound okay

908
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,800
And I should have done a much bad advertising

909
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,800
But I've heard the sex cell products

910
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,800
Not talking about viruses and scammers

911
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
Because when you think about it

912
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,800
If you get some idiot paying $10 million to the print in Nigeria

913
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,800
Just to buy some bagra

914
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,800
And if they're on steepest bullets to get ripped off

915
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,800
You should remember that there's only one time that people

916
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,800
wished to have a fast room or private internet connection

917
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
And that's when they're hunched over a keyboard

918
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,800
Where you can put two meg file called

919
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,800
That's scared

920
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,800
So MPs download and Windows media player

921
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,800
You really ought to try and appeal to that side of the market

922
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,800
And try sexy things

923
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,800
Don't try rewriting it

924
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
Hold on

925
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,800
He wants to download porn quickly

926
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,800
Then you can wank

927
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
We do

928
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
We're a slink

929
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,800
He wants a horn

930
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,800
They give it a net unicorn on our panradverse

931
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
We do

932
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,800
We're a slink

933
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,800
Haven't noticed how it's the men in the house

934
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
So the film needs to upgrade the broadband

935
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,800
We do

936
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,800
We're a slink

937
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,800
Go on and visit airslink.net

938
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,800
And put some letting it pencil

939
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
Just slink

940
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
Because we revolve around men

941
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
And say she will appetite to download

942
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,800
Naked pictures

943
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Quicker than you can say

944
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
The enemy's prison sentence

945
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,800
I think he just needs a bit more money

946
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,800
Than tell it like it is

947
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
Anyway, give it a happy back in the country

948
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
And make the wind be with you

949
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
He ain't gross

950
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
Ha ha ha ha

951
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Our Roger man

952
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,800
I love you

953
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,800
I'm so happy you're thinking about this stuff

954
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
And I'm sorry we haven't

955
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
We haven't hooked up for lunch yet

956
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
The travel's just been a little bit crazy

957
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,800
But I love it

958
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,800
You've got the little sound effect there

959
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,800
The bell

960
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,800
For sound linking

961
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,800
Soundvertising

962
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,800
You've used all the principles

963
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
And of course the honesty and advertising

964
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,800
I will definitely

965
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,800
Use this today in our conversation Roger

966
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,800
No doubt about it

967
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,800
And I think the real key here

968
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,800
To this stuff is having variation

969
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
Having variations on a theme

970
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,800
I mean I'd love to have a hundred different earth linked spots

971
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,800
You know all different, all appealing

972
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,800
To different people for different reasons

973
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,800
And I think yours definitely belongs there

974
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,800
Roger

975
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,800
You are a true friend for working on this with me

976
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
Yeah

977
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,800
Roger

978
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,800
Daddy John

979
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,800
Is another message from

980
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Rages

981
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,800
Rages

982
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Rages

983
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
Names

984
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Hey Adam, this is Chris from Chicago

985
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,800
Just listening to your Friday, February 17th

986
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
D.S.C.

987
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,800
And just wondering if Uncle Don may have gotten to Rumsfeld

988
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,800
You know you were talking about the war

989
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,800
And the way that you know our government

990
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
Is not adapting to this media age

991
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,800
And you know Rumsfeld basically came out today

992
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,800
And said you know

993
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,800
Our enemies are skillfully adapted to fighting wars

994
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
And today's media age

995
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
But our country is not adapted

996
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
For the most part the US government still

997
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
Functions is a fine with a dime store

998
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
In an eBay world so you know

999
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
Go Uncle Don

1000
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,800
And you know at the same time

1001
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,800
I don't necessarily think that

1002
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,800
Putting pictures of our dead soldiers

1003
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,800
On the front of

1004
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,800
You know the New York Times for instances

1005
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,800
I'm really going to do anything to help

1006
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,800
I think of anything

1007
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,800
We are media here

1008
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
Definitely shield us from that

1009
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,800
But at the same time they are not telling us

1010
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
The good things that are going on over there

1011
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
I know people in the military

1012
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,800
And they see far more successes than failures

1013
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,800
Going on over there

1014
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,800
Although all we ever hear about

1015
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,800
Is the failures

1016
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,800
So anyway keep up the good work

1017
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,800
And tail

1018
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,800
Oh I'm not a pilot

1019
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,800
Yep, watch yourself now

1020
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,800
You know I agree with you

1021
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,800
Of course with the bad should also come the good

1022
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,800
But let's do both of them

1023
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,800
And I believe that

1024
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,800
Well first I know first hand that there's

1025
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,800
A lot of great work has been done in Iraq

1026
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,800
Because I visited there myself in April of 2004

1027
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,800
At Camp Smitty in Asimaba

1028
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
In Iraq so that's the

1029
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,800
About the western part of Iraq

1030
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,800
Still a good 150 miles from Baghdad though

1031
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,800
And yeah I mean there is

1032
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,800
The reporting really does seem to be only about the failures

1033
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,800
I was just saying

1034
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,800
And now that we know based upon

1035
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,800
The interviews that I've seen

1036
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,800
First hand interviews with the editor

1037
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,800
Of the Danish newspaper who started the whole cartoon

1038
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,800
Controversy

1039
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
It literally was done as a

1040
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
You know

1041
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,800
How did he put it?

1042
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,800
I wish I could quote him directly

1043
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
But he said look

1044
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,800
He didn't want any religious group ever

1045
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,800
Making his editors and his journalists

1046
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,800
Participate in self-censorship

1047
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,800
So he said we're not going to do self-censorship

1048
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800
We're going to put out there what we feel we should put out there

1049
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,800
Which of course basically you can insult any group of people

1050
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,800
Very very easily with any type of cartoon

1051
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,800
And you'd probably get

1052
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,800
What I don't think you get the same reaction

1053
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
Not as violent

1054
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,800
But you know there's a lot of other stuff here at play

1055
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,800
So my whole point was look

1056
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,800
If you want to do some shocking stuff

1057
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,800
Then do some shocking stuff

1058
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,800
And why don't you put dead soldiers dead coalition soldiers

1059
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,800
Put pictures up there

1060
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,800
Of what it looks like when someone's killed

1061
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,800
Don't just put it into a couple of words

1062
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,800
And say you know an IED

1063
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,800
Took out

1064
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
You know a tank

1065
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,800
You know a troop carrier

1066
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
And ten people died

1067
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,800
You know that just doesn't cut it

1068
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,800
That's not shocking enough

1069
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,800
You know

1070
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
Just turn on the TV

1071
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,800
And you can see the kind of stuff that we're used to

1072
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,800
So that was my point

1073
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,800
But then also indeed there also should be

1074
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,800
Which I'm sure people immediately would call

1075
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
Fluff stories

1076
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,800
But there has been a great amount of

1077
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,800
Good work done in Iraq

1078
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
Of course at the end of it all

1079
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,800
And this is the stuff that we'll be talking about

1080
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
With Uncle Don

1081
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
He made it very very clear to me

1082
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,800
He said look every single administration

1083
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,800
The administration always goes to the intelligence units

1084
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,800
To the intelligence community

1085
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,800
And ask them to back up the policy that they're putting in place

1086
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,800
With intelligence

1087
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,800
And boy did that happen with Iraq

1088
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,800
So I guess I guess we'll just have to wait a couple more weeks

1089
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,800
But Uncle Don was very excited about doing it

1090
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,800
And so am I because I think this might even have to be a multiple parts to hear

1091
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,800
He's just because there's so much to talk about

1092
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,800
Along those lines I've really been thinking about

1093
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,800
Doing some different stuff with the Charlie

1094
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Obviously I want to keep the

1095
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,800
Pods have music going and the feedback

1096
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,800
And the metro moments and all the stuff that we're talking about

1097
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,800
But from time to time

1098
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,800
Where you know I haven't actually done a sound seeing tour

1099
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,800
And a while I should do one of those

1100
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,800
But I want to get some other topics going here

1101
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,800
And I want to have other people on the show

1102
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,800
Because I like talking to people

1103
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
I keep noticing that time and time again

1104
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
When I'm talking with Patricia

1105
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800
Just how much fun it is

1106
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,800
Just to have a conversation with no limits and boundaries

1107
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,800
On language and time

1108
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,800
And are one of our investors

1110
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,800
Who invested in Pods Show

1111
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
While we're in New York they announced something very interesting

1112
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,800
And investment fund

1113
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
And I guess I'll have to ask right off the bat

1114
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,800
And when I do this interview

1115
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,800
I'll have to ask how that works

1116
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,800
And how did the investment funds work

1117
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,800
Because you know it may just not be very clear

1118
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
But at any rate there's two hundred million dollars

1119
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,800
For this fund which means it will be invested

1120
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
And it's called the pandemic preparedness

1121
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,800
Biodefense fund

1122
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,800
And essentially what I can gather from the press release

1123
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,800
Is that they believe

1124
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,800
The Asian the Avian bird flu

1125
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,800
Will eventually start spreading from human to human

1126
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
And I'm sure you see I was it was it

1127
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,800
Maybe it was 60 minutes the other day

1128
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,800
That did this whole thing about you know

1129
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,800
How easily you know a minimum of two

1130
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,800
But maybe 10 million people in the United States

1131
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,800
Could be killed if it started to spread from human to human

1132
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,800
I guess that kind of betting on this actually happening

1133
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,800
And they don't see the government being able to respond quick enough

1134
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,800
And so they started an investment fund

1135
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,800
A commercial fund mind you

1136
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,800
To protect the citizens of the world

1137
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,800
And it sounds so controversial

1138
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,800
You know I'm like two hundred million dollars

1139
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,800
Not a lot of money when it comes to you know

1140
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,800
And the scheme of big things look at what we're spending in Iraq

1141
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,800
You know what is the government not capable of doing this

1142
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,800
What happens if it never

1143
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,800
If there is never a pandemic

1144
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,800
Do investors in the funds still make money

1145
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,800
I mean what what are the long-term goals of this

1146
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,800
It was just it crunched my brain

1147
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,800
And so I'm going to interview

1148
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,800
Brookbires one of the

1149
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,800
The partners whose name is on the door

1150
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,800
Kleiner Perkins

1151
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,800
Callfield buyers

1152
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,800
Brookbires and I think we get some other people on

1153
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,800
And this is actually going to be a first time recording

1154
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,800
With Skype and cast blaster and routing through the mixer

1155
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,800
So hopefully it'll all work out

1156
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,800
I'm going to record that for tomorrow's show

1157
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,800
And let's see if we can get a conversation started with that

1158
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,800
Because I just find it phenomenally fascinating

1159
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,800
It was actually in the New York Times

1160
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,800
It was like Tuesday or Wednesday

1161
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,800
It was on the front page was this

1162
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,800
Like a half page picture of birds being called

1163
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,800
And you know there's now been reports in France

1164
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,800
Of course it started kind of in Turkey

1165
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,800
Even the UK now birds are being brought indoors

1166
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,800
So this thing is definitely spreading

1167
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,800
It's still going bird to bird

1168
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,800
But if it goes bird to human

1169
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,800
Which it does actually

1170
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,800
I've actually know a guy who got bird flu

1171
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,800
He lived but he was pretty damn sick

1172
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,800
And of course the big fear is person to person

1173
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,800
So we can get the word from some experts

1174
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
People who in fact are

1175
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,800
Believe they're so educated in the matter

1176
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,800
That they're going public with this fund

1177
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,800
And taking money from people to invest in it

1178
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,800
So I kind of freaked me out

1179
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
I was also on the other hand

1180
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,800
I was very happy I'm thinking

1181
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,800
Well you know if this shit does hit the fan

1182
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,800
God that's that's cool that I know these guys

1183
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,800
Because I probably can get first

1184
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,800
Why?

1185
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,800
Hey thanks everybody for sending in the information

1186
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,800
About David Letterman's microphone

1187
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,800
I asked if that was a high LPR 40

1188
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,800
The same microphone I'm using right now

1189
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,800
PW summed it up the best

1190
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,800
PW Fenton said here's the story

1191
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,800
As well as I can piece it together

1192
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,800
For many years going back to his NBC show

1193
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,800
David has used an antique RCA DX77 ribbon microphone

1194
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,800
On his desk that was given to him as a gift

1195
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,800
By the crew when he left NBC

1196
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,800
It was the mic originally used by Jack PAR

1197
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,800
The model is highly treasured and is still used

1198
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,800
Yeah I think that's the black one I think

1199
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,800
That was kind of tilted back on his desk

1200
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,800
Not too long ago apparently

1201
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,800
It was reportedly stolen from his set

1202
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,800
And it's now been replaced with a high LPR 40

1203
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,800
In both cases it's only there as a prop

1204
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,800
What you hear on the show is either a mic that he wears

1205
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,800
Or a boom mic just out of sight

1206
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,800
The desk mic is never live

1207
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,800
Some reports say it's wired as a backup

1208
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,800
But he beat up doubts it

1209
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,800
I doubt it as well

1210
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,800
Because this is not the type of microphone

1211
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,800
That really works from

1212
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,800
It's meant for close mic operation

1213
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,800
Really I think these type of mics

1214
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,800
We're originally built for recording kick drums on drum kit

1215
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,800
Continuing PWM says I believe the desk mic is there

1216
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,800
And silent tribute to Johnny Carson who always had a desk mic

1217
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,800
Which wasn't used for on air sound either

1218
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,800
Carson's mic was a shoe or model SM33 ribbon

1219
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,800
Made especially for him

1220
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,800
It had an inscription on it

1221
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,800
Johnny's mic

1222
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,800
Not Ed's

1223
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,800
Not Fred's

1224
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,800
Sure wanted to be sure it got to Johnny

1225
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,800
That mic saved from the trash by the boom operator

1226
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,800
That worked on the Carson show was auctioned

1227
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,800
And sold for 50,787

1228
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,800
Dollars doing anonymous bitter

1229
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,800
Which of course some folks believe was David Letterman

1230
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,800
And just about everybody sent in a similar story

1231
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,800
But PW really

1232
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,800
Really summed it up perfectly

1233
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,800
Thanks buddy appreciate it

1234
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,800
Hi Adam, it's Derek Kay Miller from the Penn Machine podcast

1235
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,800
Once again

1236
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,800
And I got a couple things for you

1237
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,800
And then I got a promo that if you want

1238
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,800
We'll segue fabulously into the Metro section moment

1239
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,800
So if you want to do all those, let's see what happens

1240
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,800
Anyway the first thing is Letterman and the PR40 mic

1241
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,800
I heard somewhere

1242
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,800
I think it was on this week in tech a few weeks ago

1243
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,800
That yes Letterman does use a PR40 on his desk

1244
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,800
And it is pointed toward the guests chair

1245
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,800
Not at him

1246
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,800
And the reason for that is apparently the guests

1247
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,800
Where a little tyclip level ear mic

1248
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,800
But sometimes when they get a little crazy

1249
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,800
You know you got Jim Carrey on there or something

1250
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,800
They'll jump around and that mic will become disconnected

1251
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,800
Then they can flip on the PR40

1252
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,800
And it will pick up their voice

1253
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,800
Most of the time it's off

1254
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,800
So you can, you know, do the old Johnny Carson tap as pencil on there

1255
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,800
The second thing is a nomdex

1256
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,800
Where you did DSC number 200 last year

1257
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,800
Wondering if you're going again

1258
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,800
I'm going to be there

1259
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,800
And Chris Burrell asked me to write a theme song for it

1260
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,800
So I'm working on that

1261
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,800
And he's got a thing on his website

1262
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,800
asking people to phone in and leave comments

1263
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,800
That we're going to mash up into the song

1264
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,800
So if you want to do one, you're welcome to do that

1265
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,800
That'd be fabulous

1266
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,800
And the next thing is the promo which is my wife

1267
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,800
And her friend are starting their first podcast

1268
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,800
It's called Lip Gloss and Laptops

1269
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,800
For the thinking woman they say

1270
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,800
So if you want to play it, it's coming right up

1271
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,800
Then you can segue right into a mental sexual moment

1272
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,800
If you want it, it'll all work

1273
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,800
Just give it a shot

1274
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,800
Here we go

1275
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,800
Hi, I'm Eric Dree

1276
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,800
And I know the difference between a lip smacker

1277
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,800
And a local area network

1278
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,800
And I know my way around a juicy tip and a JPEG file

1279
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,800
On March 1st, Lip Gloss and Laptops

1280
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,800
A beauty and cosmetics podcast for the thinking woman premieres

1281
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,800
Each week we will bring you thoughtful discussion

1282
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,800
Of modern beauty culture

1283
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,800
And controversies

1284
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,800
Lip College in anyone

1285
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,800
We will also bring you reviews of the hottest new beauty products

1286
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,800
Let us try before you buy five thousand times larger

1287
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,800
Do you really want your lashes that thick

1288
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,800
So go on to lipgloss and Laptops.com

1289
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,800
And tell us what your favorite lip gloss is

1290
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,800
And subscribe to our new podcast

1291
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,800
Speaking of which, do you remember the avon fun burger

1292
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,800
Popular in the 1970s?

1293
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,800
I remember the avon chocolate chip cookie

1294
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,800
But we're going to be talking about lip gloss in our first podcast

1295
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,800
Excellent

1296
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,800
Alright

1297
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,800
Women with lipstick who know about laptops

1298
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,800
Coming soon

1299
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,800
Dude, don't tell me how to put the show together

1300
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,800
That's not perfect for the metro sexual moment

1301
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,800
It's something completely different

1302
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,800
But I do love that idea

1303
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,800
Oh man, I've been waiting

1304
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,800
This is kind of like

1305
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,800
What is that website?

1306
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,800
Daily candy

1307
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,800
That was that Bob Pittman's site that he put together

1308
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,800
It just sold it for like $100 million

1309
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,800
Or something

1310
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,800
Oh, what an incredible audience there is out there

1311
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,800
For something like this

1312
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,800
I would love to talk about having this show

1313
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:28,800
As a part of our network

1314
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,800
I think I have a sponsor for it already

1315
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,800
So if you're interested, let me know

1316
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,800
Speaking of such

1317
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,800
As it comes into business models of podcasting

1318
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,800
Big news rocking the pod atmosphere

1319
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,800
Ricky Jervais

1320
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,800
The Ricky Jervais show

1321
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,800
Which of course is now in the

1322
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,800
Guinness Book of World Records

1323
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,800
As the most downloaded podcast ever

1324
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,800
Which I'm sure they'll have to change that

1325
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,800
Sometime around

1326
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,800
Oh next year when they do the next

1327
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,800
Guinness Book of World Records

1328
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,800
Had been making

1329
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,800
What city they did 12 episodes

1330
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,800
For free

1331
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,800
Available through the Guardian

1332
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,800
Which I thought was a great combination

1333
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,800
A great team up between the Guardian

1334
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,800
The UK newspaper the Guardian

1335
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,800
Who I guess were

1336
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,800
We're dealing with all the business side of it

1337
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,800
So they announced today

1338
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,800
Or actually on their 12th show

1339
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,800
But I guess the news now is official

1340
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,800
That the next series

1341
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,800
Season 2 as they're calling it

1342
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,800
Will be available exclusively

1343
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,800
Through audible

1344
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,800
And that will be done through iTunes

1345
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,800
Of course audible is the exclusive

1346
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,800
Provider of iTunes

1347
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,800
So actually I guess it'll be available

1348
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,800
Through the iTunes music store

1349
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,800
As well as through audible if you remember

1350
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,800
They're very interesting

1351
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,800
I think the first four episodes

1352
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,800
We'll cost you about six

1353
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,800
Dollars and they're just basically

1354
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,800
Changing from the free model

1355
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,800
I don't think they didn't have any ads in there

1356
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,800
I don't think other than for the Guardian

1357
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,800
I haven't heard every single show

1358
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,800
So I may be wrong

1359
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,800
But it doesn't matter

1360
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,800
Because

1361
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,800
Essentially they're going to a subscription-based model

1362
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,800
A four-pay model

1363
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,800
Which of course I presume would be without commercials

1364
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,800
And I cannot wait to see how this goes

1365
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,800
I'm very very curious

1366
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,800
Because here's something that

1367
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,800
Arguably but I think pretty much without doubt

1368
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,800
Is definitely one of the most downloaded podcasts

1369
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,800
Amy you got to believe the Guinness World Book of Records

1370
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,800
Right?

1371
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,800
If that indeed works

1372
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,800
And they have what are they claiming

1373
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,800
Like

1374
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,800
250 download

1375
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,800
No I think it was

1376
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,800
And with someone you're two million downloads a month

1377
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,800
That would of course

1378
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,800
If you're spending 50 cents or a buck

1379
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,800
Or I guess it's more than a buck

1380
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,800
It's what it's 125

1381
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,800
And you're aggregating that on the other end

1382
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,800
That's a pretty nice chunk of change

1383
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,800
The only thing that I'm not too sure about

1384
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,800
Though is if there will actually be

1385
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,800
Still be available as a subscription

1386
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,800
The way we know it in podcasting

1387
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,800
Because when you sign

1388
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,800
I guess their audible does have this

1389
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,800
But it wasn't very clear

1390
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,800
You sign up what I want to do

1391
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,800
Of course I want to subscribe

1392
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,800
And have these things show up automatically

1393
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,800
In this case it would have to be iTunes

1394
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,800
Because that's basically what

1395
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,800
What you can play back on

1396
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,800
Because it won't be the free and clear MP3s

1397
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,800
But we'll still come through automatically

1398
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,800
If anyone has signed up let me know

1399
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,800
My audible subscription has been

1400
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,800
My audible subscription has expired

1401
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,800
And I couldn't find it on iTunes yet

1402
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,800
But it's a just you know

1403
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,800
Is it like the video stuff where you click it

1404
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,800
And then it downloads and then you've got it

1405
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,800
Or can you set it up?

1406
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,800
So every single time this new show

1407
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,800
It comes in

1408
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,800
Good luck to them though

1409
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,800
And I hope that they continue to report back on how that's going

1410
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,800
Because that's very very exciting

1411
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,800
People who have content

1412
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,800
They think that other people will pay for

1413
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,800
Actually go out and do it

1414
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,800
For email from Chris

1415
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,800
Snethon

1416
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,800
Adam until this week and I hadn't listened to the Charlie since before

1417
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,800
Christmas it wasn't until today for example

1418
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,800
That I know it's now the Charlie

1419
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,800
Instead of the Chuck which is the next logical step

1420
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,800
Now I don't think we're going to go to the Chuck

1421
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,800
Anyway, I checked out DSC338337335 in that order

1422
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,800
And I have to say I'm sorry I left for so long

1423
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,800
It's stimulating for me and gets me thinking about possibilities

1424
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,800
Rather than just existing in my cubicle drone haze

1425
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,800
One thing really struck me listening to the show

1426
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,800
Not was the number of folks

1427
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,800
Bitching about this aspect of this aspect

1428
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,800
Of DSC or that aspect

1429
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,800
People were variously griping about the Metro sexual stuff

1430
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,800
Which I love he says

1431
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,800
The Earthling ads

1432
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,800
Minor compared to what they could be

1433
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,800
And the sound advertising which is interesting to me

1434
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,800
Heck, I even had a bitch back in December

1435
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,800
Which drove me away for those eight weeks or so

1436
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,800
Which was too many people kissing your ass

1437
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,800
Not that I didn't try myself

1438
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,800
But a couple of the bits go way out of hand

1439
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,800
But I figured that

1440
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,800
I figured out my iPod can fast forward through this stuff

1441
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,800
I don't care to hear and I still get what I want

1442
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,800
Oh really that's what those arrows are for

1443
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,800
I guess the point is I'm back

1444
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,800
I'd forgotten until today how much I got out of the show

1445
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,800
Keep up the great work and just remember that people are only griping

1446
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,800
Because they care if that makes any sense

1447
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,800
Of course they do

1448
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,800
Next time you're in Portland, Aurora, blah, blah, blah

1449
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,800
Yeah, you better believe it man

1450
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,800
I will be coming to Portland, Aurora when I do my instrument rating

1451
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,800
Which one of these days I'll get around to doing

1452
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,800
Okay, just briefly before we wind it up with a pretty funny song

1453
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,800
That's someone that sent me

1454
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,800
Stuff going on at the office

1455
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,800
Yes, they had a great hang with the K2

1456
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,800
He's Kevin ready

1457
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,800
New guy to the office

1458
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,800
It's amazing how many people speak Dutch

1459
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,800
You know, he's lived in the Netherlands for

1460
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,800
Often on probably about a year or so

1461
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,800
And he just picks up languages really easily

1462
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,800
I'm sure it has something to do with

1463
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,800
With his developer developer noggin there

1464
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,800
But we had a really good hang in South Park

1465
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,800
Yesterday if you know what I mean

1466
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,800
And just caught up on stuff and I'm really excited

1467
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,800
And just another guy that I'm so excited about working with

1468
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,800
We have so many people doing so many cool things in the office

1469
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,800
Hooked up with Andrew Grummet who was

1470
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,800
Completing D-Gap

1471
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,800
Oh man, this thing is just mind boggling

1472
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,800
You imagine, check this out

1473
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,800
So imagine you could record your podcast

1474
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,800
And then after you're done

1475
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,800
You could record any number of slots of different stuff

1476
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,800
So you say and you can program that

1477
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,800
So maybe after the fact you want to record the opening

1478
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,800
Because now you know what you did in your show

1479
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,800
And then that opening

1480
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,800
You could schedule it to be married automatically

1481
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,800
To the opening of your show

1482
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,800
So where I say you know what is it

1483
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,800
Delta share of Charlie 339

1484
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,800
I could actually do that later and say

1485
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,800
Delta share Charlie 339

1486
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,800
Chris is back stay tuned for it

1487
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,800
Whatever boom and it could start immediately

1488
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,800
Or I could schedule a promo

1489
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,800
It's just mind boggling the stuff that we're going to be able to do

1490
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,800
And I think that I saw on the board

1491
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,800
Some stuff is going to start

1492
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,800
Well some stuff is already starting to happen

1493
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,800
If you look at the podcast music network

1494
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,800
But we've got a player that is coming along with that

1495
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,800
I'd say somewhere around

1496
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:52,800
Sixth of March is when we'll really have a lot of stuff out there

1497
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,800
I think we're going to open up

1498
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,800
For a couple hundred people to come in

1499
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,800
And start using

1500
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,800
Not just the podcast delivery network

1501
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,800
But also the listener interface

1502
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,800
Where you can register as a listener of a podcast

1503
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,800
And it's just

1504
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,800
Hey, I love it

1505
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,800
There's so many good things happening

1506
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,800
All right, let's see what we got

1507
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,800
Oh man, 56 is going to be a full hour show today

1508
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,800
Russell sent me an email

1509
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,800
Adam looking for songs from my astronomy podcast

1510
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:21,800
Which is astronomy.podcastformat.com

1511
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,800
If I'm one that is not quite appropriate for my show

1512
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,800
But I figured it would go very nicely on the Charlie

1513
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,800
It's by Deirdre Flint and it's called the boob ferry

1514
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,800
When I was in my teenage years

1515
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,800
I did just what I should

1516
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:48,800
I listened to my mother and I was kind and sweet and good

1517
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,800
And my friends and I did rituals

1518
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,800
And I prayed with all my might

1519
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,800
That this would be the evening

1520
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:59,800
That she'd stop along her flight

1521
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,800
Well that was several years ago

1522
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,800
And that chick's long overdue

1523
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:10,800
And it's time I came to terms with something plainly clear to you

1524
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,800
The boob ferry never came for me

1525
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:20,800
No the boob ferry never came for me

1526
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,800
Okay, I'm spunky and I'm cute

1527
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,800
And I've got a great personality

1528
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,800
The boob ferry never came for me

1529
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,800
Well we were the third house on a country drive

1530
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,800
I thought maybe she just got lost

1531
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,800
So I hung my bra on the mailbox

1532
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,800
To the neighbors took it out

1533
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,800
And all my friends got visits

1534
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,800
And expanded through the years

1535
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,800
And left me whaling to the gods by training

1536
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,800
Bross and Sears

1537
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,800
Still I harbor hopes she'll come for me

1538
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,800
I know she will

1539
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,800
I get them done myself

1540
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,800
If she'd agreed to foot the bill

1541
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,800
The boob ferry never came for me

1542
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,800
No the boob ferry never came for me

1543
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,800
Look I wasn't wanting melons

1544
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,800
Just a cute, curfaceous bee

1545
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:24,800
But the boob ferry never came for me

1546
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,800
This isn't a song about boob's

1547
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,800
Not really

1548
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,800
The boob's are just a set of metaphors

1549
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,800
To symbolize everyone's fear of human anatomy

1550
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,800
Hey, we've all found the pain of being dissed

1551
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,800
By one ferry or another

1552
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,800
So during the next refrain I want you to join in with me

1553
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,800
With your own ferry that never paid a call

1554
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,800
Maybe it's the height ferry or the buttons

1555
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,800
And maybe it's the pectoral or hair ferry

1556
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,800
Or maybe some other ferry you just want to mumble about

1557
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,800
Look nobody's going to ask you to announce the A

1558
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,800
And sisters, I don't want you feeling alienated right now

1559
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,800
Because you happen to be full figured

1560
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,800
Just change the line to the boob ferry

1561
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:07,800
Just wouldn't let me be or the boob ferry became obsessed with me

1562
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,800
Okay, here comes the refrain

1563
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,800
Everybody, join in

1564
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:15,800
The boob ferry never came for me

1565
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:20,800
No, the boob ferry never came for me

1566
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:25,800
Though the hip ferry came two times

1567
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:31,800
And the five ferry came three

1568
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:36,800
The boob ferry never came for me

1569
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:40,800
That boob ferry never came for me

1570
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,800
So what ferry do you pray to?

1571
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,800
Very cool, the boob ferry

1572
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,800
You can find that a music dot pod show dot com

1573
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,800
That wraps it up for today

1574
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,800
We've got the rest of the week to go

1575
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,800
Lots of exciting stuff here in San Francisco

1576
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,800
Making it just about a full hour for the Charlie for today
