Episode number 515 thanks to Andrew Grummit for the for the opening of today's show almost like let me at some wrong

23
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,840
Yeah, oh my goodness

24
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,960
Well, yeah, there's something wrong with the cable

25
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,320
Andrew Grummit put together the who's 515

26
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,200
At in case it wasn't completely clear what's going on there

27
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,800
I'm back at the cottage. It's a shitty outside man. It's cold, you know for as

28
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:04,320
As dark and and dank as San Francisco was it wasn't this cold and we've got the real true London fog today

29
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Just rolling throughout the city

30
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:15,040
If I look out the window I can probably see about I'd say about 500 feet it's the entire distance I can see it's just one of those

31
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:23,280
Yeah, one of those pre-Christmas days in the United Kingdom good to be back arrived yesterday after you know

32
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,360
My typical 10 hour flight from San Francisco pretty un-eventful

33
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,360
I was completely prepared to not have any new movies on the in flight entertainment system

34
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,480
They pretty good about changing it every single month

35
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,200
I guess for some reason the month of December is not the month to change so I'd seen just about everything

36
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,200
So I'd purchased a couple of books including the

37
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,840
Let me just pick it up here for a second call

38
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,920
I

39
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,560
Want to get the title exactly right the Iraq study group report which I've seen a lot of TV host hold up on television

40
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And I wonder if they actually read it

41
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,320
So I took a stab and it wasn't all that hard to get through you know

42
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,320
I'll talk about that a little bit later on in the show

43
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,840
Because there's a lot to go through

44
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,720
First thing that's real bummer is all of a sudden for some reason

45
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,640
My Nokia the the E61 that I purchased it won't send any text messages so for some reason

46
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:26,480
You know, this is in in Europe we called SMS for short message service in the states

47
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:34,160
We call it text and it I can receive I can make calls. I can access the internet through the data connection

48
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,520
But for the life of me I can't send a text message and it happened the minute I landed I turned it on and

49
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,440
And

50
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,480
And I and I received stuff but I wasn't able can you I always sent Patricia little message when I land saying you know landed safely

51
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,360
What ever airport? I've landed at that point in time and

52
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,520
Then we'll go out and I get some kind of error message saying unable to send message

53
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,680
The error code is four five five zero and of course

54
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,240
Singular support has no idea

55
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,680
No one can figure it out well it could be the the you're roaming on team mobile UK and that could be a problem so and it just I feel incomplete

56
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,520
I feel really incomplete when I can't send the text messages. It's bothersome particularly with Patricia gone

57
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,640
You know because we text each other all the time it's like a baby how you doing and love you

58
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,200
But you know the stuff you do as well everyone does that right and

59
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
Of course she had her second

60
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,680
taping last night of dancing dancing with the stars and she did very well

61
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,400
I'm under complete embargo. I'm not allowed to tell you how everything went because the shows aren't being broadcast until

62
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,280
Was it I think Christmas

63
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,200
Now the day after Christmas is the first show and then the 31st of December is the second show

64
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,800
So I'm because there's points involved and all the even though it doesn't matter because it's all for charity

65
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:55,040
I'm not allowed to tell you but she was very excited and she had a great time and I know why man because just imagine

66
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,720
Like a little over two years ago. She was in the intensive care unit

67
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,360
You know near heart attack and now two and a half years later she's dancing full-scale competition doing the

68
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
Samba

69
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,960
I can't well hopefully now. I'm gonna force her to be on the show tomorrow. She's got to tell us how it went

70
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So I am

71
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Of course going through the mail when you come back after you're like two weeks of being away

72
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
There's a fine stack of stuff

73
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,840
Just lovely little messages from people around the world saying I want my money. Yes, it's built time

74
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,440
But there was also a package and I was really really impressed with this now

75
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,520
You know that I've told you that Virgin Airlines is really sucking up to their top to your customers and and

76
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,320
I just want to give you an example of that of what what it really makes me feel good by the way

77
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,880
So it is absolutely working because I have a choice. I can fly American. I could fly British. I could fly

78
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,480
Virgin obviously there's so many different airlines. I could choose to fly

79
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,040
So I got a

80
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,040
package from the CEO of

81
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,640
Virgin

82
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,640
Where's the note here it is

83
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
ah

84
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,240
Adam here's the only hand luggage you'll need in 2007 happy holidays

85
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,520
From CEO Steve Ridgeway and what they gave me

86
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,240
It's really nice. It's an iPod Nano and it's one of the one of the red ones so that's

87
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Bono and

88
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,520
And Tim Shriver's product red. I met him

89
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,520
Tim Shriver and met him Saturday night. I got talk. I got so much to tell you

90
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,520
It's what is it four gig one thousand songs so um, but it says on the card here

91
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,320
To retrieve Steve's message from your iPod

92
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,640
Follow these four easy steps. Well, I'm not gonna follow no steps. I want to hear the message so

93
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,520
Hold on a second. Let me just open this up. Let me let's listen to this together and see if they had put a person

94
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,480
I mean the my name on the card here Adam is in a different font and different color

95
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,600
The cards are definitely computer generated

96
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,080
Let's see if they were able to computer God. What do you need like a fucking blow torch to open this thing

97
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,120
How does this work? Oh, I see okay sticker here. Oh, that's actually better than the blow torch

98
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,080
I've never I've never purchased a nano. That's nice cute

99
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,000
Very cute. Okay. Oh, I'll tell you what here's we're gonna do

100
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
God this thing is so small

101
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,720
Let's uh, well, let's plug it in to the mixer here

102
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,520
I think we can do that. Here we go

103
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Yes, it's plugged in

104
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Okay, let's see

105
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Music photos

106
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Which we look under oh

107
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
What's this interesting

108
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,240
You're pre oh this is how do they do this? I've heard about companies doing this and working with Apple on that. This is great

109
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,840
They automatically subscribe me to the virgin Atlantic podcast feed which has

110
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Well

111
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,480
Looks like all these are all these guides to different to how so that's guide to Sydney

112
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,160
What's this Atlantic off beat London? Okay, so they put a podcast in there. That's pretty cool

113
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:09,280
Where's my message from Steve? Is that his name Steve? Wait, I forgot. Yeah, Steve Ridgeway

114
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't see it

115
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Okay

116
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,720
So this could be potentially very disobeyed. Oh, here it is Steve Ridgeway

117
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,520
CEO message. All right, let's go

118
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,960
Season's greeting to you from everyone at Virgin Atlantic. Okay. I can't think okay. I can't think

119
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,200
Season's greetings Adam all right, let's try it again

120
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,240
Season's greeting Adam from everyone at Virgin Atlantic

121
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,760
I can't thank you enough for all the support you've given us yet again in the past year

122
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,520
It's been an exciting time for us. We've opened new routes to Dubai

123
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,320
Which was a major breakthrough and of course our holiday program is expanded with the new route to Jamaica

124
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,880
We've carried on bringing our new aircraft so there's an even bigger fleet of A34600s

125
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,600
Which keeps us right up there with our pledge to operate one of the world's youngest fleet

126
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,000
upper class suite has continued to lead the pack as far as

127
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,800
Business classes concerned and we're very proud that we still have the most beautiful cabin and the biggest and best bed that's out there flying

128
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,600
You know, they could have done a little better job on the recording

129
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,680
I mean what they do they they just went into his office and it's a hung a mic from the chandelier

130
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,680
That sounds like crap, but we are not resting on our laurels more to come next year

131
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,640
I'm sure you'll be pleased to hear that Chicago is back on the list

132
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,440
The next year we sadly came out of the Chicago market after September 11th

133
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,000
But it's great to be going back in we're going to give our competitors a great run for their money as usual

134
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,000
And I hope we can see you on our Chicago flight if you want to be a relaxation

135
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,280
Then there's a new program in the Indian Ocean with Mauritius starting at the end of next year and certainly everyone here

136
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,480
at Atlantic tickly on the leisure side is really excited about that

137
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,160
So enjoy playing with your iPod and downloading all the music commute should be a great companion for your trips

138
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,960
But of course you can watch many many films when you're flying next and once again as I said at the beginning

139
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,840
Really appreciate all the support you give us we couldn't do it without you and and I look forward to seeing you all again next year

140
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Season's greetings yes

141
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,560

There are podcasts guides to other went to the podcast. Yes

143
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,200

144
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Steve. Thank you

145
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,440
Okay, let me plug that back in there. Okay. Well, that was nice

146
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
That's that's customer service man

147
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,080
That's what an all about

148
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,080
Hello, Adam this is Stella from Brisbane California

149
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,680
I just talked through listening to Hoover Friday and I just thought

150
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,600
I'd make a suggestion as regards your show about flying

151
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:48,000
Let's lean the fool's because it sounds good flying fool sounds really good that how about soaring fool

152
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,080
And it just makes me think of birds that soar so high and that's what planes do

153
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,040
So soaringfools.com

154
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Well, have

155
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Great

156
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
Thanks, darling

157
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,120
I don't think so. I mean don't you understand that flying fools feels better than soaring fools

158
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,520
Soaring now. No, no, no, no flying fools. I'm gonna keep it at that

159
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,200
But I played your voice moments because it's always nice to hear a woman calling on the voice

160
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
I don't get enough of

161
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,040
Six three

162
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,960
Yeah, that's the number if you're calling us from the United States and of course if you're in the UK you can use this number

163
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
753

164
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
I don't know if Google is just improving stuff

165
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,800
Cuz I keep seeing new features pop up on now. I use the docks and spreadsheets and we use the collaboration

166
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,480
Feature all the time within pod show by the way. That's great. I mean real

167
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,720
Financial models and in spreadsheets. It's way too slow too cumbersome and not everything translates and

168
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,280
You know we have a lot of very complex

169
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,480
Financial models that we've built into or I built in Excel because you know

170
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,720
We have thousands of people that we pay on a on a by monthly basis twice a month

171
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,760
That by monthly by weekly whenever twice a month

172
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,160
And that just doesn't really work or it's too slow or just anyway. I use

173
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,760
Google's calendar

174
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
religiously I love it

175
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
Of course I use Gmail

176
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,280
I'm such a

177
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,120
Google fanboy when it comes to that and I'm being using notebook and it it appears that

178
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,040
This Google notebook which is it's kind of meant to you know to be able to

179
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,720
It's more like a clipboard for the web so you see something

180
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,200
A page you like or an email message and it's pretty smart about knowing that something's an email message

181
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,880
And it'll copy the entire message and it will automatically provide the link and it's just a whole bunch of things that are smart

182
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,320
Except for one thing and I've talked about this a couple times when you click on the link when you're in

183
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,440
Google notebook it doesn't open up a new window or a new tab

184
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,840
It goes to the link and you know, therefore you have to

185
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:34,000
Backspace or hit the back button to get back into notepad and that takes a long time to load

186
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,840
Because of course I have lots of shit in my notepad

187
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,120
I'm using it like an outline right use it for all kinds of stuff and I'm seeing that

188
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,840
You know, I'm just

189
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,520
Maybe I'm just learning the the I'll call it an application even though it's not

190
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,920
I'm figuring out how to use it in a very efficient manner almost like a full blown outline or so I'm really happy with it

191
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
But I still can't figure out how to get

192
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
A link to pop open in a new window

193
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:02,240
Obviously, I can you know hit right you know, I can hit the right mouse button and say open a new tab and all that

194
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,080
But I wanted to react like all the Google apps because that's what I'm used to and I keep making them steak

195
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,200
Oh, it's

196
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,520
Just say hey Jamie Ross sent me an email

197
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,360
That would be

198
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,840
Our new our new executive assistant Jamie Ross you said Adam if you'd like Google to open a new tab click on preferences on the Google main page

199
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
Yeah, I did that

200
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:34,240
But it doesn't work for notebook Jamie as nice, but it's funny in that because I like didn't even know that was Jamie from our office

201
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,120
I just I just saw Jay Ross like a Jay Ross sent me some

202
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,360
Hey portions of today's show are brought to you by brand new movie

203
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,320
Which opens up hold on let me get all the details here

204
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,280
Uh

205
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:56,160
The movie is called Stomp the Yard and it opens up January 12 now. This is from the same theater the same

206
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
Movie company

207
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:07,760
Who wanted us to promote a little man and you remember that that was a very successful movie and I love doing the

208
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,600
I've really loved doing the the promotions for it because I hadn't seen it and they weren't gonna give me a DVD

209
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
It's the same with this one. I have no idea

210
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,320
However, I do know that we have a podcast all about Stomp the Yard

211
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,760
Which I think it's gonna be a really good movie and

212
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,800
It just you know, it could be one of these things that's at the beginning of January

213
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,240
You know, we're ready for some

214
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
Light entertainment yet

215
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,920
You know some serious message it's a new year everyone's in the new year's resolution. I think the timing is really good

216
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
of this movie. It's about

217
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,040
A troubled youth from Los Angeles attending the historically black truth university in Atlanta, Georgia and

218
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,480
What adapting to his new environment proves difficult

219
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:01,120
He finds solace in joining a struggling fraternity where he begins implementing his street style dance moves and attempt to help the step team

220
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,680
When the coveted national step show championship

221
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,120
So there's you know, there's some inspiration in there and and and it kind of hits home

222
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,160
Particularly the first episode because Stomp the podcast.com is where you can hear all about the movie

223
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,120
Tony cost of cost as world is is producing that nice guy by the way

224
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,800
I had a chance to meet him both in Los Angeles and up in San Francisco for our holiday party

225
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,840
On the first episode which came out on I think Friday at

226
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
Stompthepodcast.com

227
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,840
Tony has a can of conversation on black college life black Greek organizations and the impact that has on the culture

228
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,440
And of course cost as world a show itself also highlight

229
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,840
The upcoming movie Stomp the yard a couple other podcasts joining in this as well and I really want to see this movie

230
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:58,480
Oh, oh, shit. No, it didn't happen. Oh, sorry. I want to see this movie because when I was in college for all four months that I was in college

231
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
In West Virginia I

232
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,240
Pledge Kappa

233
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,880
Now you have to know that my roommate tie Hamilton at the time this was 1980

234
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,320
Was at 80 crap 81

235
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,320
1980 81

236
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
You know

237
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,440
We would have said of each other. Oh, you know my roommate is black and he would have said my roommate is white

238
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,240
These days of course we have to speak of African American and Caucasian and be very politically correct

239
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,240
But it was about if it was a mixed school about 50 50 50 tie was from

240
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,680
Trenton New Jersey and

241
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,000
You know he became buddies and and I didn't really have any friends no one

242
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,440
That I knew went to that school and of course he had a lot of people that he knew and

243
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,160
And start hanging out and we were into the same music because I came from Amsterdam at the time

244
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:52,800
It was literally the same music that that urban America was listening to so we got along famously through the bridge of music

245
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,160
I would say

246
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,880
Most importantly and I hung out you know and then and then and then said hey you should pledge Kappa

247
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,920
Which meant I didn't know it at the time when I said oh, yeah sure

248
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,080
Sure I'll do that and meant carrying around a fucking brick a couple weeks

249
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,400
But it was quite an experience and so I can't wait to see this movie should be very interesting

250
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,040
People write me here as a man of the people of the world

251
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,640
And nothing is as well

252
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,080
So this is the it cuts off there unfortunately. That's the prolific programmer from San Francisco

253
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,040
He's called the voicemail lines a number of times but it's been

254
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,960
Reasonly unintelligible what he was saying or it was like so it was such a long story

255
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,960
So the point here was that he appreciated me talking about to engineers on Friday's final thought of the week

256
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,920
Yeah, man

257
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,880
We love engineers. That's why I stood still for a moment to think about them

258
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,400
Okay, back to the how are we doing on time me? Wow talking a lot of shit here today

259
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,080
I see Brian and Nigma sense a whole thing about the

260
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,480
I incorrectly said DMTF tones you know the tones that I was playing so you can automatically dial your phone

261
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,520
It's actually DTMF dual tone multi frequency

262
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
He's got a whole

263
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,760
A whole history of where they come from

264
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,440
See the whole system was designed so that

265
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,440
Computers if yesterday or could understand what button you were pressing without direct being directly wired to the button

266
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,760
And you couldn't accidentally make the sound of a button press. Oh, I'm sure people can do that

267
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,280
I'm sure that there are people out there who can make those sounds. Where's my uh

268
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,680
I have a little uh a little thing

269
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,560
Hmm

270
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,560
Not gonna have to go into my computer

271
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,520
I'll be worth it for a second hold on let me see local disc

272
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,560
This is the thing that's much easier on the Mac just to get you just go to applications and you're there and here I have to

273
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,280
Search through a million different folders. Here it is

274
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,920
What is this tone dialer? There you go. So the tones we're talking about are these

275
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
I bet you there people out there who can make that noise

276
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,160
Okay

277
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,880
Try it record something send it to me

278
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,680
I'll see if I can make a dial and make it a surprise make it something cool that we're gonna dial

279
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,120
You know where to send it add them at podshow.com

280
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,760
Radion records interesting article PD love from love house radio sent me that

281
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,240
Oh shit I clicked on the link without opening a new tab

282
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,000
So radion records is pretty much the Bible for for the radio business and

283
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
They came to an amazing conclusion

284
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,520
It's the content providing compiling content wins

285
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,880
Says critical mass media is caroling Gilbert. Do you know there's one of the thousands of consultants

286
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,400
Devoting the energy to finding out what they want and delivering it is the future of radio she asserted

287
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
Yeah duh

288
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:20,480
So they go on to talk about you know the new formats the jack format which I'm sure you've heard and then there's the move in format

289
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,120
It has a fresh success and Seattle a thing that really got me here at the end so this was

290
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,880
There was some panel. Where was this panel as a panel of marketing marks in in the radio business

291
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,400
They underscore the importance of broadcasters using overnight to groom talent for the future and to

292
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,240
Prime the audience well by spending more of a station's budget on marketing and promotions

293
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,720
Well most in attendance seem to gravitate to the latter notion if you wondered where in these days of severe budget cuts that funding would come from

294
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,280
That's right your fucking host

295
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,120
Not that I feel good about it. You're welcome over here all of just

296
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,440
All of just come on over to the dark side. That's plenty to do

297
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,280
And got some great things we're gonna be talking about in the new year

298
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,480
Not the least of which is the toddies

299
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:16,480
Jersey Todd show is handing out awards. I was I don't know if I'm if I've been invited to present an award or not

300
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:23,680
I was so busy. I couldn't make a part of my commitments to the toddies and I think I've been scrapped off the list

301
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,680
But check out Jersey Todd show

302
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,680

Well, we are getting very near the day

307
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,920

309
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,960

What fun it is to ride and sing

318
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:56,760
A singing song tonight

319
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,760
Just go to your day

320
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,760
Or what fun it is to ride and sing

321
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,760
A singing song tonight

322
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,760
To go back to your past

323
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,760
She will only

324
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,760
What fun it is to ride

325
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,760
Or the fields we go

326
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:23,760
Dancing through the snow

327
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,760
Wanting a song

328
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
She will be

329
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,760
Under way you sing

330
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,760
To go back to your past

331
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,760
She will be

332
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,760
What fun it is to ride and sing

333
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,760
A singing song tonight

334
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,760
For fun it is to ride and sing

335
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,760
A singing song

336
00:27:48,760 --> 00:28:18,760
Oh there's Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells

337
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:48,760
Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Jing

338
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,760
I had to listen this five times before I understood it.

339
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,760
I'm not even going to go into that.

340
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:05,760
So Sunday, just before I left, I picked up Pacific Coast Hellway,

341
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:12,760
which was a collaboration on the heavily promoted interview with Jesus

342
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,760
for his upcoming birthday.

343
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
I got a tell you.

344
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,760
I really liked it. It was very funny.

345
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
Now I can understand, I do want to be sensitive.

346
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,760
If you love Jesus, you may not like this whole idea.

347
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,760
But I think it's all, it's all in good humor.

348
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:35,760
It reminds me a lot of Mel Brooks interview with the 2000 year old man.

349
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,760
Some of you may be old enough to remember that.

350
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,760
I only remember because my parents happened to have that album hanging around the house.

351
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,760
So I'm sure it's from at least the early 60s, maybe than late 50s.

352
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,760
But just the whole idea reminded me of that very much.

353
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,760
I got a promo with a couple of clips from it.

354
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,760
This is Brian from audio attitude inviting you to listen to the Jesus interview.

355
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,760
We talked about a lot of things, including what he was like as a kid.

356
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,760
Yeah, I was a dick, really.

357
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,760
What do you think of meetings?

358
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,760
Year 300 AD.

359
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
Minutes from the meeting.

360
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
Gabriel.

361
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Blah, blah, blah.

362
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,760
Same fucking thing every year.

363
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,760
What the H means in Jesus H Christ?

364
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,760
This is so embarrassing.

365
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,760
I mean, you don't have to tell us what the middle initial is.

366
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,760
My middle name is Hyman.

367
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
Okay.

368
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,760
And that's the problem.

369
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
Folder or a scruncher.

370
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
Oh, you know what?

371
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,760
Actually, here's the beauty of it.

372
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,760
Every time I take a shit.

373
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
Perfect.

374
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,760
I don't even have to wipe.

375
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,760
Just like, boom, I mean, that's it.

376
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
It's just like, it's a gift, man.

377
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
It's just like one of those things.

378
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,760
It's just like, I don't even have to really squeeze that hard.

379
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,760
I just kind of like, there's a little moment.

380
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,760
I take a little breath and go, and you know, drops in the ball.

381
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
And I'm done.

382
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,760
So clean as a whistle.

383
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,760
You know, sometimes I'll check.

384
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,760
But what does it smell like?

385
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,760
You know what?

386
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,760
It smells like.

387
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
Here's the funny thing.

388
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,760
It actually smells just a little bit.

389
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
Just a tiny bit.

390
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,760
You know what?

391
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
This is going to be weird.

392
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,760
This is a little too weird.

393
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,760
I don't know if I can talk about this.

394
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,760
No, that's okay.

395
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,760
I'm curious because, you know,

396
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,760
Okay, it smells just a little bit.

397
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,760
Like Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

398
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,760
I don't know.

399
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,760
It's kind of a little bit that old lady's smell

400
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,760
and a little bit of perfume.

401
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
But it's, I don't know.

402
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,760
I've never smelled Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

403
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,760
And, well, come over sometime after I've had, you know, tacos.

404
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,760
Here I come, Jesus.

405
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,760
Jesus interview.

406
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,760
Attitude.podshow.com.

407
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,760
Yeah, you should listen to it.

408
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,760
It's very funny.

409
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
Yeah.

410
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,760
I don't know how much of the, of the interview

411
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,760
the guys that scripted out.

412
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,760
Sometimes you can tell.

413
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
I just cracking up.

414
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,760
It's good.

415
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,760
Last week, I talked about the new John Cleese podcast.

416
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,760
It's not a new podcast, but it's first video,

417
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,760
it's first video podcast.

418
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,760
And while I was talking about that,

419
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
I mentioned the guy who, I don't know if he's producing it

420
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,760
or hosting and doing the RSS feeds

421
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,760
or maybe he's doing all the production.

422
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,760
Maybe he's writing it.

423
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,760
I don't know.

424
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,760
This guy named Dean Woodbread from the UK.

425
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,760
And I said he was a dick.

426
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,760
And this sparked off all kinds of controversy

427
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,760
in the UK amongst the UK,

428
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,760
the UK podcasters association.

429
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,760
And I just wanted to, you know,

430
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,760
it's like, oh, it's unbelievable.

431
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,760
How important people think this is.

432
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,760
So I wanted to elaborate a little bit on that.

433
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,760
First of all, about brick caster itself.

434
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,760
A brick caster is run by Neil,

435
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,760
or was run by Neil.

436
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,760
And he'd been running that way before I ever met him.

437
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,760
And when we started talking,

438
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,760
when podshow, when I said podshow is coming to the UK,

439
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
when we'd be doing things,

440
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,760
it was all of the speculation about,

441
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,760
you know, Neil, you built this just for,

442
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,760
for BT podshow, you're going to sell out.

443
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
And you know, all of this fucking like,

444
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,760
you know, it's a pruder type

445
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,760
conspiracy theories.

446
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,760
And you know, what of course happened is,

447
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,760
as I could have predicted,

448
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,760
which I didn't do,

449
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,760
because I thought it actually might be

450
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,760
a little bit different here in the UK

451
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,760
that there might be a more sense of

452
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,760
politeness and consideration.

453
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,760
But most online communities that don't have

454
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,760
a real community blow up,

455
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,760
that's just the way it works,

456
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,760
because everyone's on equal footing equal ground.

457
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,760
And I've seen it hundreds of times.

458
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,760
They just explode unless they're heavily moderated.

459
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
And then of course, you know,

460
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,760
really a community if there's some uber boss.

461
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,760
And the problem is that podcasting

462
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,760
cannot be a community,

463
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,760
because it's a, it's a verb.

464
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,760
You know, it's an action.

465
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,760
It's a thing you do.

466
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,760
And there is no right or wrong way.

467
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,760
It's, you know,

468
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,760
yes, there are conventions for broadcasters,

469
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,760
like the NAB,

470
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
NASA Association of Broadcasters,

471
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
and they come together,

472
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,760
and they have a conference.

473
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,760
You know, but it's not like they have a club

474
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,760
where they all hang out,

475
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,760
because there's so many different types of broadcasters.

476
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,760
There's broadcasters for profit broadcasters for non-profit.

477
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
There's Christian broadcasters,

478
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,760
there's music broadcasters,

479
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,760
there's talk broadcasters.

480
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,760
You know,

481
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,760
the only thing they have in common,

482
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,760
which is why they can actually call themselves

483
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,760
some form of a community,

484
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,760
is that they all have to deal with

485
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,760
restrictive distribution.

486
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,760
We don't have that with podcasting.

487
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,760
And podcasting can mean a million different things

488
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,760
to a million different people.

489
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,760
So what do you actually a community for?

490
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,760
You know,

491
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,760
what is there actually to talk about?

492
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,760
Other than,

493
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,760
hey man, I love your show.

494
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,760
Listen to my show.

495
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,760
Hey, you should subscribe to my show.

496
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Your show sucks, your show's great.

497
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,760
You know,

498
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,760
what's a show?

499
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,760
How do I do?

500
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,760
It's like, you know,

501
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,760
it just doesn't make any sense

502
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,760
to call it a community.

503
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,760
By the way,

504
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,760
communities in general,

505
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,760
I am,

506
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,760
I would call it more like clubs.

507
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,760
I don't join clubs.

508
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,760
I don't like clubs,

509
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,760
because usually,

510
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,760
you know, clubs are pretty much meant to be exclusive.

511
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,760
And even if they're completely open,

512
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,760
people come into the club and say something

513
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,760
and then it's like, well,

514
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,760
you don't talk that way here.

515
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
And so, you know,

516
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,760
immediately it's an exclusionary thing.

517
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,760
Samuel Johnson said in the 1700s,

518
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,760
there will always be a part

519
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,760
and always a very large part

520
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,760
of every community

521
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,760
that have no care about for themselves

522
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
and whose care for themselves

523
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
reaches little

524
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,760
and nothing,

525
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,760
if impatience of immediate pain

526
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,760
and eagerness for the nearest good.

527
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
And, and boy,

528
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,760
that really is true.

529
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,760
So anyway,

530
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,760
I knew this was going to blow up

531
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,760
and I didn't really follow

532
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,760
all the threads,

533
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,760
but from what I understand.

534
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,760
And he writes so much,

535
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,760
Dean Whitbread had a lot to do

536
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,760
with Neil and Jen just saying,

537
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,760
screw it.

538
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,760
We don't want to abuse anymore.

539
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,760
Just tired of it.

540
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,760
And,

541
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,760
so the reason why I called him a dick

542
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,760
and he still is a dick,

543
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,760
is he did something

544
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,760
that was really low-life move?

545
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,760
He posted,

546
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,760
I should probably look it up

547
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,760
so I don't miss quote him

548
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
because I'll be just as bad as he is.

549
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
I don't want to second watch it.

550
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,760
It was,

551
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,760
blogger.

552
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,760
Maybe there's blogger news.com.

553
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,760
Shit, I should have prepared this.

554
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,760
I'm sorry.

555
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,760
You know,

556
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,760
maybe I'll find you here.

557
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,760
You know,

558
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,760
which already kind of,

559
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,760
when you say,

560
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,760
when you post something on

561
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,760
blogger news,

562
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,760
crap,

563
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,760
I'm not finding it.

564
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
Let me see if I can,

565
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,760
oh,

566
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,760
Google,

567
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,760
help me out in my hour of need.

568
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,760
Blah,

569
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
okay,

570
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
here it is.

571
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,760
No, it's not blogger.

572
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,760
Shit.

573
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,760
Okay,

574
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
I can't find it.

575
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
I'll look for it.

576
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,760
Here's what he did.

577
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,760
Here's what I thought was low-life of him.

578
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,760
So he posted something

579
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,760
over at bloggernews.com,

580
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,760
whatever it is.

581
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,760
And the post said

582
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,760
that,

583
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,760
you know,

584
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,760
he had done some investigative work.

585
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,760
And it was very clear that pod show

586
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,760
its US operations were in trouble.

587
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
And a number of people jumped in

588
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,760
and said,

589
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,760
dude,

590
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,760
what are you talking about?

591
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,760
What are you base that on?

592
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,760
And he did the lowest low-life thing

593
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,760
that any so-called journalist can do.

594
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,760
He said,

595
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,760
oh, well,

596
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,760
you know,

597
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,760
first of all,

598
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,760
I have this first hand from people

599
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,760
who I'm not going to name.

600
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,760
Okay,

601
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,760
you don't have to name your sources.

602
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
He didn't actually,

603
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,760
wasn't actually able to say

604
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,760
what the problem was.

605
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,760
And then he said,

606
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,760
this is,

607
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,760
this really gets me.

608
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
If,

609
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,760
if none of its true,

610
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,760
why are you making such a big deal about it?

611
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,760
And that is exactly what gossip magazines do.

612
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
They'll say something,

613
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,760
which is completely untrue.

614
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,760
Regardless of whether it's true or not,

615
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,760
without any facts,

616
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,760
any backup,

617
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,760
any details.

618
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,760
And then when called upon it,

619
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,760
they'll say,

620
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,760
oh, excuse me,

621
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,760
you know,

622
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,760
if, if not of its true,

623
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
what are you making such a big deal about it?

624
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,760
Or as Dean would say,

625
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,760
what,

626
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,760
what,

627
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,760
what do you give a jot?

628
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,760
And when you do that,

629
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,760
you're deck.

630
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,760
It's plain and simple.

631
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,760
And that's all I had to say about it,

632
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,760
really.

633
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,760
All right,

634
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,760
one more song before I get out of here.

635
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,760
Again,

636
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
from the pod save music network,

637
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,760
high on the pod played this week,

638
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,760
Al Stravinsky's one Christmas

639
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
on your daily source code.

640
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,760
I'm just counting the days,

641
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,760
counting the days.

642
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,760
I like the Mary's Celeste,

643
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,760
well,

644
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,760
about the mystery.

645
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,760
Since you abandoned me,

646
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,760
I'm an object I've stuck with,

647
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,760
without the history.

648
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,760
Since you deserted me,

649
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,760
I'm the city of trial,

650
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,760
I've gained a stupid wall,

651
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,760
with one in horse,

652
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,760
but no hell and a cause,

653
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,760
but Christmas for seasons,

654
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,760
if they do some day favors,

655
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,760
if they step out times,

656
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,760
I turn to the rise,

657
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,760
and say goodnight to no one,

658
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,760
to no one,

659
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,760
to no one,

660
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,760
to no one who would take your love.

661
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,760
I've had a little weed got a sail,

662
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,760
but follow those own land,

663
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,760
and I'm too close to God,

664
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,760
So what? The world's getting hotter

665
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,760
I love to live by the sea

666
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,760
I'm not sure where, but it'll come to me

667
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,760
So be on hair creatures on earth

668
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,760
We'll be in the zoo

669
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,760
Well, I've got problem too

670
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,760
One Christmas for seasons

671
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,760
With the two Monday mornings

672
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,760
Respected by times I live with my head

673
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,760
All out of bed for nothing

674
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,760
For no one, for no reason

675
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:06,760
For nothing if I think you love me

676
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:12,760
So be on hair creatures on earth

677
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,760
All out of bed for nothing

678
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,760
For no one, for no reason

679
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:28,760
For nothing if I think you love me

680
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:33,760
So be on hair creatures on earth

681
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,760
I'm not sure where, but it'll come to me

682
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,760
One Christmas for Christmas

683
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,760
One Christmas for seasons

684
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,760
With the two Monday mornings

685
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,760
Respected by times I live with my head

686
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,760
All out of bed for nothing

687
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,760
For no one, for no one

688
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,760
For nothing if I think you love me

689
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,760
So be on hair creatures on earth

690
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,760
I'm not sure where, but it'll come to me

691
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,760
So be on hair creatures on earth

692
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,760
I'm not sure where, but it'll come to me

693
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,760
I'm just coming to me

694
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:37,760
So be on hair creatures on earth

695
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:53,760
I'm just coming to you

696
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,120
the blogger news network, and so we post about the Rick Haster form to close in the

697
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:04,560
15th of December. And here it is. Dixon, that would be Neil Dixon, cited reasons of having

698
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,880
insufficient time available to manage the forum. However, reports that all is not well in the

699
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,640
U.S. companies' operation continue to emerge. No link to any reports. With several notable

700
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,600
podcasts, there's having made an early exit. That's all presumptuous. Questions being raised

701
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:25,120
about expenditure rationale, questions where, show me a link, and low levels of revenue

702
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:30,640
share amongst pod show signies, a categorically not true if you look at the comments in the post.

703
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,640
Dixon has previously denied that pod show have put him under pressure to bring Brick Caster

704
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,520
into the expanding podcast empire. So you can kind of feel the crap that's in here. And then he

705
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:46,000
immediately hijacks the news to promote a new UK community podcast form called the National

706
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,240
Grid set up by the UK podcast association, which as far as I can tell is a bunch of lawyers who

707
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,680
want to pontificate about the world intellectual property organization. And some stupid rule they

708
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:04,560
thought that might actually happen. So that's just, that's not reporting. There's no, there's nothing

709
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,040
there. So it gets called on at several times in the comments. And here's what really may be

710
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:18,560
column a dick. No, but he has been falsely accusing anyone he writes. However, it is clear to see

711
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:25,040
that the UK community has effectively now been split along factional lines, which is drama queen.

712
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,120
It's quite reasonable to draw conclusions from the current situation. So this is what he's doing

713
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:36,320
is drawing conclusions and admitting it. This blog allows comments. Such comments are the tried and

714
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,720
tested way of challenging a blog post, veracity. And people are sitting there saying, hey, I'm

715
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,440
making money. I'm doing good. I don't know about any problems. So here comes. Why did the defense

716
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,720
extend into the mainly non-pod show new forum? Why the flames? If I am so far from the truth,

717
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,440
why the enormous fuss? So you know what? Fuck it. I'm upgrading this guy from dickhead to

718
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:01,440
ass hat. Okay. And it has nothing. Absolutely nothing to do with whether we work with him or not,

719
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,880
whether we work with John Clease or not. I mean, there's been so many conversations we had with

720
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,280
people. The stuff that didn't work out in the UK and the US. And there's no big deal. I don't talk

721
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,080
about it. I'll talk about one now just to give you an example. For those living in the UK,

722
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:20,960
there's a morning DJ called Bam Bam, who was on Virgin Radio. And he was fired,

723
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:26,320
a husband fired several times. He was fired before we actually started ramping up with B.T.

724
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:30,080
Pot show. He was fired from Virgin. And like, wow, this is perfect. We should see if we can get this

725
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:38,000
guy to do a show. And he was working on his own podcast, which was yet to pay for it. And so,

726
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,480
you know, we had several rounds of conversations with him and his partner slash agent manager.

727
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:51,040
And you know, it looked like it might be something. And then when it came down to compensation,

728
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,440
he was clearly looking for something that we were not willing to provide. He was looking for

729
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,360
I mean, we were offering a nice amount of money for him to come on board. But he wanted like a million

730
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:06,480
pounds a year, which is I'm sorry. You just not going to get that. I hope you enjoyed the coffee.

731
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,280
I guess it's about all you'll get from Pod Show. And that was okay, you know, and so I never

732
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:17,920
made any big fuss about him. And we parted our ways. And unfortunate. But, you know, no reason to

733
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:24,000
air out any laundry about that. And end of story. So it says nothing to do with that. This has to do

734
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:31,280
with a guy pretending to report on a story while he's hijacking a so-called community to come

735
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:37,440
over to his place. And not backing any of his claims up. And I'm quite frankly, I'm disappointed.

736
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,840
I'm disappointed with the with everyone who's participating in these forms. But, you know,

737
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:47,200
there's a club here. And the club is called the UK podcast. There's association. And they don't

738
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,160
like me. They pretend or they're civil about it. But when you really read into the boards and

739
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,360
you see what people are writing. Oh, man. So you guys should get over it. Really, really should.

740
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,040
Everyone's welcome to hang out. Have some fun. Do your own thing. Do whatever.

741
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,440
Just don't talk bullshit without being able to back it up. That's all I ask. What are we

742
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,800
adding? Now, 46 minutes. Damn it. I got to clean up the house. I got to go through the

743
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:16,560
checklist before Patricia comes home. I'll talk to y'all tomorrow. Adam at podshow.com daily source
