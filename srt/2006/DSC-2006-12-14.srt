Do not try to remain calm.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This show is going into motion.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That is the worst code number.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Five hundred and forty.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In a world where women wear comfortable shoes and nothing else.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's the daily source code episode five thirteen.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Sixty million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm on fire.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I could barely stand myself.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
In it doubts I had.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I left them on the show.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm on a mission.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Ain't nothing going to hold me back.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Tomorrow when you hear about what I did.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You've got to follow and have a heart attack.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I found the sweet baby as pretty as you want to be.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
By the end of the night.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
She's gonna be a means with me.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm around eleven thirty.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm stopping by her crib.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Tomorrow when I do get a story.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You won't believe the things I did.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm gonna show her my old face.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm gonna show her my old face.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm gonna show her my old face.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm gonna show her my old face.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Wow!

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I got my best slacks.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And my shirt's looking fly.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Ain't no way she gonna say no.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
With the way I look tonight.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm gonna love this.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I know she's gonna tell her friends.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But I get to a place I'll wait for right time.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's time to slip in some blind slid

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm gonna show her my old face

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm gonna show her my old face

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm gonna show her my old face

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm gonna show her my old face

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm gonna show her my old face

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:31,000
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It took me a little while to figure it out, but yeah, that's what he's singing.

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm going to show her my old face.

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
His name is Bo Halle, he's from Georgia.

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And he's got the most piercing blue eyes I've seen in a long, long time.

54
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
If Prince had a car wreck with the Rolling Stones and Stevie Ray Vaughn, the resulting candy bar would be called...

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
UNAs, Bo Halle's new city, which he calls the soundtrack for mating Toronto Sorrows.

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay.

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's on the pod save music networks where you can find it.

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Show notes.

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
We'll lead you there at DailySourceCode.com.

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

61
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's Thursday.

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It is episode 513 of the DailySourceCode coming to you once again from Northern California, from San Francisco, the Curry condo.

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So what is up with San Francisco?

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
San Francisco, what is up with you?

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's weather is shite.

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's been raining.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's like Seattle.

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It is literally like Seattle here.

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
As since we've had the company since I've had the condo, I don't think I've seen it this bad.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Maybe I just wasn't here.

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
This time Christmas last year, but nasty.

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Thursday.

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's early once again.

74
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I gotta tell you this is just about the time when I start feeling ready to go back home.

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
To be back on a...

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Just a different schedule.

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This early morning stuff is very difficult for me.

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And we've had so many logistical challenges.

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I didn't mention this for some very obvious reasons.

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But yesterday, Patricia left early in the morning.

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You know, that was the whole life I got my medicine thing.

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Which worked out fine, by the way.

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
She turned out she was only a half an hour later in the studio than if she'd taken her original flight.

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Go figure that.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But Christina was actually all alone in the house yesterday.

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
This was a big, big, big...

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Well, I don't want to call it a test.

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I want to call it a challenge.

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
When you leave your kid alone overnight, and of course the neighbors were very well aware of the situation.

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But neither I could be there nor Patricia and her grandparents arrived this afternoon.

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So, you know, I knew that she would be there full overnight all by herself.

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And it's really one of the most frightening things for her parent.

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Even though, you know, she's 16.

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
She can take care of herself.

95
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
She can certainly take care of herself out on the streets and in the city.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
At least I think so.

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
She seems to be staying on a trouble.

98
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But it was, you know, so anyway, so I stayed up extra late to call to make sure that she was up in the morning.

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You K-time, and you know, she was up and about and getting ready for school and everything was okay.

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And, you know, I just didn't really have a very restful night to be quite honest.

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It was like, oh, my baby.

102
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I know I'd promised you, well, promises a big word.

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I said that what I'd like to do today is I'd like to go through everything that Podshow is doing.

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And as I sat down this morning at 6.15 a.m.

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
To start writing it all down, I realized that that preparing even for an hour

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
would just not do anything justice.

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And so I really want to take some time to map everything out because we are doing an incredible amount of stuff.

108
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You know, we basically have four networks that we've now integrated into one.

109
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
If you look at the music flowing from the Podsate Music Network.

110
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If you look at shows, all of the shows on the network, thousands of shows on the network.

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Over 200, we produce co-produce or finance.

112
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And they're all making money, which is fantastic.

113
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You know, so I'd like to talk to you about that.

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We, of course, have videos, which we're just adding.

115
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We have some announcements to make, and we have some stuff to unveil in January.

116
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
In January, maybe the beginning of February, but I presume January.

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So that's something that I wanted to talk about.

118
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
How about the people?

119
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And what is it going to look like on television?

120
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You know, all of this stuff is I really have to sit down.

121
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
In fact, I know a great time when I'll be sitting down for about, let me think, ten hours when I fly home Sunday.

122
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Normally, fly home Saturday, but I'm flying home a day later.

123
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So when I hope fly home Sunday, I'm going to really prepare this.

124
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And I'll just do a real sit down.

125
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's not probably not going to be a show that everyone will want to listen to,

126
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
but those who are interested.

127
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm sure you will enjoy it.

128
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So I just have to get through, you know, I just have to organize my thoughts because it's so much.

129
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I say the sale with some splendor.

130
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Hey, wait a minute.

131
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Aren't we, uh, there's another, uh, another hell is it?

132
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I got another promotion starting tomorrow.

133
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's for a movie.

134
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Hold on a second.

135
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Let me just see.

136
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm not supposed to talk about it until tomorrow.

137
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What is it to stop the yard?

138
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's a new movie, which is coming out.

139
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What January 12th, stop the yard.

140
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh, that's right.

141
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yeah, it's centers around, uh, a troubled youth from Los Angeles attending the historically Black

142
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Truth University in Atlanta, Georgia.

143
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
When adapting to his new environment, it proves very difficult.

144
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

145
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Okay, so I get it.

146
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So we got a special podcast.

147
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We want you to listen to.

148
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'll talk about that tomorrow.

149
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So when I burp tomorrow, at least I'll know what the hell I have to promote.

150
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Hey, it's Thursday.

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You know what that usually means, don't you?

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's time once again to firm up the behind.

153
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Because you know when you hit 40 years, where they got to work on that ass.

154
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Amy.

155
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Hey, baby, how you doing?

156
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hello.

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You actually disappointed that last week was not a killer workout.

158
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah, it was kind of easy, you know?

159
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That makes my day dump in the next two weeks.

160
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Oh, no.

161
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Jump and kick.

162
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh, no.

163
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
No, name me.

164
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I didn't really mean it like that.

165
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Today we're going to be jumping.

166
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So get your mic situated.

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You can space as plenty of room to each side.

168
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah, sure.

169
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Take a deep breath and get ready.

170
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Do I have to put down the spliff?

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Is that the point?

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Okay.

173
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And the tea.

174
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You're going to start with feet together.

175
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Hands at your side.

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I want to still put down the tea.

177
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Okay.

178
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Now leave it to your left leg and jump a couple of feet to your left.

179
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Landing with your left knee slightly bent and your right leg lifts it just a little bit.

180
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So it's not touching the ground.

181
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Kind of like a leap and lizard thing like good.

182
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Now jump a few feet to your right.

183
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Letting the right leg land with knee bent and the left leg follow.

184
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But keeping the left foot a couple inches off the ground.

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What do I do?

186
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Good.

187
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Now back and forth to each side.

188
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Eight times.

189
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Eight jump.

190
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Squeeze your butt.

191
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's squeezing the butt.

192
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Make sure you land with your knee bent.

193
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I hit the, I hit the bankers rack.

194
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Breathe.

195
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Faster.

196
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Faster.

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Faster.

198
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh baby, faster.

199
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't hear you counting.

200
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh, six.

201
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Amy, oh, faster.

202
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Oh, that was fun.

203
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You did a good job.

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Well, I'll let you get back to your show.

205
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm off to do some test runs for my video show Fit Life that will hopefully launch

206
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
in January.

207
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Last week, I gave you a hard time about avoiding me in town.

208
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
This week, it's all my fault.

209
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm getting ready to leave for home and haven't been to the office.

210
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Well, where are you going?

211
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I will see you at the Christmas party, which I will be attending.

212
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Not as Amy Mac, but as podcast alley wife.

213
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Oh.

214
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So until next time.

215
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm doing this in front of the big open window.

216
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
We're not the open window, but the, I have these floor to ceiling windows all around the

217
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
condo.

218
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And there's the building this rink and hill tower, which is going to be the largest building

219
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
west of the Mississippi, 70 stories high.

220
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And there's probably like 15 construction workers all looking at me going like,

221
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
look at that boy.

222
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That boy's not right.

223
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That's not right.

224
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It reminds me someone sent me an awesome podcast.

225
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Let me just see if I can find the notes on it here.

226
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Here it is.

227
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
This is from John Hamilton.

228
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Adam, you've got to hear the impression this podcast is doing you.

229
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Doing a few of its funny is all hell.

230
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I know you're always looking for fresh and different things when it comes to podcasting.

231
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You have to hear this.

232
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Okay.

233
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What is it?

234
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Oblivion.lipsin.com.

235
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Hold on.

236
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I just got to load this up.

237
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Hold on a second.

238
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Where is it?

239
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Here we go.

240
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's, I don't know.

241
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's this show number three or four.

242
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
This, the accents are all off, but some of this shit is really funny.

243
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Check it out.

244
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Hello and welcome to another episode of road trip to oblivion.

245
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Today's episode takes place in the curry condo.

246
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Adam Curry is taking one too many hits on the curry crack rock.

247
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And decides to do an improv show where he does two reviews on iTunes.

248
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Both of them on the show, it fights with Don.

249
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You know, the fact check from Don and Drew.

250
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Anyways, the story behind this is that Jason just got on the road.

251
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Hey, hey, hey mother fucker.

252
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Lay off my girlfriend, okay?

253
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Nothing to talk about because this is his first and second day out.

254
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
He doesn't even done one delivery yet.

255
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But he wanted to do a show for you addicted mother fuckers to the show.

256
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And we just wanted to extend our gratitude to everyone who was download the show from Lipsin.

257
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
There's a lot of downloads considering that the fucking shit doesn't even work on iTunes yet.

258
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Fuck you.

259
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And you stupid cock sucking pieces shit.

260
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Run by fucking Steve Jobs and your fucking pants.

261
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Hide up to your fucking crotch and your balls hanging down like a fucking camel's neck.

262
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Fuck you asshole.

263
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Fix my fucking feed shit ball.

264
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm telling you, this is outrageous shit.

265
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You're late.

266
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Here I'm flicking the light.

267
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Oh, that's a good shit.

268
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Adam, put down the goddamn crack.

269
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm getting ready to take your proud out.

270
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
We got dead bitch.

271
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Can't you just fucking wait?

272
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I can't do a goddamn thing until I'm fucking big out of my goddamn mind.

273
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Ah, but if I'm wrong then, I have bad to find again.

274
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And show you my base content.

275
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Fine, what my base?

276
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What do you say base curtains?

277
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Oh, man, this is bad.

278
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Okay, you know what?

279
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You should not have a fuck of a buzz bitch.

280
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
That's wrong.

281
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Now let's get in when it's goddamn proud out already.

282
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I've got to go in the bathroom and shave my pussy.

283
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You know what Patricia?

284
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That picture that you keep continuously painting this morning.

285
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's getting more and more scarier.

286
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And it doesn't even matter how much fucking curry crack rock.

287
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I got runnin' through my veins.

288
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Alright.

289
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Alright.

290
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Oblivion.lipsin.com.

291
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That's pretty funny.

292
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That was alright.

293
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Let me see.

294
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's a more stuff in the notebook here.

295
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Ah, let me see.

296
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What was this?

297
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Ah, I'm like Feldebore.

298
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm sure this has been asked to you more.

299
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And once it's a possible to put Patricia's music on the pot set music network.

300
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I made it know it's part of some record companies.

301
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
They probably start to go bonkers if you suggested blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

302
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Okay.

303
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Now we can't do that actually.

304
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Can't legally do it.

305
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Anything that we've done and produced.

306
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
We can't put up anything that we own the masters to.

307
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Ah, and I'm sure I could get permission from these record companies to put it up on the pot set music network.

308
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But who the hell wants to go through that?

309
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Ah, here's it.

310
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I moved from Holland to Vancouver.

311
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Seven years ago experienced one earthquake.

312
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm in the middle of finally creating an earthquake kit.

313
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So when an earthquake hits, I actually have food for three days in water and cash, etc.

314
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
My question is, would it not be an interesting topic to discuss or get feedback from your listeners?

315
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I mean, your curry condo was on the 24th floor of a building situated on an earthquake central.

316
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Have you given any thought about what you would do in case of an earthquake?

317
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Ah, and I read that email.

318
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I thought, you know, that is kind of interesting because no doubt the, you know,

319
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
whenever I would come to San Francisco in the past before we, you know, had headquarters here,

320
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
you'd always think about it.

321
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Even Los Angeles.

322
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Los Angeles or San Francisco.

323
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You always think, oh, man, I hope the big one doesn't hit well.

324
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm here.

325
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And that goes away pretty quick.

326
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I haven't, this is really the first time in at least a year.

327
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I think I've thought about it.

328
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And honestly, I don't have an earthquake kit ready.

329
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And I really don't know what happened up here on the 24th floor.

330
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
There's a lot of big buildings that they've built in this,

331
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and I'm in the financial district right near right near the Bay Bridge.

332
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And I don't know.

333
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
As I said, I'm looking out the window.

334
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I see another 70, I think it's going to be 60 or 70 story building that they're,

335
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
that they're erecting.

336
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So I presume that these things are earthquake proof.

337
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Is that what everyone says?

338
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yeah, it's famous last words, I guess, right?

339
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But I should have an earthquake kit.

340
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So what do I need?

341
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Jim shoes, flashlight, water, pop tarts.

342
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I don't like that.

343
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Hi, I don't mean it's GD here from GD's by size bonus.

344
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I know what I need.

345
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Well, they're one of the organizers of podcast.

346
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Now, unfortunately, on Wednesday 29th November,

347
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
you were unable to make it down to the purple turtling camp,

348
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and then could you play Mr. Mum?

349
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But never mind.

350
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
All is not lost.

351
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Artists.

352
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Artists.

353
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Artists.

354
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Artists.

355
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Artists.

356
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Artists.

357
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Artists.

358
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Artists.

359
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Artists.

360
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Artists.

361
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Artists.

362
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Artists.

363
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Artists.

364
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Artists.

365
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Artists.

366
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Artists.

367
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Artists.

368
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Artists.

369
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Artists.

370
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Artists.

371
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Artists.

372
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Artists.

373
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Artists.

374
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Artists.

375
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Artists.

376
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Artists.

377
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Artists.

378
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Artists.

379
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Artists.

380
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Artists.

381
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Artists.

382
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Artists.

383
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Artists.

384
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Artists.

385
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
the first past life, breach of a new face of rip-bub in the form of the Union Streetrunner

386
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
as they take the stage of the Burble Turquered Camden, what is...punfest.

387
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So if you can get to Budfest, you're not going to miss out.

388
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You can listen to all three sets we call it live, from your listening pleasure.

389
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Exclusively to Potsho, delivering that work.

390
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yes, this is Punfest Live.

391
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Go to www.punfestlive.com

392
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
www.puncho.com

393
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Right on fest.

394
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
We need the best live music.

395
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
On fest.

396
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
On fest.

397
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
On fest.

398
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Well, plot this.

399
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I wish it could have been there.

400
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Sounds good, man.

401
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'll put it into my on-the-go channel on Pod Show.

402
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So it'll show up on my Nokia.

403
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And then I can use the Bluetooth headphones.

404
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I really got a system with that.

405
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm really digging that.

406
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
How I talked about that enough about the Nokia.

407
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It's completely replaced by Blackberry.

408
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The E61.

409
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Which includes the Wi-Fi.

410
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So Nokia has this awesome podcasting.

411
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Well, it's not really awesome.

412
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It really does the job.

413
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
There's a lot left to be desired.

414
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
But because you got Wi-Fi, essentially, you know,

415
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I have a couple channels set up and I have one that's called on the go.

416
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Set it up in my Pod Show Plus account.

417
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You can actually see what's on that channel if you go to Adam.podshow.com.

418
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And you look at channels I have.

419
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You can see what I collected in there.

420
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And so I just fire up the application before I leave the house.

421
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It connects on Wi-Fi.

422
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So it's nice to zip you fast.

423
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And I just say, go get everything new.

424
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And usually within like 10 minutes it'll have everything.

425
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Depending on the bandwidth where I am.

426
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The bandwidth at the condo is fucking rocking, by the way.

427
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
What was I gonna say?

428
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah, this is it, man.

429
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm so tired that I just can't keep my thoughts straight.

430
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I didn't get any email from John Glasscock.

431
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And he did some analysis, which I do appreciate.

432
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
He said the, the, the jazel guy who called yesterday said the jazel has been missing for four days.

433
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
He says he ran both voices through an analyzer.

434
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
He says, well, I'm not an expert.

435
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
They appeared to be a match.

436
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
CSI, CSI podcaster.

437
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Cool, John.

438
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
But he does say that, you know, there is some cause for concern.

439
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You should post her picture and alert the authorities.

440
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Uh, I don't think I can post the picture.

441
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
She sent to me.

442
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And by the way, I don't think it really help anyone

443
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I identify her unless you're in an interesting situation with her.

444
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Uh, I, I'm still not convinced.

445
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I don't know.

446
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm just not convinced.

447
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
That's what I mean.

448
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Um, so we'll see what happens.

449
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
We'll see if we hear for us.

450
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It was his name, Nick.

451
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
We'll see if we hear back from Nick.

452
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
He did say, where is it?

453
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Oh, shit.

454
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I got rid of it.

455
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Anyway, so I mean, we'll see what we hear.

456
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I didn't even hear anything.

457
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Nothing on the voicemail.

458
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Since that last call.

459
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Uh, but I, I don't know.

460
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I don't think I should start up anything.

461
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You know, if she's missing, then I think Nick is the guy who should

462
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
uh, who should call the authorities.

463
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So I try that test with you by giving you some voicemail dial tones.

464
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And if you hold up the mouthpiece of a standard telephone,

465
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
it won't work with your cell phone.

466
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It was standard phone.

467
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And you need an outside line.

468
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So that would be your house phone or your office phone,

469
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
if you know, dial an outside line.

470
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And you hold it up to the speaker while I play the,

471
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
the, the, the, the, the, the, this called the DMTF tones,

472
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
it's the touch tones and it actually dials the number.

473
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And I'm amazed how many people find this amazing.

474
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Yeah, we used to have phone dialers.

475
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And in fact, this is how you, you use this basic,

476
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
uh, method of dialing as a, it was a way to hack into public

477
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
phone systems back in the day even.

478
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You could completely circumvent all kinds of, you know,

479
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
charging mechanisms.

480
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
This has been around for a long, long time.

481
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Of course, with cell phones,

482
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
um, you don't really use it anymore.

483
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Except maybe you use those tones when, um,

484
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
um, you're in some kind of electronic system,

485
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
and they ask you to, you know, select a menu item.

486
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But I don't think it's really used to dial anymore.

487
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Because, you know, you dial the number first,

488
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
then you hit send or call or whatever on your phone,

489
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
and then it dials the number.

490
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Until you don't even hear the DMTF tones.

491
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Because, of course, they're not actually being transmitted.

492
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But I did get some interesting info on this.

493
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Uh, this is from John Kitts.

494
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
A couple of people sent me this.

495
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Uh, they googled on the use of dial tones.

496
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It is a US federal trade commission.

497
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It was the US federal trade commission that issued the so-called

498
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
900 rule, which in 308 decimal 3G states,

499
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
electronic tones and advertisements.

500
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It states that, and I quote,

501
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
the provider of pay-per-call services is prohibited from using

502
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
advertisements that emit electronic tones that can automatically

503
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
dial a pay-per-call service.

504
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Huh.

505
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Well, of course, it wasn't a pay-per-call,

506
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
other than your regular, you know, provider charges.

507
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
So I guess I'm okay there, but that's pretty interesting.

508
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So you can advertise using those numbers

509
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
as long as you don't charge for the call.

510
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Hmm.

511
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Well, I have one for you, folks.

512
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Uh, it's different.

513
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I decided, what are you going to call this?

514
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
The demon dialer.

515
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
There you go.

516
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
This is the demon dialer, and today's demon dialer,

517
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
and of course, you're all going to participate.

518
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Uh, this is someone who I haven't heard from in, uh,

519
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
in a couple of weeks, and I'm wondering why I haven't heard from him.

520
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And so I think you should call him and ask him that.

521
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Now, of course, what you really want to do is, is you want to record what you're,

522
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
you know, if you're going to call this person, record it,

523
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
so you can send it in and let us all, you know,

524
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
listen to how it went and when you found out who it was,

525
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
how the conversation went.

526
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So the demon dialer today is as follows.

527
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
For the US, hold up your, the mouthpiece of your phone

528
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
to the speakers right now.

529
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Of course, you can always put it on pause

530
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
while you get all that shit together.

531
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Make sure you have an outside line.

532
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And remember, you're going to say,

533
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
hi, this is the demon dialer.

534
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
When the person answers, and you'll say,

535
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
how can we have and heard from you for a while?

536
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Now, that's only if you're in the US.

537
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
If you're outside of the US in Europe,

538
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
here's your number.

539
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Uh,

540
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
folks on serious satellite radio,

541
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
just move on.

542
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I hope that works.

543
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I hope that someone records a phone call when they call this guy

544
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and say, hey, it's the demon dialer.

545
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Where the hell are you, asshole?

546
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Of course, we have a regular phone numbers open,

547
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
which you don't need the demon dialer for to access.

548
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:25,000
So if you're a Brit, that is the number you want to be calling in the UK.

549
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
So you want to keep that nice little jingle-med-lea memorise.

550
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
If you're in the US, clear your brain.

551
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Here comes your song.

552
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
One, two, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven.

553
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:48,000
One, two, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven.

554
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Hello Adam, it's Hugh from Pharaohs,

555
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
where it is Wednesday, 13th.

556
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Early evening, I'm not sure.

557
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I haven't heard you haven't heard the latest source card.

558
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm not sure if you're back from San Francisco.

559
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
But just to say that we are currently

560
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
is gone for the rest of the week at Pharaohs,

561
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
with our twin squirrel helicopter,

562
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
with the train modeling laser on it,

563
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
and would be delighted to see you if you happen to drop by.

564
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And I will show you how it all works.

565
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Also, you've got a neighbor in the hangar now.

566
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Somebody has come to live with us at Pharaohs,

567
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
with a wakeo, which is an utterly, utterly gorgeous aircraft.

568
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
An American built open cockpit by plane.

569
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's smaller than the steam and that got gorgeous.

570
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Anyway, hope to see you.

571
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Otherwise, hope San Francisco is okay.

572
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And if not, enjoy Christmas and speech in the new year by.

573
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
All right, Hugh.

574
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You know, there's so many cool people in aviation.

575
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And this will be one of my projects for 2007.

576
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I really am going to do this.

577
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I want to get my flying fools show up and running.

578
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It's all about aviation and the people that make it happen.

579
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You come to these airports, you landed airports.

580
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
All over the world, because I have flown all over the world.

581
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And you meet the most interesting people with the most interesting stories

582
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
with the most beautiful aircraft with, you know,

583
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
obsessions, love, disappointment, sorrow.

584
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It really, the emotions run the gamut.

585
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And in aviation, it's, I find it a really beautiful thing to see the passion that goes

586
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
into that.

587
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So my plan is to do a video show called flying.

588
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I think it's a flying fool or flying fools.

589
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Flying fools.

590
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Flying fool.

591
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It could be Adam Curry flying fool.

592
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
But that sounds more like I'm doing stunts or, or flying fools with Adam Curry.

593
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Or flying fools.

594
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Was there David?

595
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Niven.

596
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Or flying fools.

597
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Was Richard Attenborough.

598
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
There you go.

599
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Because, you know, look, look at the content that could go create.

600
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
God, I need a producer for that.

601
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I really do.

602
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
All right.

603
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
One last song.

604
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
This is going to be something that is not on the pod safe music network.

605
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It's sent to be by my friend.

606
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
David at Polito, known as that guitar man in New York.

607
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Of course, he's winding down his, his park appearance.

608
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I think he actually has wound down the park appearance,

609
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
is because now it's the winter.

610
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Unless so we get some kind of beautiful.

611
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Maybe an Indian summer type day, all of a sudden.

612
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You probably won't see him in the park, but he's doing.

613
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I love the company his podcast every single day.

614
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It's, it's really a joy to listen to.

615
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And let me just find the email that he sent to me because I want to set it up right.

616
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Uh, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

617
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Let's see.

618
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So he did his year-end concert.

619
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And I'm so bummed that, you know, I was out here.

620
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Actually, the six, I was in,

621
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I was back in the UK, I think.

622
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And we would have loved to have streamed it live,

623
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
but we just couldn't get any of that together with,

624
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
with a new pod show plus launch and all that stuff.

625
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Um, anyway, when David does a gig,

626
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
he, uh, he like, especially a big gig.

627
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
He likes to feature the, feature the men and women that, you know,

628
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
are behind him that are playing, uh, the band, essentially.

629
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And this year gave a solo to what he says is one of the most brilliant song

630
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
writers he's ever worked with.

631
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Uh, also one of the purest rock and roll piano players in town.

632
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
His name is George Wortsbach.

633
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And, uh, he sent me the recording.

634
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I think you'll like it because George has a pretty cool song for those of you who are married.

635
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
But now, I'm going to leave this stage.

636
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
We're going to leave this stage.

637
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And I'm sorry, but you're going to have to hang out for just a little while with him.

638
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I'm sorry, too.

639
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Well, thank you.

640
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I was waiting for them to turn a lights down because you people frighten me.

641
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I've been married for a little over 23 years.

642
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
More or less to the same woman.

643
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I say that because in the 23 years or so that we've been married, um,

644
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
she's changed, she's grown, she's evolved.

645
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So, bye.

646
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
But mostly because she makes me.

647
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And in that time, I've never, um, I've never written a love song.

648
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And so, you're about to hear the first love song I've ever written.

649
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Thank you.

650
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You might want to save your judgment.

651
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Most men live lives in quiet desperation, but not me.

652
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
My desperation's loud.

653
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And so it is, I'm taking your rejection like a man, a man who's freaking out.

654
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I admit, I have my flaws, I get drunk and with a bed.

655
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,000
But look beyond that, and I'm sure that you would love me.

656
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I'm a gentle man by far, but if you break my heart, I'll shoot your puppy.

657
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:15,000
My love is real, so is this pistol in my hand.

658
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And it's really loaded.

659
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You love your dog, but I wonder, will you love him more than me when his heads exploded?

660
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I am not the violent kind, I won't even swat that fly, but all this love stuff really makes my head claw.

661
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm a Christian man in part, but if you break my heart, he's a dead dog.

662
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Whoa, funny day, what can I say about the way you make me laugh when you told that dog to sick me?

663
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You clever girl, you call the cops while I was wiping off the drops of blood from where he bit me.

664
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:33,000
What's it been? Three weeks since I've been in, and today they're going to release me.

665
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:45,000
The doctor said, all the voices in my head are in my head, and she that was easy.

666
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And I know now I was wrong, and you won't see me no more, because I'm sedated with an order to restrain me.

667
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Oh, but if some night by chance, in some cosmic circumstance, we should cross paths while your dog is sniffing round and finds me hiding behind your couch.

668
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Mining my own business, and you scream so loud, you startle him, and he begins to attack me.

669
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So I fire with three or four warning shots above his head, but I hit you instead.

670
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,000
No one can blame me.

671
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:42,000
George Worsbach, live with David Ecolito, you know, thank God for podcasting man.

672
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You never, ever, ever hear this shit on the radio.

673
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Otherwise, it would become just a lost art form, only to be performed in theaters, and we just never hear of it again.

674
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
So thank God for that.

675
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
All right, tomorrow we'll be food bar Friday. I've seen some suggestions coming for songs.

676
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm looking for more twisted sisters, even sent in their ID.

677
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
So everyone, did you see him last night? They were on Leno? I think?

678
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Yeah, Leno, or was it Letterman? No, I think was Leno.

679
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Twisted sister doing a song that's on the Podsake Music Network, the Christmas song.

680
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I love it. Okay, so tomorrow we're going to have a good jam. We have some good times.

681
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And in the meantime, if you got anything to send to me, add them at podshow.com.

682
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Or of course, if you're looking for stuff that was that appeared in today's program, daily source code.com.

683
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
