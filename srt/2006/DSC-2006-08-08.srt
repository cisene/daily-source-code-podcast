00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
This is Soccer Girl. I just listened to the first episode of Shadow Falls and it's scared me

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,520
crapless.

Daily source code episode 437.

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,240
It was $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,280
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:51,280
This is Rob and with another content call, over 80-40 minutes, come on.

10
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,720
Time to go lose in my mind this time.

11
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,080
It happens to me.

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,680
I'm falling deeper into you.

13
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,440
We still need fun, no my name.

14
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:34,400
We are holding every bowl in this ordinary world.

15
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,840
I am falling now, reborn.

16
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,120
Extraordinary girl.

17
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,800
This is a button I still remember the day.

18
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,160
Man, come on, then you to me away.

19
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,440
Dream to let you know that I still do this way.

20
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,680
Daily, every time I still lose in my mind this time.

21
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,680
It happens to me.

22
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,120
I'm falling deeper into you.

23
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:23,840
We are holding every bowl in this ordinary world.

24
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,360
I am falling now, reborn.

25
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,320
Extraordinary girl.

26
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,760
This is a button I still remember the day.

27
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,840
Better all to sleep.

28
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,920
Time to go lose in my mind this time.

29
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
It happens to me.

30
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,520
I'm falling deeper into you.

31
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,520
We are holding every bowl in this ordinary world.

32
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:04,800
This is Rob and with another content call, over 80 minutes, come on.

33
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:50,720
Extraordinary girl, I'm falling now, reborn.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,520
Jack in the pulpit, ordinary girl, from the pod save music network.

35
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,960
On episode number 437 of the Daily source code,

36
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,160
hey everybody how you doing?

37
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,080
Coming to you from the curry cottage.

38
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,680
In the affluent suburb of Surrey known as Gilford, Gilford.

39
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,960
And as you can tell, no Patricia on the show today.

40
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,720
Ah, I'm a little bit bummed about that.

41
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,520
I made a huge estimation error.

42
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,800
Now guys, if you're married or if you live with your girl,

43
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,040
you've always got to watch out for the signs.

44
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,000
You've got to think about why things are happening and not happen.

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,120
I was so stupid.

46
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:30,080
How could I think that one day before Patricia's sister comes for a visit for a week

47
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,760
that she would have any time for me.

48
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,480
Of course not.

49
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,760
Now I understand what's been happening for the past two days.

50
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,040
You know, it's like all this cleaning, all this stuff has to be fixed and worked out

51
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,760
and like everyone's got tasks and jobs.

52
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,520
And of course you give a teenager a job and teenagers won't do crap or we'll do it half

53
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,320
heartedly, right?

54
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,800
And so this morning, of course, she's doing her hair and so if I hope you understand,

55
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,400
I'm just going to step away from any energy there.

56
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,600
There's another thing I've noticed though.

57
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,080
Patricia has no idea how much you guys like her on the show.

58
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,800
Yeah, I tell her all the time and I forward her comments and stuff.

59
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,400
I think it's time we get on a little campaign here and let her know how much we love her on the

60
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:19,760
Charlie send an email to Patricia at curie.com and let her know what you think.

61
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,760
Hey, got some cool parts of music lined up.

62
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:28,720
Plenty of voice calls, promos, brand new sponsor, which is I think you'll like.

63
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,480
And some things that came into the email box.

64
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,520
Let me see, this is a couple of people passed this one on to me.

65
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:44,240
It's this awesome, awesome site called goggles, which is, um, it's kind of a mashup of the

66
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,960
Google, I think it's the Google Maps API and just, I don't know, as a flash, whatever funky stuff.

67
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,960
I have no idea how it works, but essentially you can choose a city.

68
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,160
I think it's New York London.

69
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,640
I think that's Singapore in there and you fire this webpage and you're actually flying a little

70
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,320
plane, a little, I mean, it's a, it's a render is a drawing of a plane, but you're flying a little

71
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,000
plane, um, over the city and you can, um, you can go up and altitude, go down, you can, uh,

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,400
bank left, bank right. It, it's very, it doesn't quite go up high enough for my taste.

73
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,560
You know, I can't, you can't really see exactly where you are and it's missing some of the

74
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,080
UI bits that as a pilot it would be very handy to know where the alarm flying was extremely cool.

75
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,960
And I put a link in today's show notes for you to check it out, uh, it's called Goggles.

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,200
See something that came in that was circulating through the potto severe yesterday, apparently

77
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:42,560
Brad Pitt, uh, makes, and I don't know if, if Brad Pitt calls it a podcast or not, but, uh,

78
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,440
according to the mirror, it's the mirror that, uh, the post of this, um, oh, the, the link

79
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,760
actually comes from China daily. You'll have to read it for yourself.

80
00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:00,000
Uh, but apparently, while Brad Pitt is away from, uh, from Maddox and uh, and Angelina and,

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,880
and how many kids do they have now three? Uh, he makes, and this is the quote,

82
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,760
sends private internet podcast to Maddox and in turn Maddox will turn, uh, five in a few days,

83
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,960
sends films of his paintings and bicycle stunts. It's a personal podcast. I just wonder if they

84
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,400
actually call it a podcast in the paid household. And something you've got to go look at,

85
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,000
uh, um, Jay Donley has been working on this. It says now the fourth episode and I think he's

86
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,920
finally gotten it to where it's, it's, what I once talked about and he really developed a vision

87
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:40,880
around the concept of podcast doing a test drive in an automobile. And he's, um, I think it's his wife,

88
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,920
and she's now known as the test drive girl. They go to, uh, to new card dealerships and, uh,

89
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
they test drive and they basically film it. And, and of course, half the fun is looking at the

90
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,920
idiotic sales guy. I think that they were denied a couple of places, but finally, it really is a

91
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,720
great test drive, you know, and, and you look at all the features and you kind of get to just

92
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,360
hang out and drive along. Um, so I'll link to that in the show notes as well for test drive

93
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:14,720
girl episode number four out now, continuing, uh, in our contest, a new contest, which if started,

94
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,440
I don't even know what the prize is going to be yet, but I think we're going to have to really

95
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,440
up the stakes because no one has gotten it right. At the end of every single podcast on the

96
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:28,880
pod show podcast delivery network, you hear a little promo tag and the, uh, the text is, uh,

97
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:35,600
get this podcast, another one, other great ones like it, um, on the high performance podcast delivery

98
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:42,080
network, um, from pod show and limelight networks. And then there's this female voice that kind of

99
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:48,000
floats through there going, I love it. So skip to the end of the show or, or, or any other podcast,

100
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,440
a pod show podcast to hear the voice and you tell me who it is. I had a miss Brian on second

101
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,920
life on Brian's notes. I've also emailed you a bunch of times, but that's nothing. Anyway, I'm thinking

102
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:09,120
that the voice must be as a lovely Patricia. I'm, uh, 57 year old listener, um, and I'm a folder.

103
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,400
Yeah. No, despite your obvious higher intelligence being a folder, you're wrong. Sorry.

104
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,960
It is not Patricia. Uh, it is not someone who currently has a podcast per se,

105
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,160
although she, and I got to give you some hints to get you to get you going there. She is a member,

106
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,120
uh, an indirect member of the pod show family. I have to have to say a direct member of the pod show

107
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:40,160
family, and she has been discussed on, uh, certainly one, maybe two podcasts. And does, in fact,

108
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:48,000
just recently, she was discussed on a podcast that belongs to the pod show lineup. It's not Patricia.

109
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,800
It's not Angie B. Everyone's posting comments at dailysourcecode.com. Get your, you know,

110
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,320
that's the best way to register your answer, obviously. So that I have a time and date stamp

111
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,720
is to when you, uh, when you actually putting your answer. So dailysourcecode.com, leave a message

112
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:09,760
under today's podcast episode number 437. It's not Patricia. Oh, man. This is going to be good. I,

113
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,800
I think I got to come up with, uh, with a really good prize. I'm a little tired of giving away iPods.

114
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,640
Maybe we should just give away a different brand. You know, something, uh, a really nice one from a,

115
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,400
of a different brand. Give me a suggestion about that as well, if you will. Hey, Adam,

116
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:31,760
just downloaded, uh, Shane number 436 Monday, the 7th of August. Um, I don't know what's up with it.

117
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:40,800
All, um, if this problem with castblaster, that's after 25 seconds, um, it's the MP3 stops playing

118
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:49,680
nightings. Um, if you fast forward it, just after 25 seconds, places normal. So, uh, thought,

119
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:57,840
I'm just like, you know, and, uh, yeah, there you go. Bye. Folder scruncher, huh? Yeah, thanks.

120
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,880
Uh, you know, this is a problem we've seen in the past. Uh, something that, uh, I think probably

121
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,720
a couple months ago, uh, it, uh, it cropped up. I'm pretty sure it has to do with our de-gap system,

122
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,640
dynamically, uh, generated audio placement, which puts in the ads for shadow falls and, uh,

123
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,920
and go daddy and the, uh, and the promo at the end, uh, which, of course, you can win a fantastic

124
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,840
prize by guessing who the voices that says I love it. Um, uh, you know, so obviously we're looking

125
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:31,440
into it. We're going to get it fixed. It, it's interesting that it only happens with iTunes and

126
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,920
subsequently when being played on an iPod, which, of course, is a huge market. So we've got to fix

127
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,680
it, no doubt about it. Um, but there is something weird about iTunes that that I've noticed that

128
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,280
iTunes actually rewrites the MP3 file when it comes in. So, you know, if, if you have it set the

129
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,120
download the show or if you're downloading it through a channel and it comes into iTunes and that's how

130
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,080
you sync it up to your iPod. And of course, if it's housed in iTunes, they'll get housed on your iPod.

131
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,480
Um, so it leaves our place perfectly and if you, uh, and if you, uh, drop it into iTunes

132
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,360
manually. Oh, actually, that's something you could try. Please, because this worked for me, if you

133
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,320
download the file and then put it into iTunes manually, does it still have the same problem? I don't

134
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:19,360
think it will. Because with podcasts, iTunes does something very peculiar, which, um, I would have

135
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,640
expected a lot of people to be up in arms about, but I've not heard hardly anyone ever talk about it.

136
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:30,720
If you create an MP3 file and you put in your ID3 tags, you know, so that the title and the, and the

137
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,960
the author, et cetera, is all, is all set. If it's downloaded via iTunes from a podcast feed,

138
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,920
iTunes actually rewrites the ID3 tags. It takes away the information you put in there and puts in,

139
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,520
I think the first couple lines of the show notes of the description, which is, well, it's not the

140
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,360
way I sent it out. It's the way that, you know, it's what's happening on the other end. And I think

141
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,320
because of this rewriting, something is getting garbled with, uh, with de-gap insertions. It's

142
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,720
probably, it has to do with the timing issue, but um, working on it, trying to fix it, uh, but very,

143
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,040
amazed, actually, I should say, um, about the fact that iTunes is rewriting every single file,

144
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,560
rewriting the ID3 tags, which is kind of, you know, breaking my authorship there. You know,

145
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,840
I wanted to say something else, not what you determined it to be. Two for Tuesday, if you're

146
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:28,000
listening to us on the serious stars 102, the serious satellite radio network. Yeah, we pulled a

147
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,560
really old concept out of our ass, two for. So on Tuesdays, besides the lineup that we have

148
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,160
scheduled for you, which I'm going to pull up right now, uh, which, of course, has, uh, daily source

149
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,720
code kicking it off. And we've got Don and Drew actually pod show LA is, uh, is next after daily

150
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,480
source code. It won't be a pacific host, uh, hellway today. It will be, where's my fucking latte,

151
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,040
stories of personal assistance in Hollywood? You have to listen to that show if you've never heard it.

152
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,680
Don and Drew after that, then the rumor girls, and then in our two for Tuesday, on the, the

153
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,240
roaming slots, we've got, uh, pod save the queen will be on at eight to eight o'clock this evening.

154
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,000
East Coast time, and perfect head will be the show after that from eight thirty to nine o'clock.

155
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,680
Then East radio and Scott Sigler to wind it up, uh, here on serious stars 102. Let's see,

156
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,920
one more from the inbox. Now that's from my buddy Tom from from down under, he says he just bought

157
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,160
a swim P3. Have you heard of one of these? Swim P3. So W, S, W, I, M, P3. It's a small

158
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:38,720
MP3 player that sits on the back of your, uh, swimming goggles and transmits the sound into your

159
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,680
skull via bone conductive technology. Patricia, I tried that out just the other night.

160
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,360
Basically, it vibrates the sound into your temples inside of your ear. It works beautifully. The first

161
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,840
few tracks were songs, then the DSC came on somewhere after the first kilometer of swimming.

162
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:02,240
As I started, I thought to myself, with one hundred and forty four dollars,

163
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,320
with an MP3 player strapped to my head. And the next generation of radio content being

164
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:13,680
vibrated into my skull. I think I look like a dickhead in the pool. All right Tom,

165
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,400
Bod said music now for Kevin Reeves on the daily source code.

166
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,720
It's as late as the man that's a kick-ass. Throw me a line.

167
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:51,120
Is there any way out in here? Is there some way to make this clear?

168
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:05,440
Because of you, I can't sleep any more since you walked out the door and you left me.

169
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,320
All I do is stare at the wall and you know, bumps at all,

170
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,560
except for memory. While you want to try to be insane,

171
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:26,480
what you want to cause me so much pain. Throw me a line.

172
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:34,480
I don't think I can't make it on my own. Throw me a line.

173
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:43,120
I afraid that I might die even on the long way. Show me a side.

174
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:50,720
Tell me that you're still in love with me when you throw me a line.

175
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,720
I can't feel, so no darkness will lie,

176
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,800
I don't know daytime from night, haunted space in.

177
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:10,000
Yes, it's real. Oh, well, I wake up from this and the mist of your tears and embrace it.

178
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:19,920
What they're in my sports too. I don't think I can make it without you.

179
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:28,240
Throw me a line. I don't think I can't make it on my own.

180
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:36,800
Throw me a line. I afraid that I might die even on the long way.

181
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:51,280
Show me a side. Tell me that you're still in love with me when you throw me a line.

182
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,440
I don't think I can make it without you.

183
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:11,440
Throw me a line. I don't think I can't make it on my own.

184
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:23,440
Throw me a line. I don't think I can make it on my own.

185
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:33,200
Throw me a line. I afraid that I might die even on the long way.

186
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:47,040
Show me a side. Tell me that you're still in love with me when you throw me a line.

187
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:56,240
Throw me a line. I don't think I can't make it on my own.

188
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:04,240
Throw me a line. I don't think I can't make it on my own.

189
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:12,240
Throw me a line. I don't think I can't make it on my own.

190
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:19,440
Throw me a line. I don't think I can't make it on my own.

191
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,000
I have some quality shape right there.

192
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,880
Kevin Reeves threw me a line from the Pods' music network,

193
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,560
link in the show notes today at sourcecode.com.

194
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:50,720
This is AB 50. I can't believe he's real hard to tell you what type of password he is.

195
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:57,440
AB from Conradweedil.com is a folder that's right, but I do have a question for you.

196
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,360
What is that with scrunchies? I just don't get that stuff.

197
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,600
What happened? You scrunch around your finger and you got good coverage on one part.

198
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,160
Under scrunch, another part. You're going to end up with like a stinky finger.

199
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,240
And that's got to happen. All the damn time when you're wiping, sit off your ass.

200
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,800
I mean, I just don't get it. I mean, I'm a folder myself, so anyway.

201
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:27,760
If anyone can tell your show and your fans with scrunchies, that would be cool.

202
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,080
This is AB, this is that. And just remember, if you ever want to talk about data-based it,

203
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:39,520
for RFF alone with technology. You know, sit around, talk about that stuff. Anyway,

204
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,520
with that fan, so please out.

205
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,600
Did I hear some of you? James Brown, got bucket.

206
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,520
You're someone said to me the other day, says, hey, man, you know, podshow,

207
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,400
paid James Brown to put his song up on the pods of music network.

208
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,520
I was like, wow, great idea. I wish he'd been that smart.

209
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,560
Fold of scruncher. Yeah, the controversy, controversy continues. What is better?

210
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:13,520
What is best? Is it genetics? Yesterday we gave away the iPod in the contest.

211
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,120
Troy needs an iPod.com. Create a better domain name, register it to make us laugh.

212
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,560
And announce the winner have not yet actually officially heard from the winner. Of course,

213
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:30,320
it's possible that she didn't hear that she'd won yet because not everyone's on the same

214
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,720
listening schedule. But we have some insight into all about the winner. Hey, Adam. It's Rebecca from

215
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:44,640
Tranny Recredo. You can find my show at TrannyRect.com. Yada-yada-fucking-yada. I'm also six-foot-one

216
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:51,920
and fat enough to play college football. Anyways, the reason I'm calling is because I wanted to

217
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,040
reveal the identity if you haven't already figured it out. The identity of your iPod winner.

218
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:10,320
He is actually a she, her name is Marty Abernathy. She is frequently appears on multiple shows

219
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:17,680
on the Trans-FM radio network. She's also been on my show. You can hear all about her by listening

220
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:26,240
to Tranny Rec episode 22. Anyways, since I know that she is listening to the source code,

221
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:34,160
I just wanted to say Marty, what the fuck? Quit wasting toilet paper, start folding and save the

222
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:43,120
god damn planet. So I got- What is that Trans-FM radio? Is that radio or is that a podcast?

223
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,720
I got to listen to that. You have something that's something interesting going on over there for sure.

224
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:54,720
Your one voice has strength. Many voices have power.

225
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,080
Join your fellow podcasters, bloggers and new media experts in podcamp Boston on September 9th

226
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,280
10th. Learn from each other, teach each other, and lend your voice to the power of many.

227
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,520
For more information visit www.podcamp.org.

228
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,520
That's kind of a cool idea. You know, there's been all these food camps and bar camps and

229
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,840
blog camps and camp camps and whatever the heck. And it seems to be a version of an on conference

230
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,320
kind of a gathering where you have some, you're usually consists of a wiki in a place to go hang out.

231
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:45,440
And it seems like a really good idea. These kind of ad hoc organist, organist, organist, organist,

232
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:52,960
organist gathering. Senior is pretty fun. So this is a podcamp which I think is taking place

233
00:23:52,960 --> 00:24:00,560
September 9th and 10th. I will definitely post a link to that site in the show notes for

234
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:06,320
a quick handy and easy reference at dailysourcecode.com. But it sounds like something cool.

235
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,480
Now it's very interesting that they're holding this event on the east coast. In fact,

236
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:17,360
I saw someone actually bill it as, what is it, the podcast Expo east? That's very interesting

237
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:24,400
that doing that so close to the podcast Expo. Let's talk like two weeks later in Ontario,

238
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,720
California. So let me know. I saw that Steve Garfield is going to be there. I'm sure because it's

239
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,200
I think it's Boston, CC Chapman will be hanging out. It sounds like that's going to be a

240
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,680
pretty cool deal. Damn. Maybe I should go. That'll be, it's a shorter trip for me. That's for sure.

241
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,320
If you're listening to us on a serious starts one or two up next, you're going to hear where the

242
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,680
fuck is my latte? Stories of Hollywood personal assistance as codified by Mark Yoshimoto

243
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,960
name cough and joy. Meanwhile, back over here, we've got, I didn't know actually that

244
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:03,680
Angie B had participated in our earth link ad challenge where you make the advertising. And then

245
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:10,880
as it turns out today, I got to the list of finalists in. So I think there's like 10 different ads.

246
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,080
They could either be a song. It could be a jingle. It could be an endorsement. It could be a

247
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:22,160
straight ahead produced commercial. And my girl Angie B is one of the finalists. This is Angie B

248
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:30,880
independent musician and podcaster. So I joined Love Spirals in very late 1998, which was right around

249
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:37,200
the time when MP3s were coming into Vogue. And internet radio was getting started. Both things

250
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:44,000
I was very excited about. But with dial-up service, it was a real nightmare for me trying to upload

251
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,040
MP3s to the internet. I cried many evenings trying to get through to get those big files up.

252
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,600
So I was pretty excited to try out DSL for the first time. I mean, once again, this was right

253
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:06,480
when broadband was super cutting edge. Well, I called Earthlink to get set up with DSL because I was

254
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,600
lucky enough to live in LA where they were rolling out some of the services early. And boy,

255
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,160
did it change my life? I mean, there was absolutely no turning back for me after that.

256
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:22,560
As an independent musician, being connected to the internet at high speed 247 is a real

257
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,840
godsend. And Earthlink made it really simple for me to stay connected to my fans and to make

258
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:34,240
my music available worldwide. Wow. And she put her own music in it. Cool.

259
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:41,200
Alright, Angie B. Going for the big, was it two grand? Something like that. And I know Angie

260
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:48,400
reasonably well in a cyber way that is. We hung out in second life. We email a lot and

261
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:56,320
you know, I listened to her show, of course. And I have to say that she's probably a real regular

262
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,720
user of technology. It doesn't know a hell of a lot about it, but it's very smart. So configure

263
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,560
stuff out if it's reasonably well explained. So from her coming from her, I say that's a huge

264
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:13,120
endorsement. Now I just love listening to Angie B. Angie, we maybe we should do some,

265
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:18,160
maybe we should ask Pod Show LA if they can write us some kind of like a Wayne and Wanda

266
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:23,280
drama where we can just do a short little love dialogue, you know, a couple times a week.

267
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,080
It'll be really good. I think our voices will be perfect together. And imagine if we

268
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:34,560
recorded them separately, that could be a kind of hot actually. I'll talk to Yoshimo to Nemcoff

269
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:39,680
today about them. Hey Adam, it's Heather for movie for radio. And I was listening to DSC 436.

270
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:46,400
And what the hell playing two female artists in the same show has that ever happened before? I mean,

271
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,680
my show is all girls all the time, but for the most part girls get ignored. So thanks for playing

272
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,920
those two awesome artists. And if your listeners get tired of hearing the same boys played over

273
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:01,600
and over and over, they can check out RubyFruit Radio at RubyFruitRadio.com, where it's all girls,

274
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:09,520
all the time. Hey, all girls all the time. Told you I had a brand new sponsor on the Pod Show

275
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:18,400
podcast network. It's Akira. And Akira has a new car that they're out pimping. It's the

276
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:25,520
Akira RDX. It's an SUV. And so they came to us about advertising on the network and said, okay,

277
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,640
well, you know, we are trying to change advertising. So, you know, we don't think the straight ahead

278
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,120
32nd spots is really going to cut it. What can we do that's different? And we came up with what we

279
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,560
call a target cast. Those of you who have listened to some of the strategy cast, probably or a

280
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:46,480
year ago or so, heard us talk. And I think I was spoken about this before. The whole concept of a

281
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,720
strategy cast is where across the network, we talk about a specific podcast, which is all about the

282
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,480
product. So it's really, it's if you're interested, you'll go over there and you'll listen to the podcast

283
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:05,680
or podcasts as in this case, it turns out. So, you know, really, it's almost like our version of

284
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:10,480
the infomercial only is not hokey. And I'll tell you why it's not hokey because we said, look,

285
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:17,600
we'll make a target cast. And you can find this at Akira.podshow.com, Akira, ACURA, Akira.

286
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:24,080
Podshow.com. We, you know, let's make it into content. You know, you have an interesting car.

287
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,960
Oh, by the way, little memo to self, got to get the test drive girl to do a test drive with the

288
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:39,520
Akira without their knowledge, of course. So, if you go to akira.podshow.com, I think they have

289
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:47,120
either one or two, maybe it's the second episode isn't up yet. But it's interviews and it's

290
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:55,280
interviews done by by podcasters. So, you know, no like fake voices coming in and reading from

291
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:02,480
a script. But really just having a conversation with, in this case, okay, so here's the, the first

292
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,800
one is with Grammy winner, Elliott Shiner. And he's worked with, he's worked with a lot of people,

293
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,440
most notably probably the Eagles. He was involved in designing the Akira RDX surround sound system.

294
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:21,600
This car is basically an iPod on wheels, if you will. And then Mark Williams of, I think he's

295
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:28,880
an editor of Motor Trend magazine. Also talks about the Akira RDX competitors, features, etc.

296
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,960
I haven't driven this myself, but it does seem like it's got a lot of cool toys in it. But anyway,

297
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:41,520
the whole point being this advertisement that you'll hear at akira.podshow.com is content.

298
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:48,800
It's really, it's a good listen. Listen to what Williams, what's his name, winner.

299
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,640
Elliott Shiner, you could tell I'm reading at the same time trying to remember. My brain is so

300
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,760
farad. Listen to that first show and tell me that you didn't like it because if you're into a sound,

301
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,560
if you're into cars, if you're into sound in cars, which by the way is an as you'll hear in that

302
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:09,920
interview is a really important part of the recording process is listening to what it sounds like

303
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,160
on your car speakers. I think you'll like it. Accurate.podshow.com. Go check it out.

304
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,760
Let me know what you thought too, by the way. I really do care.

305
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,360
Hi, Adam. This is Peter. I'll listen from Australia. Two things I want to cover.

306
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,280
First up, you put out a call to get to know your listeners. Well, I'm an aircraft technical writer

307
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:35,920
who's pushing 40 listening to your show on my PDA when traveling home. I'll listen to the DSC

308
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,320
because you have an uncanny knacker putting a smile on my face even after a shitty day.

309
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,000
Just something about the way you put the show together. I don't do my own podcast,

310
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,040
but I will put in a word for another podcast I like. It's called The Small Room.

311
00:31:51,040 --> 00:32:00,000
And you can find it at www.thesmallroom.net. The second thing is that I have a minor gripe about the

312
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,480
PMM. Some labels have been uploading some of their artist songs, which is great, but they put

313
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,480
their label name in the band name column. That means the band name and the song name are smashed

314
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:18,880
together in the song name column. That makes it a pain in the arse to read, so I just skip those songs

315
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:25,920
completely. One example is a whole series of tracks uploaded by K records. Can we get another

316
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:32,400
column put in for a label name if the track has one please? Well, that's about it.

317
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,880
I reckon I must owe you a beer for all the smalls you've given me on the train. When you make

318
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,320
it out to Oz, sing out. No, shout your one down at the pub. Cheers. Oh. Scrunch up.

319
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,880
Yeah, of course. You're from down under. Expect no. A lot of guys in it. A lot of aviation

320
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:55,200
guys are scrunchers. I've noticed. PMM. Yeah, absolutely. That's one of the changes that's planned.

321
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,960
In fact, we're even thinking about taking a little bit further. Besides having artist song,

322
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,400
it would make sense to maybe have an album tag in there. Of course, a label,

323
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,120
because you're right. That's incorrect. I mean, it's not incorrect. It's the only way we're able to

324
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:17,120
do it with the system the way it is today. How about venue? That's something that I thought would

325
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,680
might be interesting. If you look at Pod Show Plus and how all of that would integrate where

326
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,440
you can be a podcaster, but you could also be a venue if you have a big backyard or if you

327
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,880
haven't venue. And why wouldn't you attach artists to your venue? So people can easily navigate.

328
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,200
This is what the whole social media network is about, is how you connect all these different things.

329
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,160
Oh, man, we had a great conversation yesterday about, you know, the next, the next couple releases

330
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:45,040
that we're going to do. It's, it's, you've seen now we've put the un-bata sign up at the top,

331
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,600
because it is, it is still beta, but man, we are working hard and bringing in new features all the

332
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,160
time. And I think in the next couple weeks, we'll, I'll, I should be able to announce and list all the

333
00:33:54,160 --> 00:34:00,960
things that either have changed or about to change. And, you know, we continue to fix bugs and

334
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:09,040
annoyances throughout the day. For you, interested in my aviation hobby, I have to go to the

335
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,880
Netherlands to visit Casplastre Mike. We have, you know, we have to sit down and chat about, well,

336
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:20,880
about, you know, the final release I would say of Casplastre. You know, we've talked a lot about

337
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,520
a Casplastre pro, not quite sure where we stand with that, or, you know, we've got to think about that,

338
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,600
also Casplastre for video. And, you know, just, you know, not just a quick Skype chat. This is,

339
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:36,880
you know, like a couple hours sit down, hang out. So, here's what I've done. I told him that I

340
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:42,320
would come visit him in the Netherlands. He lives not far from an airfield where, that I've been

341
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:48,480
too before, it's pretty accessible. But it'll be during the week. Now, I was thinking about maybe

342
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,120
this week, but, you know, with Patricia's sister coming and just a lot of stuff going on. And,

343
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,200
although the weather today actually would be pretty much perfect. I looked at the Maytars and Tafs

344
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,720
and it would have been great. It's going to happen next week. Sometime midweek probably,

345
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:10,160
and it will be my first solo crossing of the English channel. And, uh, it's a little daunting.

346
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,360
It's, you know, kind of a Lindbergh-airhardt feel that I've got there. And, and I will be recording

347
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,840
the whole thing. So, from start to finish, and I wanted you to know that in the event that,

348
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,320
that I don't make it, you know, uh, my end, my I River, I'm sure will contain the recording,

349
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,960
because it's solid state. So, once it's on, it can short out, but it'll still be in the memory.

350
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,960
So, make sure you get that, because that'll have some great fucking sound. Okay.

351
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,600
What was the other thing? What's something else? Okay. That was it. All right.

352
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:48,560
Couple, uh, voicemail, uh, feedbacks through our voicemail line, which you might now hopefully have

353
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:56,560
programmed into your cell phone, plus two-o plus one for the US-201-625-6357,

354
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,040
in the UK plus four four two zero seven six eight one three seven five three.

355
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,720
Two calls I want to play for you that came in about numbering the shows. I question yesterday.

356
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:14,160
You know, how long should I keep talking about which number episode it is? You know, should I go all the way up to 10,000?

357
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:20,400
Is that what I should be doing? Hey Adam, it's Jerry from anapolis, and I was up into Charlie 436.

358
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,840
And I, I too had that thought about the numbering scheme, which initially was really great,

359
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:32,560
because for those of us who were listening to it on an iPod and searched for the latest steps

360
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,480
to, that sort of thing, it was really nice to be able to see the number and kind of mentally remember,

361
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,160
oh yeah, I hadn't heard that one yet or whatever, and to hear it audibly at the first thing in the,

362
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,800
in the field, or near the first thing that you have these insertions. That's great.

363
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,920
Now the issue obviously is that the scales, you know, the numbering gets a little app out of

364
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,200
the radio just and it almost sounds a little bit, you know, as if you're bragging, you know,

365
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,520
hey, I want to show 10,000. So instead, you know, there are some things mainstream,

366
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:12,080
maybe media and publishing do well, and it has some good ideas, I suppose, and one of them would be

367
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:19,920
the notion of season numbers or volume numbers, that sort of thing, so you can keep the episode numbers

368
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:27,440
down to it all raw. So you can have something like, you know, season four, episode 10, that's

369
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:34,000
sort of thing, and it's still numbering and still is a one-up thing that a serial number if you

370
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:41,840
will, that people can relate to, but it's not quite too cumbersome to get around looking down

371
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:46,880
the future here. So anyway, my two cents worth, it's country.

372
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:54,240
I'm not bad there for a scruncher, some good thoughts, and there were some contrary and

373
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:02,720
views, of course. Start eight, four, seven, nine, four, five. Um, this is good doctrine from the

374
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,480
carcass, come to you live from beautiful sunny Seattle, Washington. Yep, for a change it is sunny

375
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,480
you're calling and respond to your Monday episode, and your question about whether or not we should

376
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,760
be using numbers that are getting a podcast, the numbering, which episode it is, and I got to tell

377
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,600
you, if it was good enough for John Luke's a car and Captain Kirk, it's damn well good enough

378
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:30,160
for Adam Curry. Boulder. Yeah, of course, Jamie is my friend. Yeah, you know, listening to a

379
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,920
couple of those comments, I finally figured it out. It's real simple. Why don't you guys

380
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,760
create the tags for them? You know what number I'm at, you know what number I need, send in a couple,

381
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,000
you know, make it a little more entertaining. I think that's probably the best thing we can do.

382
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,560
It can be just a voicemail. You call in. It can be a little piece you produce. I don't care.

383
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,680
Send it in. What are we out today? I mean, the 437 is not what I said. Yeah, we're at 437 today.

384
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,760
Send in the, you know, send in another 50 or something. So I have a little stack and can just pull

385
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,480
from it. That of course is the way we do it here on the chat. Yeah. Hey Adam and Seth,

386
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,360
Paul Parkinson from Pressing 12 and Paul Parkinson magazine. I just had a quick one, mate.

387
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,960
Thanks very much for having this voice now. I think it really works extremely well.

388
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,640
I'm Jennifer's kind of say I love it. I mean, absolutely awesome. And I'm just looking

389
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,440
forward to episode 3 and 4 on however many more you do. And just want to say that. Thanks

390
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:29,120
very much. Oh, and, um, Boulder. Yeah, of course. I figured as much.

391
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:35,120
Hey, we got some more cool shows coming out of Pod Show LA, including Flashers Universe.

392
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:41,120
You're going to crap yourself when you see that. Here's new leaf from the Pod Save Music Network.

393
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:15,040
Yeah, those amazing worlds I never thought I had. She said, yeah, just close your eyes.

394
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:27,600
Lay our hands down and let your friends feast. Hold them now because I'll take you over this

395
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:44,160
down tonight on my magic cup until all I'm done. I'll take you away from the rising light.

396
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:29,440
Oh, she said, she'll never do so. She'll better feel, that I'll swear on the dream.

397
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:43,440
I've been in a scene like red, we played, I didn't see. And she said, yeah, just close your eyes.

398
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:56,160
Lay our hands down and let your friends feast. Hold them now because I'll take you over this

399
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:12,800
down tonight on my magic cup until all I'm done. I'll take you away from the rising light.

400
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:22,800
Oh, she said, yeah, just close your eyes.

401
00:42:42,800 --> 00:43:04,800
Oh, she said, yeah, just close your eyes. Lay our hands down and let your friends feast.

402
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:22,800
Take over now and I'll take you over this down tonight on my magic cup until all I'm done.

403
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:45,920
Take you over this rising light. Take you over now and I'll take you over this down tonight on my magic

404
00:43:45,920 --> 00:44:05,920
cup until all I'm done. I'll take you away from the rising light. This is you never left me before.

405
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:33,920
The magic carpet by new leaf from Sweden, it's all good, as you see would say.

406
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:41,920
All right, everybody, that's it for today's source code. So tomorrow, apparently the lady Patricia will be on

407
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:48,720
remember to send her emails, okay? Adam at curie.com or adamantpodshow.com if you really want your email to get there and bypass all the spam

408
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,920
crap and daily source code.com for all your comments. Talk to you tomorrow, everybody. Bye bye.
