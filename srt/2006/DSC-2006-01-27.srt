00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Delta Sierra Charlie 3-2-5

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The first time I've ever seen a Delta Sierra Charlie heading forward the highway, looking forward to the entryway, and what if it comes up on safe?

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's not a big Friday, it's not a big Friday, it's not a big Friday, it's not a big Friday, yeah.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
One is, as I say, while it is a methane high, the drink too much coffee and a foreign gas tank.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
When you're lovin' McDonald's right doing sound filler, to a 16 gallons of flammable waste throughout my ass.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In the destruction of the music industry in my ears, I like to think I'm a greasing up the future.

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm just in this old curry.

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh yeah, hello everybody, it is Friday, this is not a repeat of last week's show.

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You're not playing the same dance on the film.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
How do you not want to start the weekend off with some cowbells?

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Why don't I sing one, four, three, yeah?

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Try to rock while penting, yeah!

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I hit my paws in the patio, my arms got so pissed off!

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Making plans aboard in the camp, we go!

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Came to have me facing enemies on the knees of challenges!

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,500
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

20
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You can't hear me, you go grow up

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You can't hear me, you can't hear me

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You don't want to down, want to down, want to down, want to down

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
See my arms, you feel the wind falls free

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I play when I feel it all

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I get into the body, feel your fear

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I want to let's party, feel all the time

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
See, see, see, see

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This boss calls over and over

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Take the staff out of each other

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't get used to it

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You don't want to be needed

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And not away, don't kind of take the money

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You want to take them all

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh, I wanna those things

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'll go home

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Oh, yeah

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:55,440
On and on!

59
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:04,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, reamo爷爷爷Ea gyzo!

60
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:31,420
Stingray 143 from the podcast music network music.podshow.com, it's Friday everybody, how

61
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:38,140
you're doing, how you feeling. I'm feeling pretty good. We were up real early this morning. Lots

62
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:43,660
of girls to move around the planet today. Patricia, off to see her sister for the weekend. As

63
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:51,740
you know, the SESNA 182 RG is completely dismantled engines out, interior out, everything's

64
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:58,940
getting refurbished, rejuvenated. And oh, yes, the youth will come back to the 182 RG. So my boy's

65
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:04,700
Nick and Roy picked her up in the mooney, which is a very different type of aircraft. And I

66
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,700
preface this to Patricia. I said, you know, you kind of got to walk over the wing to get in.

67
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,620
She's like, oh, well, I'll have to wear the proper shoes. It was amazing, though, where I gave

68
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:22,620
this beautiful leopard skin suitcase set for Christmas. And she took what I thought was a rather

69
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,300
large suitcase, because, you know, just remembering the moonium, like, man, I don't know. You wanted

70
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,020
to put that thing. There might be your fellow passenger. How do you hear all that? Is that his or

71
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,580
hum or what am I hearing here? I've got, I don't know. I got to look at this shit here. Anyway,

72
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,820
so she was off, off in a way. She's already landed sent me a text message. Everything's okay.

73
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:48,060
Okay, Christina's at school. And of course, I'm taking her and Owen to the garage in London.

74
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:54,300
Turns out it's North London, which is like an hour and a half drive. It would be very interesting to see

75
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:01,980
because they're going to the panic at the disco gig tonight. And big surprise. Now, I hadn't

76
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,300
mentioned this on the show, but Casplaster, Mike and I got into a fabulous row. I mean, we got

77
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,580
like into a flame war that flamed out on email. It was pretty interesting. You know, basically,

78
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,420
fuck you, fuck you. No fuck you. And then that was the end of it for a day or two. And Mike

79
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,500
came with a wonderful piece offering today. I don't know if it was intended that way, but I certainly

80
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:29,820
take it that way. He sent me a special pod father edition of Casplaster, which is just fantastic.

81
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,740
If anything, I've been bitching about not having enough players because I've so many different

82
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,580
pieces of audio feedback and stuff that I want to line up that, you know, I'd wind up using

83
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,620
external quick time players and stuff. And so now you fired up, but actually says Casplaster, the pod

84
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:48,940
felt the pod father edition. Instead of the 10 jingle cart machines that are mapped to the

85
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,140
function keys, I have 12. And of course, you have 12 function keys, so it fits perfectly. And now

86
00:07:54,140 --> 00:08:05,020
I can actually have space left over for, oh, you know, stuff like, you know, that or a fantastic.

87
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:13,420
And I have 24 players for tracks. Thank you, Mike. This is exactly what I needed. I'm so happy.

88
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,860
And now, um, I guarantee you it's going to be an extra super long show because we've got all kinds

89
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:25,980
of feedback from all of my favorite people. Like I said, G&B was some feedback on TSC number 324.

90
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:33,580
So about this whole split thing, um, the car's native was definitely right. Um, artists have

91
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:39,660
traditionally made pennies on the dollar with music. And in fact, we still do, um, love spirals

92
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,700
and sign up with just about every one of those digital music stores out. They're all the majors,

93
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:51,260
iTunes, rap, city music, net, MSN, music, Napster, Sony, Connect, Yadayada, Yadayada. And the amount

94
00:08:51,260 --> 00:09:00,060
that we make ranges from two cents to 86 cents. Um, there's, there's no standards. So, um, you know,

95
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:05,260
but we're happy to get whatever we do because, you know, if you normally make a dollar something

96
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:13,020
per CD, making two cents to 86 cents per song is actually pretty awesome. So I think, um, people should

97
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:20,220
chill out and not be split and hairs on how much money they're going to be making from the PMM downloads

98
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:27,020
because it's all good. Isn't it? It's all good. By the way, I'd like to thank all the podcasters out there

99
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,980
for their support of love spirals on the positive music network. And for reading our tracks,

100
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:38,860
so I think, thanks so much. Appreciate it. NGB, I love it when you send voice feedback to me. I love

101
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:45,100
it so much. Yeah. Um, so lots of feedback on that slouch, checked in. Um, yeah, he kind of said the

102
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,940
same thing. I think, uh, and again, we're not focusing on this too much, but I'm pretty sure that,

103
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,740
um, sales through PMM and depending on how, uh, you know, if a podcasters involved in the middle of

104
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:02,380
they want to take, uh, a fee. Oh, my left foot is itching on or if they want to, you know, of course,

105
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:07,420
you don't have to. You'll be able to give the fee right back to the artist. Anyway, between 50 and 65

106
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,460
cents, probably sounds about right. You know, universally across the board, I think, just the transaction

107
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:17,980
fee on the 99 cents song is about nine cents, so maybe 10 cents, nine or 10 cents. That's kind of

108
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:23,900
something you can't get away from a regardless. So, um, apologies that we're, that we're still not

109
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:30,780
in the public beta testing of this. Uh, we've got, uh, Dan and, uh, we got to Dan a man and Jersey Joe

110
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:36,220
working on the code, tightening it all up. Um, and thanks, of course, uh, to everyone who was sent in

111
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:41,900
comments about, uh, you know, certain, um, things that can be approved on the Pods of Music Network,

112
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,660
some security enhancements, all this stuff is, is extremely appreciated. And, of course,

113
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,820
is being passed right onto a Chris Rockwell and Dan and, uh, and Joe and all the boys and girls

114
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,780
who are working very hard. As I said, um, 24 tracks to play things didn't fill them all up,

115
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:03,100
but I came pretty damn close. Hello, Adam. My name is Ed hidden with the ed hidden dot com photocast

116
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:09,980
and the I co host the late source podcast available at studio lighting.net. And those are

117
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,220
two podcasts for photographers out there who want to, you know, they're more about lighting or

118
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:20,220
find out things that I do with photography and hopefully you can learn from my mistakes or my experiences.

119
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:26,860
But today, I have a question about enhanced podcast for you. Now, the photocast is enhanced podcast,

120
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:33,020
but I'm a PC user. So I had to con one of my mac friends into actually assembling all of the pieces

121
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:40,780
for me. But I purchased QuickTime Pro and examined the file properties from an enhanced podcast created

122
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:50,060
with the chapter tool and kind of my AAC file that I made in QuickTime Pro and I tried to match

123
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:55,500
up the properties as much as I could and seemed like it was outputting the exact same format as

124
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:02,060
the chapter tool was. I played the same in QuickTime as as an enhanced podcast does. However, when I

125
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:09,500
exported out to QuickTime or iTunes, it just kind of behaves like a normal audio file. No images,

126
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:15,340
no links, no anything. So I'm, I'm stumped. I've tried QuickTime or tried Apple. I've tried their

127
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:22,380
forms. Nothing's happening. And there's no announcement or anything whether anything's going to

128
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:28,940
ever come about with a chapter tool version for the PC and I'm very frustrated and I'm kind of at

129
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:35,180
my last draw. So I'm asking the pod father. Challenging your listeners out there because I know

130
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,300
you got some bright brains out there in the audience. So let's see what we can do. I look forward to hearing

131
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,620
your response and thank you for everything you do for the podcast community. Take care. Bye bye.

132
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:51,180
So this is very interesting. I believe Cas Blaster Mike actually had some kind of windows thing

133
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:58,380
that was doing that. I think he was, he was looking way deep into those files to see what was possible.

134
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:03,820
And from what I understand, it is very possible to do that with a windows application. It's an

135
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:10,380
open format as far as I know. But this is kind of interesting. It is kind of the way Apple does things.

136
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:15,660
I don't even think that the tool that's out there now that's being used widely. I think I got

137
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,300
it from versiontracker.com. I don't even think that was an Apple product or seeded by Apple.

138
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:26,540
They do seem to kind of have that mantra. So seems like there's a perfect application for

139
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:32,780
developer who wants to make some money, shareware version or version that has a trial period and then

140
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:38,780
you're typical 1995. Whatever it is for that software had by that stuff all the time. Particularly

141
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:45,580
the 1995 stuff. I have so many applications that I've used that have come from independent software

142
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:52,380
vendors as they call them. Or usually a guy with a big fucking sense. Sorry. A big fricking senseo.

143
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:00,700
And lots of hours at night to work on cool stuff that people really want. We did make by the way.

144
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:07,260
And I'll just say we the community of power book owners who are definitely disappointed by the

145
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:15,980
lack of response on Apple's part regarding this loop sound looping issue. We made the consumerist.com.

146
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,860
And I got some angry emails too. People saying, hey, Apple responded, it's shut up already.

147
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,020
Well, the thing is they didn't really. They didn't say, we'll go back to you. If we find anything

148
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:32,620
now, the only line that was listed on the tech document that also says the way to solve this

149
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:37,980
is to only use one audio application at a time. The only extra line they say and there is,

150
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,540
you know, watch this page if information becomes available. It didn't say like, we're working

151
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:48,700
on an hard behind the scenes guys. Why don't make y'all happy? Never mind. Casplastic is doing just fine

152
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,020
for me right now. Thank you very much. Hi, Adam and everyone out there in DSC Nation. This is

Hi, I'm Mary and I'm Parallel from the Mary and Parallel show. Adam, we are pleased to

165
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,620
announce and very excited that we have joined the pod show family. We are safe to be part of an

166
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,100
amazingly talented group of diverse podcasts. We also want to bring a little girl part of the

167
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,580
network along with the fantastic females like the bitties, the mummies, and of course,

168
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,380
and just because we're joining the most powerful podcast network in the business,

169
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,380
we'll still remain the same girls we've always been. We'll click lobster, we'll take road trips,

170
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:37,020
we'll argue, we'll discuss guys, we'll visit the market, we'll argue, we'll go to the post office,

171
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,740
we'll play around on our Mac, and we'll also argue, and we wouldn't have it any other way.

172
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,900
If you've never heard of the show, check out our video podcast. We're up to 30 episodes and are

173
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,540
going to be bigger and battered in 2006. Hey, and maybe we'll get you a sense of what

174
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,700
I find. Now that we're all in the network. That's my front door, Carla.

175
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,580
And then I'll listen to the nurse get her a black fine. No. And again, Adam, we're super

176
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:04,940
excited to join the pod show and don't forget we love you Adam. Bye.

177
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:12,220
I love you two girls. And welcome to the pod show family. Great to have more of

178
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:18,860
they also do a video podcast of the show, which is at first glance, you might think

179
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:24,060
unbelievably boring with one static shot, but you kind of get sucked into it and then throw

180
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:29,900
them out of it. Like, can't help it. And the girls don't forget, by the way, we have more women

181
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:37,020
on the pod show podcast network. I had the run, John L, who are sponsored by iKview,

182
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:43,820
download.acview.com. Yes, you mentioned magic course, and then there's all of the queue potters,

183
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:50,300
some of the women, some undefined, but all all great shows were happy to have them aboard.

184
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:56,860
Dawn from Dawn Drew. You know, let's go on and on. I think it's actually I love it. You know,

185
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,580
I think that there's many more women in pod casting than we're seeing women in broadcasting.

186
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,420
At least that's my my personal experience. Great to have you guys aboard.

187
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:12,300
Hey, it's Friday. So that means we've got tons of stuff to do. And wow, what would a Friday be without

188
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:19,020
a bit of Trinity? Unless be honest. You can humbers sing along, if you wish.

189
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,220
Just three short ones today. Of course, I don't have Trinity here with me. She's sitting comfy

190
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:42,060
and snug in the garage at the Curry condo. So, um, but there is some stuff happening over here

191
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:46,460
as a Mark Waymouth email me at him on the local BBC news in the Midlands. There was a clipping

192
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,100
which ties in with the attached article and hyperlink about the first garage in the UK to offer

193
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,820
100% biodiesel. Sounds like you should get up there for the English angle on things,

194
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:00,060
which is bound to be a little more basic than anything in California. And it's a link from

195
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:07,180
positive news.org.uk article number 45. I'll make sure a link shows up in the show notes. Thanks, Mark.

196
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,660
Yeah, I think this thing is really taken off. In fact, I was watching a best of top gear

197
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:21,020
yesterday. And they raised a mini, a new mini versus a scoda diesel and the scoda beat the

198
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,620
pants off the mini. Even though the audience thought that the mini would win. And of course,

199
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,580
the scoda was a diesel. And the reason why scoda is making diesels because they say it is the

200
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:35,260
future of automobile engines. And I think I have to concur. I believe we'll, you know, just before

201
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,940
we get into the Mad Max situation, we'll all kind of be, you know, pooping in our tanks, using

202
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:47,340
that biodiesel. It'll work. And it smells so wonderful. John Prosser says, Adam,

203
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,740
interesting piece on biodiesel. We'll show him on the BBC Monday, the 16th of January.

204
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:56,780
Why are you in San Francisco? Starts about 10 minutes in. It's inside out chip fat is the

205
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:01,420
title of the feature. It's from the BBC show inside out. I don't know if that's still available

206
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,740
on the BBC website because they do take stuff down after like a week or so. But make

207
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,740
you very much John. It's good to see the stuff is happening in the UK. And David Patrick

208
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,180
says, uh, biodiesel must be going big time. We're starting to get the first backlash about

209
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:23,180
his production. Oh, second. I think I have to go look at the link here. Well prepared, Curry. Here

210
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:28,220
we go. It's a BBC link. Biofuel raises global dilemmas. The massive depots and west six

211
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,500
grains sprawling processing plant and henstredger filling to the brim, not only with locally

212
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:39,580
grown wheat, but also with hope for a more environmentally friendly future. Uh, but people are

213
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:46,060
pitching and moaning about having those things nearby. But you're right. I think backlash

214
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,900
and we're going to see a lot of backlash coming. This is just impossible to think that

215
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:56,060
from a political perspective. People aren't all over the map on this stuff. You know, trying to

216
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,500
protect their their own interests, which is something that can be expected. And we'll just keep

217
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:07,900
on truck and boys and girls as we keep our eye on that fabulous biodiesel industry with Trinity.

218
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:21,500
Yeah, thank you. I don't for being in her take. Trinity. Oh, Trinity. Yeah. Right on.

219
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:29,340
Some feedback from Frank Yonan who has, you know, it's a ball's in my court, Frank. I apologize.

220
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:34,140
Frank really did all the design for the tattoo that I want to get. And Patricia and I just haven't

221
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,380
really found the time to sit down and go over the last couple of bits and send that back to them

222
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,700
for one final revision. We've got everything down. Everything's pretty much done. So I apologize

223
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,900
of just been a bit late. He did weigh in this for this show with a couple other topics. First splits

224
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:53,020
on PMN. I'd like to have something and let's me push artists for free and push our other artists

225
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,460
for a little share. But in the end, it's all about the numbers for me. How much is generated by

226
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,500
what link? Not money, but successful transfers. Number that I can use for other projects, other

227
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:08,940
parts of my site, etc. Not quite sure. Okay, so you want to how many people you've sent

228
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,420
over to an artist's website, perhaps? I think we can do that in a problem there. And yes, it will be

229
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:20,780
entirely possible for a podcast or a listener who helps in selling a track through a link on

230
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:27,980
their show site or a show notes or a link on a listener website or weblog any kind of HTML page,

231
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:32,300
essentially. You'll be able to give that entirely to the artist if you wish. Or maybe we can set up

232
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:42,780
a third category of charities. Just as an example, I don't care. That's fine. Whatever you

233
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:50,060
guys want to do. About learning Gaelic, I can understand a bit of Gaelic, but had a hard time

234
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:56,140
speaking of writing it, uh-huh. Learned it by translating clanid and anyotunes. Interesting.

235
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,900
To arrive from having to paint letters in art school where I did book of Kells Illuminations.

236
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,780
Wow. Why were you translating Enia and clanid lyrics? Interested.

237
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:14,780
And uh, what is this? In case you're too enlist, nah, I don't know what they want to go into that

238
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:20,540
right now. Uh, let me see. We have, uh, we have another audio crew. I have another audio feedback

239
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:24,700
here. Let me see how long is it? It's about a minute 17 and won't make that before the

240
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:30,940
satellite window closes. Okay. Let me tell you then, uh, let me see if there's anything else that

241
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:36,780
we had to talk about. Shoot. Here. I'll grab this one. Hey Adam, I was listening to your show,

242
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:43,260
uh, 323 and I heard someone sent you an email about, um, your show and there's Enmicro.

243
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:48,300
I actually have a Zenmicro and I do use media player. And of course, I listened to your show

244
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:54,620
and I listened to it on my MP3 player. And everything is working fine and, um, I have never had

245
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,580
any trouble with the transfers even with the new shows. So I'm thinking, maybe it's his firmware.

246
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:05,580
I know creative just uh, release new firmware. So that might be a problem. Anyways, thanks. Bye.

247
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:11,740
Yeah, good point. Although, you know, it's, in fact, I was given a Zenmicro, uh, portable MP3 player,

248
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,220
the Zen, something. I forget what it is. By the way, these are the people who invented the Zen

249
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:20,940
cast. And the first thing when the box was given to me was said, oh, you have to go and update the

250
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,740
firmware. I'm like, that is not a good thing. They should really make sure that, you know,

251
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,300
they get all their software stuff rolling and you shouldn't have to, you know, they should package

252
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:35,020
it with something so that happens automatic. Hey, folks, listening to Syria stars 103 Pacifico's

253
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:39,580
Hellways up next, then Madge, then Dawn and Drew and tonight, it's the roadhouse with Tony right

254
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:48,060
here on the pod show. Oh, shoot. There we go. Sorry. I forgot to open up the fader. Actually,

255
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:55,260
I got a feedback on that about that sound. Very interesting. This is from the application

256
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:01,820
countdown clock. Real simple, beautiful, love it. My young says, just FYI, FYI, the sound from that

257
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:07,660
countdown clock program you use is indeed registered to Sony. SOE specifically, that Sony online

258
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:14,060
entertainment. It's the you've just completed a quest sound from their ever quest game.

259
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,380
Keep using it if you wish, but if Sony finds out, I'm sure that give you plenty of copyright

260
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:26,220
hassles. Whoa. Okay. Don't want to do that. And is that absolutely 100% sure? We know that Sony

261
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,700
didn't rip it off from somewhere. Maybe the countdown clock guys can check in with that. They should

262
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:36,700
probably be aware of that. You know what? Since you were so nice to send me a free copy,

263
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,940
if that indeed is something you got from somewhere out there and you want that change because

264
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:45,020
you probably get in trouble. Eventually, if they find out about you distributing this stuff,

265
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,020
let me know. I'll make a new sound for you. Be happy to hook you up with that.

266
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:59,500
Hello Adam, come and buy it. What's in the fall of Portuguese? I heard just speaking a little

267
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,620
Portuguese one of your shows, so this is to test your years. My feedback is about the upcoming podcast

268
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:09,420
deliver network. I really looking forward to that. And you hinted about the partnership,

269
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,820
partnership with LimeLide. From that, I assumed that all the hosts here in the

270
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:18,780
cybersecurity will be done by them. That makes sense. But my question is, have you considered ways

271
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:24,380
to migrate existing RSS feeds into the new network? I currently have my podcast hosted at

272
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:30,140
Potomatic.com and would hate to lose my scars with faithful listeners. I'm a podcast or here in

273
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,860
some follow and if any of your listeners are from Brazil or can understand Portuguese,

274
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,460
and I want to listen some of the best tunes of the Potomatic music network. They're

275
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:46,940
welcome to listen to my show at rickpot.potomatic.com. That's our ICKPOD. The show's important to

276
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:52,140
use since my idea is to promote the bands around here in Brazil, and the podcast scene here is really

277
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:58,060
growing. Without that, maybe I can quit my day job. In the meantime, more cowbell.

278
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:12,700
Yeah, excellent. Good question. Yeah, of course we consider that. Absolutely. We call the

279
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:21,420
feature the feed vacuum. And when you sign up as a podcaster to the with pod show to the podcast

280
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:26,380
delivery network, at least you're given an option to sucking your pre-existing feed. And the

281
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,700
files actually, it'll suck everything over for you. And you can don't have to wait for it and

282
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,020
start sucking and you just keep on a truck and you'll see little status bar up there in the top.

283
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,500
It's pretty cool. Now, let's talk about this for one second, though, because there is something

284
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:47,260
very important to mention. If you want to, of course it will depend on what RSS fee, this is

285
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:52,940
really for podcasters, y'all. What RSS fee do you want to be using? Now, if you use a service like

286
00:27:52,940 --> 00:28:01,420
feed burner, if you use a service like, well, libson or what was the one I've got the one you're

287
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:12,460
using? Okay, whatever one. You know, changing that, it basically needs a technological insert,

288
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:20,380
which we call a redirect. And not all company, I believe libson offers it, you know, so if you

289
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,700
wanted to leave, then, and by the way, they should charge money for it if they don't, they should.

290
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:30,220
If you want to leave, then they can just redirect all requests for your existing feed to the location

291
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:35,020
of your new feed. I'm going to have the exact same issue when I migrate over to the, to the

292
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:41,260
PDN as well, because I've been using a radio user land RSS feed for, well, forever, basically.

293
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:46,700
So, I'm going to have to ask them, the folks at radio user land, if they'll put a redirect on

294
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,980
their server for me, I'm hoping they, they offered it once, I'm hoping that they still will,

295
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:55,420
that'd be very cool. But the real solution to this, and of course, I've messed it up myself.

296
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:01,500
The real solution is to register a domain name and use that domain name and take a little bit of

297
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:07,020
time to understand how it works and what you can do with it, because it really makes moving servers

298
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:11,900
extremely efficient and easy and you don't have to rely on anyone else. Maybe

299
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,300
a system's administrator for your domain name, but if you go to a place like GoDaddy, they make

300
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:22,700
it pretty simple. And in fact, when you sign up to the PDN, you can, you can map an existing domain

301
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:28,220
name to it if you want to buy one. Then we actually have GoDaddy will be integrated directly,

302
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:35,420
so you can, oops. Oh, podpim is going to get angry. So you can map a domain name immediately to

303
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:41,340
to your show site and your RSS feed. And if you want to move and you want to go away,

304
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:45,980
then all you have to do is just point it to a different server. The domain name and the RSS feed

305
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:51,020
know that stuff and those links will all remain intact. That's really critical stuff. And I encourage

306
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:56,220
you to take it. Is there, could someone please send me, there's got to be some kind of how to

307
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:03,740
a really simple, well written document about domain names and just for, you know, for a podcast,

308
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:07,340
you just want to get going, but does want to, you know, be looking out towards the future,

309
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,940
so they can understand what, you know, what you go through. I mean, in fact, I'll even look and see

310
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,260
if GoDaddy has any of that stuff on their site, you would expect to have some, some information

311
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,500
about it. And of course, there's all kinds of services that you can add to it and you can have email

312
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:28,380
at it. So, you know, looking forward to it, I kind of get to Brazil, man. Ron and Marta, I

313
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:32,460
went to Brazil for a new year, so I said it had a really good time. Patricia wants to go to.

314
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,340
Yes, so much to do, so little time.

315
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:47,980
Metro, sexual, metro, sexual, sexual, sexual, sexual, sexual, sexual, it's Adam Curry's Metro,

316
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:56,220
sexual moment. Oh yeah. Adam Curry's Metro, sexual moment. I got to say, I catch myself

317
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:00,700
humming the tune quite a lot these days, which is a little bit disconcerting, but hey, thanks very

318
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:05,020
much everyone who sent in audio feedback for the Metro's sexual moment. Let's get right to it.

319
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:12,060
Hey, Adam, it's Derek Miller from podcast.pandmachine.com. Leave a message for you again.

320
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:16,460
I've got a cold, so I've got a really good radio and answer voice right now. Anyway,

321
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,540
you wanted some audio feedback for the Metro's sexual moment. You've got it. I have three things

322
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:26,300
to talk about. One is electric shabers. I'm an electric shaber user, but we've got our

323
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:31,660
controversies too. I use both the rotary shabers, the three head things like the fillet shave

324
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:37,180
and the brawn foil shaber. Right now I'm using the brawn, but I think I prefer the rotary

325
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:42,380
shaber more. It seems to shave a bit better on my face, and it doesn't seem to drop so many

326
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:49,180
little fragments of hair all over the place. Second is facial cleanser. I really like the stuff

327
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:53,340
with the little microbeats, and I've got some sort of generic brand right now that's got like an

328
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:59,740
orange scent. Really nice. Good stuff. You should use it as well as moisturizer. Finally,

329
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:04,380
this you'll like to know about. Here in Vancouver in Canada, there's a place called the

330
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:09,740
absolute spa. They've got a few locations, but the hotel Vancouver downtown, they've got a men's

331
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:15,980
only spa, and it's got PlayStation while you're getting your pedicure done. Now how good is that?

332
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:21,580
No, I also haven't been there yet, but I think I'll go. Anyway, that's my Metro Central Audio

333
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:28,620
Feedback for now. I'm at podcast.pinmachine.com. I've got an out of love. I've got a podcast with

334
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:32,940
free songs. I'm on the podcast using network. Right now, I've got this great radio and that's

335
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:39,180
a voice I wish I had to keep it without having the cold. Talk to you later. I do. You know what?

336
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,860
If you're in San Francisco, I'd give you my parking spot while I'm away. Thank you very much.

337
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:49,660
Yeah, you know, I worked at an electronic store when I was 15 on Saturdays, and I worked at the

338
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:54,620
same, well right next to the counter I was at, and I was selling like everything from cassette tapes to

339
00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:02,380
resistors, capacitors, transistors, even some chips. Right next to me was the, you know, the department

340
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:07,660
that does electric gear, like mixers and vacuum cleaners and shavers, but sometimes they come over to my

341
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,500
counter, and this is the nasties thing, because their shavers wouldn't be working anymore,

342
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,620
and then they'd come up and they'd have one of those foil shavers, and they'd pull it out of

343
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,620
their pocket, and they'd be like, oh look, my shavers, we're going to be more, and they'd plop

344
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:25,580
open the top right there, and all the hair would come out and just cover my entire counter.

345
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:32,140
It was the most disgusting thing. So I really got tuned into it, when someone started pulling

346
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:35,500
that electric razor, their pocket would be like, stop right there, whatever you're doing,

347
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:40,220
you have to be the next counter, please, sir. Yeah, electric doesn't work very well for me.

348
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:45,420
I've gotten pretty accustomed to the G3 power raise, and I must say it's, it's feeling pretty good.

349
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,460
I have bought my first replacement blade and cannot tell any difference between the original

350
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:57,180
it came with yet, certainly not visual, but I've only done one pass, so I'll keep my eye on it.

351
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:01,980
The other one lasted for what? A good three weeks, so stay tuned for more on that.

352
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:09,100
Hi Adam, this is Doc from all critters.potshow.com, and I just wanted to let you know that

353
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:13,820
I'm one of those kind of guys there, very lucky, because I got a wife that loves that three

354
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:19,260
day growth look, and that's how I've had it. Never go on a shave it up, because I think she'll

355
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:25,420
kill me if I do. So anyway, I like that, a trim up the edges, just a regular bit razor, and you know,

356
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:30,860
turn around dry shave. Usually you don't put anything on, jumping this quick shower, and hurry

357
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:36,060
up and get nice and land it up, close those pores up, and it usually works out quite nicely for me,

358
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:42,300
so. That's what I use, nothing too fancy, nothing too special. Tried the wall, I liked it,

359
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:48,140
but I got a new one, and it's called the peanut, and the peanut is absolutely cool. Everybody's

360
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:53,180
got to go take a look, because this is absolutely the neatest little electric razor you can get.

361
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:57,900
It's got the little attachment that makes it so that you can go ahead and shave down really

362
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:03,420
super close, and keep that three day look. I mean, it's just great. I love it. Robin loves it.

363
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:08,620
I love it. But can we say, you got to make them all happy. Doing a great job with the daily source

364
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:13,180
code? Hope to talk to you soon. All right, dude, make sure you send me a link. Maybe you did. I didn't

365
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:18,460
catch them. Send me a link next time. The peanut is that what you said? So many devices that we have to

366
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,980
check out on this show. If in case you didn't know, the Metro sexual moment is where we all kind of

367
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:28,700
hang out and talk about, you know, men's beauty in moisturizing and shaving, like that.

368
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:35,180
Nick Zypler says, heard on the DSC323 that you wanted to work with deal with Gillette to get a

369
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,540
free mock three power to all of your listeners. Did you ever think about trying to work with

370
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:44,220
deal to get those of us who have already purchased one free blades? Just an idea. Thanks for the

371
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:50,140
great show. Well, that may actually be tougher than you think, because that is the bread and butter,

372
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:55,260
you know, they want to give away a shaver with one razor and one battery to get people completely hooked.

373
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:00,300
You're already hooked. But I of course I'll try. You know, I'll try. Shoot.

374
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:06,460
Hey, Adam, it's KFC. From the potchick show, and I have a Metro sexual moment for you.

375
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:13,980
My husband, Mr. Flows, sometimes, had not had a pedicure. Oh, wait, no, I think you had one

376
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:20,380
pedicure a couple of years ago. But anyway, so I'm getting this pedicure across from my age

377
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:25,100
office. And they've got this really amazing chair. A lot of pedicure places, ladies, you know,

378
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:30,700
have the vibration chairs. Well, this one was just home and God. It was better than any other one

379
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:35,340
that I'd set it for. So I'm like, okay, that's it Saturday. Next week, I'm going to bring my husband

380
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:39,900
here. I'm going to get pedicures together. It's sitting these like total massage chairs. You know,

381
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,740
just for a treat for each other, because we don't do shit like that much. And hey, my show is all

382
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:49,500
about positive. I've been this was very good for that. So he got a pedicure and he faced a

383
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:54,780
defeat in the little bubbly tub and they rub. Just so you know, guys or even girls, if you haven't

384
00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:01,340
had one, it's amazing. Usually they're under $20 to last. And most times, you can just like walk into

385
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:06,540
a nail place and get them. But guys, more and more men are doing this. I was talking about that

386
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,980
and they were saying, oh, for sure, that lots more men are coming in. So Dan gets this pedicure

387
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:17,020
and they rub his legs and use all this mint and exfoliate and do your nails, all this stuff.

388
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:22,460
And then at the very end, like, come. I said, hey, why don't you get them? Get them wax. He's like,

389
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:30,700
no way, man, that sounds painful. I'm like, no. Paraphine wax, man. Paraphine wax, your feet, guys.

390
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:37,100
Oh, he was just like, oh, my God. What they do is they grease up your feet and then they stick

391
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:43,740
them in this like hot wax. But it's not hot. Like, oh, he hot. It's hot, like, ooh, that's

392
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,380
kind of hot. And so you dip your feet in there and then they pull them out and they dip them again

393
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,900
and they pull them out into mint again and they pull them out and then they wrap them in plastic bags

394
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:58,060
and you sit and they, and they kind of like, they're like little sauna bags around your toes.

395
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:03,980
Yeah. And then after, I don't know, like, five or ten minutes, they, um, I was listening to

396
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:10,780
the Don and Drew show while we were doing it. It was perfect. Anyway, so they, um, massage the bags

397
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:20,220
on the wax and everything on your feet and they're just so soft and silky and, um, um, I found it

398
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:28,220
very hot and Mr. Prossi liked it too. So there you go. For your mental section moment and

399
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:37,820
your mental section moment. Yeah. I was ready to tune there. I can't see. Thank you. Appreciate it.

400
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:44,780
Man, it's just just tiring all that metro sexual moments stuff. And I can just hear Chris Rockwell

401
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:50,780
yelling and saying that I'm turning them men into pussies. No way, dude. You got to try this stuff.

402
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:56,060
Yeah, I like drinking beer and farting and watching football. Of course I like that. But

403
00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:00,380
paraphernal wax on your feet, my friend. No, no, no, that is something you really must try.

404
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,540
Yeah, um, I'm part of a close class trying to make a difference at a local hospital.

405
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,420
I'm living in the northeast of Ireland. And in the last four years, we've had three A&E

406
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:15,100
departments closed in and one hospital almost completely closed due to lack of equipment and

407
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:20,300
staff shortages. We're working on a method of enhancing some of the older equipment, like

408
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:26,540
Harry Potter, Harry Potter machines, through modified airport express. So doctors, nurses,

409
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,500
nurse stations can mar her their patients, even while they're in their offices and other

410
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:37,740
parts of the hospital. So let's say I'm a patient. This allows my doctor to check only,

411
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:44,540
then go to the A&E patients during the x-ray and still have my vitals on a screen with them all the time.

412
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:52,300
We're working on software for palm, windows mobile and tablet PC. And because I've really

413
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:57,420
found the java, we're going to be running a confibrillator type widget in the corner of the tablet.

414
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:03,100
So the doctor can always see my vitals. It's kind of like a system widget showing CPU usage and

415
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:08,460
RAM usage in the corner of the screen, but it'll show hardware and that kind of thing.

416
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:15,900
Essentially, I don't know, I'm sending this to you as we need some help. We don't have any equipment

417
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:21,180
to test this on. We've really grateful if anyone could help us. We're looking for a tablet PC,

418
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,420
a few palm-based devices and a couple of windows mobile devices.

419
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:33,260
And even at other, they can help contact me at tom.landi, l, a, n, d, y at gmail.com.

420
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:42,140
Thanks very much for your time. So I've actually exchanged some email with Tom over the past

421
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:47,100
couple of days about this. And it's a pretty cool project. They really are trying to do this

422
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:54,700
on the spot, on location, getting the stuff implemented. And trying to make a difference in

423
00:40:54,700 --> 00:41:02,940
health care, dudes, I'm all for it. And I have my craplet here, which is it's just that mind you.

424
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:07,180
It's a craplet, but it works pretty good, except for the the sound card is shit.

425
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:13,100
And the battery is, you know, the battery doesn't hold the charge much longer than 10 minutes.

426
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:18,300
Be happy to send it to you for the good cause. If you promise to keep me up to speed on, you know,

427
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:22,540
send me an audio feedback from time to time. Just let me know how things are going. Let me know

428
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:27,260
how the apps are going. And anyone else, you should send me a link to a website. Oh,

429
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:32,300
I guess you sent you, you mentioned to email. If anyone has any mobile devices, I mean,

430
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,700
you know, this is what happens. And you start casting shit away. And it's just laying here in the corner.

431
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:42,300
So be happy to send it to you. Absolutely. On its way, send me an address. And you know,

432
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:48,460
you'll have to figure out the battery thing cause you'll be very disappointed with the mobility of the

433
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:53,660
craplet as it is cause you really have to stay tethered to the wall. So yeah, let me just

434
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:00,620
reinstall XP and wipe everything off and clean all my shit out. No, I'll send it to you. Absolutely.

435
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:06,620
Thomas Vincent, sent it to email. Love bill. Then we played bill sound scientists. It was very

436
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:10,220
happy about the free download of the new album. I was even more pleased when I looked at their

437
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:14,220
schedule. So they will be in my town Friday night, expect an audio review of the show and perhaps

438
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:19,580
live sound seeing of the concert next week. Looking forward to it, Thomas. Those guys are good. Well,

439
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:25,020
that guy is good, I should say. Really like Bill a lot. Hey, we're getting through it.

440
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,140
Couple more audio comments will be done and we can get started with the weekend.

441
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:33,980
Hey, Adam. This is Matt Dutillo from the Matt's today in history podcast at Matt's today in

442
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:43,580
history.com. I just listened to DSC322 and you were talking about celebrity and the Corey from sports

443
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:51,900
talks.com. Got the ball rolling with that. And I had mentioned this in my blog just a few days ago

444
00:42:52,700 --> 00:43:00,540
where I think what's going to happen with celebrity and podcasting is that most podcasters,

445
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:07,340
guys like myself are probably always going to work our day jobs and we'll have listenerships

446
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:15,500
in the hundreds or low thousands. And we will be well known to those people that tiny little

447
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:25,020
niche that we serve. And I think this is going to happen not only with podcasting, but with other

448
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:32,940
forms of media as well in music, you know, maybe indie movies. I think that the group of people that

449
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:40,540
are, you know, quote unquote Hollywood famous is going to become smaller and smaller as our

450
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:46,460
entertainment options become more diversified. I'd be interested to get your thoughts on this.

451
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:53,420
Anyway, great show. Thank you for what you've done for podcasting and have a great one.

452
00:43:53,420 --> 00:44:01,740
Yeah, Matt. Thank you. Good weekend to you as well. Yeah. I think you're right. I don't think we'll see

453
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:07,980
another Howard Stern appear in any form of media. We'll probably see let's just take audio podcasting

454
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:12,860
as an example. We'll see thousands of Howard Sterns with, you know, somewhere the hundreds,

455
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:18,620
some of the thousands, some maybe with 10,000 listeners. And that'll be a really

456
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:28,060
interesting group of people both by individual show, by individuals and an aggregate.

457
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:34,380
And I think, and we've talked about this a lot, the relationship between the podcaster,

458
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:40,300
the producer of the podcast, and the audience is something very special, not to be devalued down

459
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:50,140
to an advertising CPM, you know, cost per thousand impressions. I think that's, you know,

460
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:54,860
the whole idea of selling stuff solely, certainly solely based on CPM. I think it's really

461
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:59,100
selling a lot of this short because look at what's happening. Look at what's what's going on

462
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:03,100
with commercial messages. Look at this podcast. Look at what's happening with the eye dog. It's such

463
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:10,380
a beautiful example. Yesterday I played that song. My music, myself, and my eye dog. Something like that.

464
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:16,780
I love that a lot. So I think that you're absolutely right. That is what's going to happen.

465
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:21,500
And it'll be fun to watch and fun to be a part of and fun to jump around and fun to listen to

466
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:26,940
the different shows and different shows even in the same genre. It's going to be cool. Really will be.

467
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:32,940
And Nicole says hi out. I'm there about three or four podcasts in the Irish language. Those

468
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:38,940
of us who speak the language call it Irish. Scott's gaelic is gaelic. The pod father of Irish

469
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:44,220
language podcasting is named Khan Charlie Oscar November November. He's been podcasting for quite a

470
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:50,300
few months. I'm Neil. That's india mic echo alpha lima lima dot blugsbark dot com.

471
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:57,420
So I guess I should check that out. I should have played a piece of that. I was stupid in my.

472
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:02,700
Okay. I'll get that set up for the next time Patricia makes a disparaging remark about gaelic language.

473
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:10,620

481
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:04,380
Well hello Adam what's shaking this is Brad from Boston Masterchusets finally home of the

482
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:13,500
world champion Boston Red Sox. I'm coming to today January 26th 2006 raw unscripted unreherst

483
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:18,780
unproduced without a lead in or any music. In fact I don't know what the hell I'm doing

484
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:24,300
but I'm having a blast. I'm new to podcasting and this is my very first experience recording.

485
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:29,340
So I'm really flying by the seat of my pants. I figured out how to record a vocal track

486
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:34,700
using garage band on my power book G4. So I hope it is of the format and quality

487
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:40,060
at best acceptable to you and your listeners. I've been listening to Delta Sierra Charlie

488
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:46,060
for about six months now and really enjoy your show. I especially dig the podcast format.

489
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:51,980
I'm a fan of the talk radio and an even bigger fan of the Tibo revolution and for me

490
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:58,220
podcasting has really had a sweet spot. I get a kick out of all your aviation references

491
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:05,900
during your show because I'm a professional pilot. I fly for a company called netchets www.netchets.com

492
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:12,860
is a private fractional jet ownership company and I fly the sessness citation 10 business jet

493
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:17,420
a real speedster and a lot of fun to fly. I was wondering if you had had any experience

494
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:23,580
soaring or flying gliders. I started flying gliders a few years ago as a hobby and highly recommended.

495
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:28,780
As a flight instructor I find it an exceptional way to develop stick and rudder skills

496
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:34,940
and it is a phenomenal way to share flying with friends and family. Let me know if you have any

497
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:39,580
questions about flying gliders. I'd be happy to talk to you about it. Before I sign off,

498
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:44,940
I had a few questions for you though. First, do you have any tips, references or resources

499
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:51,340
for new podcasts and listeners alike looking to get more involved? I'd really appreciate it.

500
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:57,660
And second, during Delta Sierra Charlie 317 you promote a band called the Butterfly

501
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:07,420
Catchers. I really dig their sound and have tried to find their music on various websites whether

502
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:13,500
be their own or through the pod show network where I could buy their music free and clear

503
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:20,300
but I've had no success. I would really like to get a hold of their album and listen to it further

504
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:28,380
and short of waiting for the podcast network and pod safe music which you guys are working on to

505
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:33,980
kick into full gear. Do you have any recommendations where I could go to get a hold of some

506
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:40,380
their music? Thanks for introducing me to podcast and I'm looking forward to all that the

507
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:47,100
pod show network has to offer. See it. All right, dude. Well, let's go in reverse chronological order

508
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:51,420
then shall we? You definitely can find the Butterfly Catchers at the pod safe music network that's

509
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:57,740
music.podshow.com. Any good place is to start if you want to get into pod casting. I would

510
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:04,460
suggest going to podcastally.com and if you're a listener, I suggest of course going to podshow.com.

511
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:08,140
Of course I'm going to suggest that. Don't get all huffie now.

512
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:16,940
And about the net jets thing, dude, that is very cool. I've actually been considering for quite a while now

513
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:24,620
purchasing 25 hours for net jets Europe because, you know, sometimes it's just, you know,

514
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:29,100
you want to make sure you can get out of an airfield, IFR and all that stuff and maybe want to go

515
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:33,100
a little bit further than just the Netherlands. And so I thought maybe 25 hours would be

516
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:39,900
would be reasonable to just try it out. So yeah, I love the concept. In fact, I started a

517
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:44,780
fractional helicopter company based on the net jets concept. Of course my mistake was trying to set

518
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:51,500
that up in the Netherlands where they don't want you to do anything in the air. So that was quite

519
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:57,660
an interesting journey. And congratulations on your first recording. Good deal. Okay, two more things

520
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:01,660
in the amount of here. The first one is very interesting. Speaking of the Netherlands,

521
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:08,220
there's a chain of very cheap clothing stores, which is called Z-Mum.

522
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:14,780
And I guess here, and I think that I've more than just closed, but in the states, we would say

523
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:20,140
K-Mart. And in the UK, maybe Woolworth, I don't know, something like that. But you know,

524
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:26,140
really cheap-ass shit, bad lighting. And they have now decided that they are no longer

525
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:34,220
going to play music in their stores because they find the Dutch Buma Stemera, which is Ask Abbey

526
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:41,020
Am I equivalent, more or less? Their fees to be too outrageous had cost them 50 to 60,000 euros a

527
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:49,660
year across all their stores. And this actually seems to be a trend of stores and other public

528
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:55,340
places who basically are paying. And they use the radio, which I think is pretty amazing because

529
00:51:55,340 --> 00:52:00,460
the radio, of course, already pays once for the song. And then because they're technically

530
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:06,940
re-broadcasting the radio by having speakers on in a public place, they have to pay once again.

531
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:16,460
That's crazy. Now, I'm hearing noise about other, actually, restaurants and bars

532
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:21,660
who want to go completely pod safe. This is a fantastic fucking development.

533
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:28,140
Although I say good luck. Let's see if the authorities let you get away with it. I believe that

534
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:35,020
they will say, you know, there's just to assure that there's no risk of you playing or playing songs

535
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:38,620
and music that are licensed through us, you're going to have to pay something anyway. I would not be

536
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:46,940
surprised if that is enforced. And it's compulsory. And instead of, you know, well, it may not

537
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:51,260
turn out that way. But if it does, you know, then I definitely think this is something we should

538
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:58,540
dive into because the concept of pod safe bars, pod safe restaurants. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm seeing

539
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:08,220
this go very, very far. And finally, I am Marpezia from MarpeziaNow.com. I've attached my new

540
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:14,780
single double-fisted. I hope you like it. I heard a rumor that you can't find good rap music. Well,

541
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:20,540
if you don't like my song. Oh, well, play it anyway. Ha, ha, ha. Please take a listen to my show, too.

542
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:25,740
I play all kinds of great independent rap artists. Ha, ha, ha. You will probably never get this.

543
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:35,260
Talk to you later, Marpezia aka six foota. Well, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

544
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,060
Not safe for young years.

545
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:55,980
And I don't like to roll with you, man. He's eye cake's one Carlos and up chicks. Only

546
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:03,180
behind me, she's make a moth cliques. We get prom pics, adoptings. We know nice and free drinks.

547
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:09,900
Where VIP would you think? When I in the club, everybody should be in love. Everybody want to hug.

548
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:15,180
And I get down into a resort. I get a little pussy. They ain't a week's bumping.

549
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:20,220
And the wait just don't hear me. So when I hear it, I though I'd do up. I know what Martin is

550
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:25,820
going to hook my ass up. And it begins with ha, ha. Marpezia's double face did.

551
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:31,260
Rolled, rolled, rolled equals, and double face did. The whole table is

552
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:37,100
getting twisted. I just get it true. But some say it was not just a word.

553
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:41,660
Rolled, rolled, and rolled equals, and double face did. The whole table is

554
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:47,660
getting twisted. I just get it true. But some say it was not just a word.

555
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:52,140
And I keep penny on ice. I like it corrode it in my right.

556
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:57,100
Felicity is supply and drinks. All night the dark liquor makes me want to fly.

557
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:02,780
Cause I'm doing a try to take advantage of this time sexy savage.

558
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:08,380
Just as I see that my hands ain't free, but I'll still do damage best believe.

559
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:12,220
So we're to the wise, a grab about the thousand when you're talking to me.

560
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:16,940
We're looking into my eyes cause I'm six, two, eight shit. She could do our Marpezia

561
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:24,060
hook thought to new. So if you want to keep me nice, order me a drink and make it twice.

562
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:29,260
Rolled, rolled, rolled equals, and double face did. The whole table is getting twisted.

563
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:34,060
I just get it true. But some say it was not just a word.

564
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:40,940
Rolled, rolled equals, and double face did. The whole table is getting twisted. I just get it true.

565
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:44,700
But some say it was not just a word.

566
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:48,940
And you need a drink to your left. And one for your right.

567
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:55,020
We gon' get fucked up. If it takes all night, come on.

568
00:55:55,020 --> 00:56:01,740
Rolled, rolled equals, and double face did. The whole table is getting twisted. I just get it true.

569
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:11,820
Rolled, rolled equals, and double face did. The whole table is getting twisted. I just get it true.

570
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:15,820
Rolled, rolled equals, and double face did. The whole table is getting twisted. I just get it true.

571
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:21,340
You gotta have to trust to know what it's about. Marpezia's in a house or beast to make you bounce.

572
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:26,060
Six foot two, it looks long. It's hell. What I do, what I do, what do we wear.

573
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:31,420
Oh, you gotta watch these two rumors like it like me. I don't care who she might be.

574
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:35,420
Because without Ben, I don't get scintail, I won't break and down.

575
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:39,580
Oh, you'll be male. So fuck it. Let's dance, everybody. Raise your hands, fit.

576
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:43,740
Shake that ass, like Marpezia fits. I'm that little real queen born in the bag.

577
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:51,340
Yeah, that I mean now with TVCA, Central Valley, California. Yeah, it's where you fight me today.

578
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:56,060
I'm that bitch, Reppin' Motown. This is for the notes.

579
00:56:56,060 --> 00:57:02,860
How to hold it down. And if you see me with a frown, I'm on empty, by a round.

580
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:07,900
Tell the bartender what to do. Order me to roll that in a head and see through.

581
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:14,540
Rolled, rolled equals, and double face did. The whole table is getting twisted. I just get it true.

582
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:44,460
Yeah, educational, for sure. Double-fisted.

583
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:48,860
Marpezia. Why do I play this? Well, first of all, I liked it.

584
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:56,300
Second of all, wouldn't it be cool if we could melt the hip hop culture and podcast culture together?

585
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:04,940
I mean, that's just an art form that is just oozing through any distribution channel possible.

586
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:08,460
Yeah, you know what you hear on the radio, that's the stuff that makes it through, but it's the stuff that's

587
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:15,580
pounding on cars, on city streets. It's CDs that are being burnt and handed out on in school yards.

588
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:21,500
You know, this is the stuff that is just beautiful for potsafe music and podcasting. If we,

589
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:27,020
you know, if we look at the music side of things, oh, a girl can dream, can't she?

590
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:30,700
Hey, everybody, have yourself a fantastic weekend. I'll be back on Monday.

591
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:34,620
Some time next week, I have to go to the Netherlands for this court case. And of course, we'll

592
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:43,260
be taking the, uh, the Dishiba, uh, slap top with me and with cast blaster with the potfather edition.

593
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:50,060
And so you won't have to miss anything, essentially. I hope not, at least. And, uh,

594
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:56,300
well, if you have any feedback, itemaccurry.com, or, uh, you can always drop a promo at promos.podshow.com.

595
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:02,620
And, of course, this show was found the daily source code.com. We can find the feed to subscribe to

596
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:06,860
and just listen to new episodes as they come online. As Roger Small says, the best thing to do

597
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:11,420
is set that page as your home page. Have a good one, everybody. I'll see you on Monday, bye-bye.
