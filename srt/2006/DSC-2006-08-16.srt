1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,300
The town of Shadow Falls holds a secret so much kill to protect, and others will die to expose.

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,000
Who's here to my dad, didn't you?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Swordle.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,500
I'm the one that killed him.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,000

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
It's on Muscle.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,500
About $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,500
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

15
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,500
I need such a sweet sweet thing to lay.

16
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
Gotta hold on me.

17
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,500
I hope and dose for little ladies.

18
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
I have the plan to see.

19
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,500
I've got a friend who's written the papers.

20
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Thinkin' there's daylight with me.

21
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,500
I feelin' real shut down in my heart.

22
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Feelin' there's daylight with me.

23
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
I see it no more.

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
It's a nice guy.

25
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
No more.

26
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
It's a nice guy.

27
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,500
That's it.

28
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,500
I'm sick.

29
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
I won't see you before.

30
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
I'm sick.

31
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,500
I got a friend who goes and written the papers.

32
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Thinkin' there's daylight with me.

33
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,500
I feelin' real shut down in my heart.

34
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,500
I'm feeling insane, I'm saying no more

35
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,500
It's a nice guy, no more

36
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,500
It's a nice guy, no more

37
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,500
It's a nice guy, they said, I'm saying

38
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
I want to be with you

39
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,500
I don't feel me on the legs today

40
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I can't close my eyes

41
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,500
It's a nice guy, I want to be thrown out of the soul

42
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,500
It's always a circle, and then has the heart

43
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
I went to church, looking at coffee too

44
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
When everybody rules

45
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,500
The river's living, yeah good night's me

46
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,500
The punishment in the nose, they said no more

47
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,500
It's a nice guy, no more

48
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,500
No more, it's a nice guy, they said

49
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:35,500
I said, I'm saying, no more

50
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,500
It's a nice guy, no more

51
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,500
It's a nice guy, they said, I'm saying, I'm saying

52
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
I'm saying, no more

53
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Yeah, yeah

54
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Alice Cooper, no more, it's a nice guy

55
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Live in Montrose, Montrose, which is a lamb

56
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,500
In 2005 from Brand New

57
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,500
DVD, CD, and it's on the pod safe music network.

58
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,100
This is so phenomenal.

59
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,220
This is exactly what we had hoped,

60
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,380
that's a nice fade out, by the way.

61
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,980
This is exactly what we had hoped for

62
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,980
when we started building the pod safe music network.

63
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,420
Wouldn't it be great if these huge artists

64
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,740
could put some of their back catalog up

65
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,500
and have podcasters share that with their audience?

66
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,260
Maybe educate some people about older songs

67
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,780
that we just can't play.

68
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,980
And of course, it's a loophole,

69
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,660
and this is when I'm loving so much.

70
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,340
The master recording, I'm sure that the original

71
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,380
no more Mr. Nice guy is probably owned by

72
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,980
Warner Chapel or some publishing company,

73
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,340
more than likely not owned by Alice Cooper himself.

74
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,340
But the words, and the music he owns, he wrote those,

75
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,620
and he can license that any way he wants.

76
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,300
So apparently, he owns, or I guess,

77
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,700
was this eagle rock entertainment.

78
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,700
He was releasing this DVD, and so this live recording,

79
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,420
he has a whole separate deal, and as a part of the promotion,

80
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,380
yes indeed, it's up on the Ponset Music Network.

81
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,180
So that's really, I mean, think about how phenomenal this can be.

82
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,900
All you have to do as a mainstream artist

83
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,700
is to re-record.

84
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,980
That's all that it takes.

85
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,380
Then of course, I can already hear people going,

86
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,260
oh, what about all the other cool bands

87
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,260
of the Pods of Music Network?

88
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,980
Yeah, I have not forgotten about them,

89
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,620
but I'm just so pleased to see.

90
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,500
Let's see, what do we have?

91
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,020
We had, so first we had Deep Purple come in.

92
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,420
George Thurra Good, Alice Cooper, rainbow,

93
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,420
also now in the Pods of Music Network,

94
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,020
and I'll be playing some Gary Moore at the end of today's Daily

95
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,580
Source Code, which is kind of a weird one,

96
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,620
because you almost didn't have a source code today.

97
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,780
The plan was for me, actually, to go fly

98
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,580
to see Cas Blaster Mike in the Netherlands.

99
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,940
Now, the weather today in Holland is very nice.

100
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,820
Actually, the sun is just starting to break

101
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,140
through a little bit here.

102
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,060
However, this would be my first solo crossing

103
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,260
of the English channel.

104
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,220
You know, I'm a little bit wary of that, particularly,

105
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,380
because I didn't have the practice that I wanted to do

106
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,220
over the past weekend.

107
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,700
And they are expecting about 35 knots of wind near the end

108
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,380
of the afternoon and thunderstorms and rain.

109
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,060
And that's pretty much the spot where I would cross

110
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,420
Ostenda, which is the shortest route

111
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,700
across the English channel.

112
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,740
So it's from basically in Belgium,

113
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,500
so from Belgium, I'd fly up.

114
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,180
But coming back, the only alternative would be to take

115
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,300
the long route, which, of course, I've done many, many times,

116
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,460
but with a safety pilot, and I just don't really

117
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,300
feel confident enough to do it.

118
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,660
And I think that that's really what aviation is about

119
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,500
is when you know your limits and when you know

120
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,340
that you cannot do something or you shouldn't

121
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,420
probably be doing something.

122
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,900
It's much safer for me and for the environment.

123
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,540
So maybe Sunday, I don't know, it's so much to do.

124
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,140
Yesterday, of course, there was no daily source code,

125
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,940
my apologies for that.

126
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,140
I fully intended to do one.

127
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,340
I had a whole day of meetings in the city in London

128
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,180
with Neil Dixon, who was working

129
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,260
with this pod show UK, meeting some extremely talented people.

130
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,940
Just spent the whole day outside.

131
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,260
It wasn't really that sunny, but it was just really nice.

132
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,620
It wasn't chilly or windy.

133
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,220
And we just hung out and drank habachinos

134
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,380
and talked about all kinds of cool stuff.

135
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,300
And how wonderful it could be.

136
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,060
If all the talent that people in the world could have

137
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,500
all the distribution they wanted.

138
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,220
And it was just, it was fantastic.

139
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,060
And how, man, there was a, was it pod fest

140
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,980
was last night in London that's feel coin?

141
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,700
Is it a bit job for the masses?

142
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,420
You can find it, I think it's a podfest.com.

143
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,980
And so a lot of people from the pod casting

144
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,940
seem we're going there last night and unfortunately

145
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,660
I couldn't attend because, oh, you know,

146
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,700
we still have you gone here and there's just lots to do.

147
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,700
And it was so warm last night.

148
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,220
I woke up at least five times.

149
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,460
So anyway, so the reason was no show on Mondays

150
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,020
because I'd set the alarm for seven o'clock.

151
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,620
You know, Christina still doesn't have to go to school.

152
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,580
So we're getting up about an hour later, typically.

153
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,380
But in order for me to make my one o'clock meetings,

154
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,580
I had to really set the alarm.

155
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,580
And somewhere in the middle of the night,

156
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,340
the alarm clock fell off the nightstand, the battery popped out.

157
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,940
And so we woke up around 9.39, 45.

158
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,900
And I'm like, okay, I guess we won't have time

159
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,340
to do a show because it takes some time.

160
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,900
And now that I'm catching up,

161
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,860
I asked Patricia today, I said,

162
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,140
would you mind doing a show?

163
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,380
And whenever she answers, well, what time do you want to do it?

164
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,060
And she knows that I have to have this done by like 130

165
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,060
in the afternoon in order to hit the satellite window

166
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,180
for Peter.

167
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,100
So she knows that.

168
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,860
And that's kind of her secret way of saying,

169
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,100
I have other stuff to do today.

170
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,260
No.

171
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,580
And the other stuff is her sister Ivana's leaving today.

172
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,100
So I kind of understand, they wanted it.

173
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,420
I think go into town one more time

174
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,020
walk on the high street and do whatever.

175
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,220
And it's sisters, you can't come between them.

176
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,780
So tomorrow, Patricia will definitely be on the show.

177
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,580
I promise you that.

178
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,460
And I've got lots of stuff to do.

179
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,420
The visual communicator, studio software package

180
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,940
came in today is huge.

181
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,980
And I didn't, this is cool.

182
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,020
They actually sent me a green screen.

183
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,980
It's a part of the package.

184
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,140
You can hang it behind you if you want to do virtual sets

185
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,220
and stuff.

186
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,220
So I'm sure I'll be playing around with that a little bit today.

187
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,340
And lots of communication with San Francisco.

188
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,580
You may have noticed, if you checked out podshow.com,

189
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,620
that all that work we did over the weekend up until all the way

190
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,100
through yesterday is starting to pay off.

191
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,100
We've added extra freedom to the system.

192
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,100
All kinds of server configurations and stuff.

193
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,740
And man, the site is just flying.

194
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,180
So that means that once we have this all cordoned off

195
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,580
and we're happy with the performance,

196
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,340
now we can really start to build out some features.

197
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,340
Because I have to say, you guys

198
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,180
came in in a little bit stronger numbers

199
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,740
than we anticipated initially.

200
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,940
And we'd set up, obviously, what is it?

201
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,500
Load balance stuff and all that.

202
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,780
But still, we definitely had to configure

203
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,340
a few of their servers to keep up with the demand.

204
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:05,500
So show-wise today, I had about 50 different voice

205
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,820
mill messages.

206
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,620
And I thought, I'll play a couple of things

207
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,420
that I just have laying around that I've been

208
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,020
meaning to share with you.

209
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,820
And then maybe we just go through a couple of these voice

210
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,580
metals and just see what people are saying

211
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,500
because it's just a shame not to do anything with them

212
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,740
and just to let them go.

213
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,180
And by the way, it's your contribution to the share.

214
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,260
Hi there Adam.

215
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,260
And this.

216
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:24,940
Yeah.

217
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,900
This is Eric and Andrea from Let's Get Nautie.

218
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,700
The next time you're in a steamy, a soldier

219
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,260
and let's face a naughty mood, you need to tune into our

220
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,180
show.

221
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,460
We're fine.

222
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,940
We're insightful and we're downright provocative.

223
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,020
So if you are all about pleasure and pleasing others,

224
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,700
give us a listen.

225
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,980
And Adam, we know you like pleasure.

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,980
You can find us at www.let'sgetnautiepodcast.com

or subscribe to us in iTunes.

228
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,700
That just started my weekend off just fine.

229
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,900
The app's so loosely.

230
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,700
I use a show that I've been working with

231
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,700
Jay Donnelly on this.

232
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,820
I mean, I'm not really working on it,

233
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,100
but I've been giving him feedback and giving some suggestions.

234
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,980
And this is something that we talked about on the daily source

235
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,900
code a long time ago about doing test drives of cars.

236
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,700
Just going up and saying, hey, can I do a test drive?

237
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,140
And recording it, of course.

238
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,420
Now he's taken it one step further with his girlfriend Holly.

239
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,420
And they're actually recording this on video.

240
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,740
And I think some of the sales people are now

241
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,380
cluing or tuning into the fact that they might actually not

242
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,900
be there to buy.

243
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,580
But the episode five of Test Drive Girl is out.

244
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,180
Hey, everybody, Jay Donnelly with you.

245
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,340
And on today's show, the Test Drive Girl,

246
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,340
what's the latest episode of this week?

247
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,900
Yeah, we're test driving the Kia Sorrento this week.

248
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,260
And how did that go?

249
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,940
Well, you have to watch the show on Friday.

250
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,860
I'm not going to tell you all my details.

251
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,060
Yeah, okay.

252
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,460
So, uh, all right, did you enjoy the ride?

253
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,100
Was it a good ride?

254
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,540
Oh, I enjoyed the sales guy.

255
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,500
That was a good ride.

256
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,980
Oh, yeah.

257
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,060
Yeah, I heard you called him a honey.

258
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,820
Oh, yes.

259
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,980
So go to test drivegirl.com.

260
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,980
Check out the latest episode of the Test Drive Girl.

261
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,100
Right on.

262
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,980
I like it, man.

263
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,740
It's cool.

264
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,020
Because it's a real test drive.

265
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,660
And you can see these sales guys bullshit in their way through.

266
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,100
It's fantastic.

267
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,300
Okay, hitting the voice mill numbers.

268
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
Of course, the number, if you don't have a pre-programmed

269
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,780
and you're mobile phone cell phone yet, uh,

270
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,740
do the plus thing.

271
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,420
Now, we went through this, um,

272
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,940
want to go there Friday.

273
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,460
So, plus is usually accessed by hitting zero twice or whatever.

274
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:37,580
And then, uh, one for the country code two zero one for Jersey 65 65 65 seven

275
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,260
or London 020 76813753.

276
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,260
Hey, Adam, it's Paul Parkinson.

277
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,860
Uh, thanks for the shout out on, uh, yesterday's show.

278
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,900
But, uh, man, um, Patecast Paul isn't Paul Parkinson on Paul Parkinson.

279
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,700
And Paulcast Paul is a lawyer from Birmingham and does the

280
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,540
Paul Parkinson podcast Paul podcast.

281
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,940
He's also on podcast using magazine.

282
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,700
I'm Paul Parkinson.

283
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,980
And I'm known as Parkinson.

284
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:07,260
I do the flashing tall podcast in the weird nylon podcast and I do podcast using magazine.

285
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,820
Paul Pinfield is Paul Pinfield.

286
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,700
And he does the calm cast and podcast using magazine.

287
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,660
He said your confused can you imagine what it's like for us?

288
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,860
Um, Paul Parkinson, I may take it.

289
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,140
Oh, one more thing.

290
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,660
I hope you're wordless the other day.

291
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,300
Have you seen the V's website?

292
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,540
www.vz.co.uk.

293
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,980
I have check out the perfanysaurus section.

294
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,740
Um, I'm sure some of those won't make you onto the list.

295
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,940
But, uh, have a look.

296
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,980
Tell me what you think.

297
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,780
I'm like, cheers.

298
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,980
Fuck.

299
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,020
This is so moment brought to you by all the Pauls in the UK.

300
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,780
Yeah, it's too confusing for me, man.

301
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,980
I can't keep you guys apart.

302
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,220
You know, I got a drumstick from from Paul one or Paul two and

303
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,220
Paul three and

304
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,540
You're right, it is confusing.

305
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,900
It's way too much for me.

306
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,500
Let's see, uh, a lot of feedback on, uh,

307
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:03,740
on my mini rant about that story on MPR, uh, about, uh,

308
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,860
flying business or first class and and how that actually

309
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,780
subsidizes, um, a economy cast, a class travel.

310
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,140
Boy, you guys respond to pretty strongly to that.

311
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,020
I wish you would send in more audio comments because, you know,

312
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,980
just reading stuff off comments isn't all that compelling.

313
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,620
So you can call in the voicemail line anytime.

314
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,140
No one really yelling at me on the voicemail line as much as they were in the comments.

315
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,460
Uh, but there was some feedback on it.

316
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,900
Hey, Adam, it's been from Southern California.

317
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,540
Um, just listening to the DSC 4401, we'll see the guy from MPR.

318
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,540
It's like, doesn't he get it?

319
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,300
Communism's dying.

320
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,300
Capitalism is getting.

321
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,180
He's got the money.

322
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,380
Get to do things.

323
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,020
If you want to do things with those guys you're doing,

324
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,220
you work your butt off.

325
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,180
It's kind of like the pressure complaining about you having no butt.

326
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,460
It's because you worked it off and you're reading the benefits.

327
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,420
That's what it's about.

328
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,740
So if you're accepting your standing in line, hey,

329
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,820
then you get out of the line, go back to work.

330
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,700
See you later.

331
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,340
Holder?

332
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,740
Huh, I bet you that was a folder.

333
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,340
And there was a lot of talk about, uh, about these about the foil terror attacks.

334
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,460
And I, I got to tell you, I'm, I'm growing a little bit skeptical.

335
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:22,380
I really am, uh, you know, main reason being where is the follow-up?

336
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,420
You know, so okay.

337
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,500
So we, we got all these dangerous guys.

338
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,460
We rounded them up.

339
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,100
I guess in the UK, they can hold them for up to 28 days.

340
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,740
But where's the proof?

341
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,540
You know, I should, now I think when you need some follow-up, we really need the follow-up.

342
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,700
And, and if I'm going to hear the message, well, we can't tell you about these guys

343
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,580
because that's not in the interest of national security,

344
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,940
then I'm going to be probably a non-believer in what's going on.

345
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,900
And you know my standpoint on this.

346
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,660
I'm just not going to be scared into anything.

347
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,700
I'm going to fly.

348
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,860
I'm going to do whatever I can in life legally, obviously.

349
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,140
Something's maybe borderline.

350
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,540
But I'm not going to let me, I'm just not going to be scared away by anything.

351
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,500
And I'd like some proof.

352
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,260
I'd like some proof as to what the plot was.

353
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,900
Okay.

354
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,860
So what do we know?

355
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,900
It was like liquid.

356
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,740
It could have been in liquid explosives.

357
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:17,260
In perfume bottles or lipstick in casings or in baby formula.

358
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,460
Okay, that's all fine.

359
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,700
You know, and they arrested a couple who had a baby who the woman was nursing.

360
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
I'd like a little bit of proof on this, guys.

361
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,340
I don't change from the U.K.

362
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:32,700
I'm just listening to the, it's not even something like what's in the screen.

363
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,300
And it's the call, the call about that conspiracy theory,

364
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,460
the very quiet blogger running.

365
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,540
Just something, it said, run with me or he said that he's giving you no proof.

366
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,060
Neither of the American government given anybody any proof.

367
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,420
It's all, everything that they've come up with so far speculation.

368
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,980
We've got no video evidence.

369
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,940
We've got no call evidence that there was anything on anybody on those planes online.

370
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,980
Yeah, that's really interesting.

371
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,620
You say that.

372
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,260
I just wanted to jump in here because in the United Kingdom,

373
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,580
there are hundreds of thousands of security cameras everywhere.

374
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:13,340
They're known as CCTV closed circuit television.

375
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,260
And I think the statistic is, if you walk around or if you're any,

376
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,100
if you're outside anywhere in the United Kingdom,

377
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,660
you're caught on camera at least 30 times a day.

378
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:27,340
And with every other crime that takes place in the United Kingdom,

379
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,540
immediately on the news, you see the CCTV footage.

380
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,140
You know, they show you what's happening.

381
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:37,580
They show you who's involved and the picture quality is fantastic.

382
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,180
Not a single piece of video about any of these guys.

383
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,300
These alleged terrorists.

384
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,340
Not a single piece.

385
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,740
So, yeah, it's a very fuel level uneasy.

386
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:51,020
11, and I think somebody, I'm one of these videos,

387
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:57,100
had some kind of proof, maybe not as much proof as we think about success.

388
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,100
Six or seven of these people are still actually alive.

389
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,420
That was supposed to be on the planes and we're in a normal jobs in America.

390
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:08,060
So, you know, it's fair enough to make a comment like you've got no proof,

391
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,380
do you learn government that's given you more proof either?

392
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,580
Yeah.

393
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,900
It is a bit strange, however you think turned out.

394
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,940
But there you go.

395
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,900
See you there on that fire.

396
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,940
All right.

397
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,900
I agree.

398
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,340
I haven't seen much proof anywhere.

399
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,540
It's really hard.

400
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,140
I'm tired of it.

401
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,500
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

402
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,780
You know, I'll wrap this up with Matt from

403
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,620
Matt's today in history podcast.

404
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,500
He actually had some pretty good to say that I liked a lot.

405
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,540
Check this out.

406
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,500
Hey, Adam.

407
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,380
This is Matt Bittil of the Matt's today in history podcast.

408
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:44,380
I was listening to episode 441 of the Charlie and you had a call from

409
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:49,580
a gentleman, I believe from Austin, Texas, who was talking about the fact that, you know,

410
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:55,820
supposedly you and I and a lot of other people don't know what's going on with regard to 911.

411
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:01,260
What really happened with the volunteers really about and that we need to sort of wake up and

412
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,220
you know, find out that we're all being fooled and all that.

413
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,820
And I will say, I'm sure there are things done by governments around the world every day

414
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,820
that are pretty terrible that you and I will never, ever find out about.

415
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:23,660
However, I think and you probably know this that there is a huge industry that is a

416
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:29,820
risen out of 911 conspiracies and the problem is that the people who write these books and put

417
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:38,060
up these websites and that you hear on late night terrestrial radio, they take advantage of people

418
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:46,540
who, they need that, they need a conspiracy to somehow explain the fact that there are people

419
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,340
in the world who hate them just because of who they are.

420
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:58,300
The problem with this is that it's dangerous. History is full of sort of, you know, propaganda

421
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:03,900
that was created out of thin air that drove entire populations to dangerous activity.

422
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:10,380
If you look at the protocols of the elders of Zion, which was published in the early 20th century,

423
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:17,900
that basically claimed that the, everyone of the Jewish race was out to dominate the world,

424
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:24,540
you know, even Hitler and the Nazis used it as an excuse to put Jews and camps.

425
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:31,020
And so, you know, you have to be very careful when all logic points in one direction,

426
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,980
then that's probably the direction we need to look. I mean, you can certainly look at,

427
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,260
you know, the Bush administration or the Blair administration and say that there are things you

428
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:46,460
don't like and certainly there are things that I don't like. However, that doesn't mean

429
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:53,820
there's a worldwide conspiracy to pull the wool over our eyes. So anyway, that's today in history.com

430
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:59,180
and scruncher. Thanks. Wait a minute, he said it, he's a scruncher!

431
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,460
There's I'm a weapon, weapon, weapon, weapon, weapon, weapon.

432
00:21:46,460 --> 00:22:15,260
You know what I received in my email box this morning?

433
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:23,260
I received the third episode, the rough mix of Shadow Falls, which I believe we're going to release

434
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:28,700
on Monday. If you have not heard this originally produced audio drama from Pod Show,

435
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,620
listen to it at ShadowFalls.podshow.com. It will scare the pants off of you.

436
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:42,060
Mark Yoshimaru, an improv, probably pissed off about you. Let me just, uh, let me uh, let me

437
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:47,100
play the opening for you. You'll immediately be wanting to hear the episode. There's a story that

438
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:54,140
people tell in Shadow Falls, a story about a well. Back in the 1700s, the town elders decided to

439
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:59,580
dig a new well because the old one had gone bad. I leave it up to you to decide what that means.

440
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,180
Every able body male took part in the digging and hauling a birth for the new site. After five

441
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:09,660
days of back breaking work, the new well was finished and the town elders went to close up the old

442
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:15,660
well wasn't for all. One old man who claimed to know such things said the old well had been

443
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:20,620
cursed because the people of Shadow Falls had not pleased the spirits. He told them of an old

444
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:26,620
tradition after the harvest festival when, along with condemned prisoners. One thing is until

445
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:34,380
I'll put it all so we sacrifice to it. For every light that shines, a Shadow Falls.

446
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:46,460
I love it. I have not listened to, uh, uh, I've not listened to the, uh, entire episode. Yeah,

447
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:51,260
but I'll report back on it tomorrow and it should be dropping on Monday. Shadow Falls.podshow.com.

448
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,660
You know, there was a, I cannot, where was this? I had a comment somewhere.

449
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:02,300
Someone had met one of the, uh, one of the actors on Shadow Falls. Crap, what was that?

450
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:08,140
Hold on a second. Let me see if I, hmm. I guess I lost it.

451
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,660
Oh, I'm sorry about that. You just have to go and listen to it on Monday and I'll look for that

452
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,700
for that comment. I'm a little bit discombobulated today. I would say, and I think I had to do

453
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:27,100
with bad sleep. If you're listening to us on, uh, Syria stars 102, here's what's coming up tonight.

454
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:32,540
It's Wednesday, uh, right after this show Pacific Coast Hall, hell, hallway Pacific Coast

455
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,260
Hellway, uh, Dawn and Drew, then a great show that, uh, it's called American cliche is also on

456
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,580
the podshow podcast network. Then Michael Butler with a rock and roll geek show and then a non-pod

457
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,740
safe program, which you can only hear on series, which is the Frank truth, Brian No brings you

458
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:51,420
the world that is Frank's. We just live in it. East radio after that and we wind it up with another

459
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:57,020
fine audio drama Scott's signal that'll be between 930 and 10 o'clock eastern time. On Syria stars 102,

460
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:02,140
uh, I'll talk to you guys tomorrow. Um, and if you want to hear more of this show, go to dailysourceco.com

461
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:07,420
or check out podshow.com for a whole bunch of cool podcasts. And for those of you still hanging around here,

462
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,380
we got the other's ramblings in a crap horse. Like, and that's Troy. I want to play the whole thing.

463
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,580
Hey, and it's Troy from Rutgers ramblings. You know, the iPod guy. Well, it hasn't arrived yet,

464
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:21,500
but you'll be one of the first to know when it does get here. Anyway, I wanted to drop you a note

465
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:28,300
for something that I saw on podshow plus over the weekend. Well, you know how Google and Yahoo and

466
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:34,940
even I think my space has their own start page for their users set up to be my dot

467
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:41,420
whatever, you know, my dot google dot com or my dot yahoo dot com or, you know, something of that nature. Well,

468
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:51,180
someone has actually registered the name my on podshow plus. So whenever you go to my dot podshow.com,

469
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:57,420
it goes to their homepage. And there's a few of us who have been digging the so-called my

470
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:03,180
in an effort. I don't know to see if people are actually going there. Like, I tried to.

471
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:08,380
And I could have sworn that that used to go to your your homepage if you had cookies enabled. But

472
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:14,460
maybe I'm just, uh, remembering it wrong. But whoever my is definitely, uh, definitely gets

473
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:20,220
a not a my book because that's pretty ingenious. So anyway, like they always say, keep up the good work.

474
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:25,980
And I'll be listening. Ew. Thanks, Troy. That's kind of interesting. I haven't received the iPod yet.

475
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,020
I thought I'd already want to. Let me know if you don't receive it this week. Okay, and I'll check with

476
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:34,940
jocelyn. A lot of rumblings in second. Let me just respond to that for a second. So, you know,

477
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:42,540
having a my dot your company named dot com is, uh, is very 1990 my book. That's what's cool about

478
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:47,740
podshow plus is you get to make your own URL. So it can be anything you want dot podshow dot com.

479
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,900
And you can also map a domain name to it. If you have something else, and then the site will

480
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,220
understand that and we'll actually pick it up and respond as if it's a I actually haven't even

481
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,420
done that myself. But it's a capability we've built in that I'll go back and do that for the daily

482
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:07,660
source code dot com. So you can check it out. Um, lots of rumblings in second life.

483
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:14,380
It's about me saying that if Duran Duran is coming in, it's, uh, it's officially unhip.

484
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:19,980
And I don't want to be a part of it. There are still plenty of reasons to check out second life.

485
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:27,660
Adam, this is a hippie geek book from second life. The newest resident of podshow island. I

486
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:33,740
wanted to remind everybody about the podbong that you can only pick up on podshow island.

487
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:42,220
Place all the podcasts and podcasters or every day adding new shows to it.

488
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:50,540
It's aggregating the RSS feeds and it's absolutely free. So come on down to podshow island and

489
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,380
pick up the podbong. Adios, man.

490
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,380
There's nothing like lurking on a virtual bomb, my friends.

491
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:05,260
Hey, Adam, I'm pretty up to Rob Kerns from the Navy Reserve podcast. Find that at

492
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:10,780
NavyReserves.navy.mil. Just want to call lunch and know that we're on our fifth podcast now and things

493
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:17,100
are growing great over here. We're getting in some actual web stats from around the, uh, the Navy and

494
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:22,780
are from around the world and it's going great. What's a particularly amazing is that since we launched

495
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:28,220
our podcast, we've been starting to get calls here from other entities in the Navy wanting to know

496
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:34,060
how they can get a podcast going. And now big Navy has even launched the podcast, much of period

497
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:39,980
to ours because we're actually trying to make it a real show where a lot of these other elements

498
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:45,580
are just putting out new stories. But about once a week now, I'm getting one of two calls,

499
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:51,740
people ask me in the Navy about podcasting, how we developed it and how it's growing and how

500
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:57,260
what our feedback has been. So it's growing and it's growing exponentially. So I'm sure

501
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:02,460
not getting as many hits as the DSC, but we're growing out there. So thanks a lot, Adam, for all

502
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:08,540
your kind of words about us and here continue to support other Navy Reserve podcast. So anchors

503
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:12,780
away. Take care, man. Bye bye. Oh, that's a good one. Anchors are way. I'd like to know if you're

504
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:19,500
folder or scruncher. Yeah, that's it's good. I like it for our service men and women in the Navy.

505
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:24,620
I'm wondering when everyone else is going to join our board and gee, want to be nice if we could

506
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:29,740
really get some podcasts that we could send overseas for our boys and girls over there,

507
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:35,580
not just Americans but Brits, Japanese, Dutch, you name it, they're all over the place.

508
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:46,620
Would you please remind me to play Carmen Tyler tomorrow? She sent me just a beautiful,

509
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:53,420
beautiful, yeah should I play that for you? Hold on a second. Don't tell me I lost it.

510
00:29:54,780 --> 00:30:00,540
What's up with that? Oh, man, this is so lame. Well, anyway,

511
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:07,900
hold on a second. Oh, this is making me angry. I think I lost them a whole bunch of files or something.

512
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:14,380
This is really weird. Well, Karen Tyler sent me this this really wonderful voice feedback.

513
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:21,980
I'm still searching my desktop as you can tell. Yeah, shoot. Okay. Did you know that she's a

514
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:26,620
former Miss Louisiana? And now that I'm looking at her picture again on the podcast, music now,

515
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:33,020
we're going to go like, uh-huh, but she is. So remind me to play that tomorrow and I'll get out of

516
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:43,180
you here now with one last song from PMN. It's Gary Moore. Remember here? If you're talking about

517
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:49,980
great guitarists in the world, now you'd probably say maybe Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton. Some might say

518
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:56,220
be king. But when I think about what we have over here in the UK,

519
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:03,020
without a doubt, Gary Moore springs to mind. Listen to that sound of gunna reign today.

520
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:27,980
Yeah?

521
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,820
Outside.

522
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,620
LosЕder is shiny.

523
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:57,980
It's feeling like we're both the way

524
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:03,980
But inside

525
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:09,980
My heart is planned

526
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:17,980
And I find it's going to rain

527
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:29,980
Two days

528
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:35,980
Everybody

529
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:43,980
I see a smile

530
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:53,980
As they watch the children play

531
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:59,980
But for me

532
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,980
No reconciling

533
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:12,980
And I find it's going to rain

534
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:20,980
Two days

535
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:26,980
All the clouds have come

536
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:32,980
Everybody sees the sun

537
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,980
But for me

538
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,980
No reconciling

539
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,980
The clouds have come

540
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:44,980
And I find it's going to rain

541
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:50,980
And I find it's going to rain

542
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:58,980
The sun is shining

543
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,980
But never see

544
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:10,980
She went away

545
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,980
Inside

546
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:20,980
My heart keeps planned

547
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:26,980
And I find it's going to rain

548
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:32,980
Two days

549
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,980
Yes, I'm free

550
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:38,980
It's going to rain

551
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,980
Two

552
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,980
Oh, man, how beautiful is that?

553
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,980
Chuh!

554
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,980
Listen to that guitar

555
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:58,980
Now I know I couldn't find Carmen Tyler

556
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,980
Because the comment she sent

557
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,980
was actually a tag

558
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,980
Which I've been asking you to do

559
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,980
I think it was Suzanne from InsideWorks

560
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,980
Who did the tag for today

561
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,980
And there was another one in there

562
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,980
I love it when you just please send me tags for the source code

563
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,980
You know, I have 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 3

564
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,980
I don't have a 4, 4, 4, 4 or a 5 or a 6 or a 7

565
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,980
But what Carmen did is she sent me 4, 5, 0

566
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,980
Hey, this is recording artist in former Miss Luziana Carmen Tyler

567
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,980
And you're listening to Delta Sierra Charlie Show number 450

568
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,980
With the pod father himself

569
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,980
Adam Curry

570
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,980
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

571
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,980
Can't wait until 450

572
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:42,980
Send me a picture to put in 450 Carmen Luziana

573
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,980
All right, everybody

574
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,980
I'm going to keep my eye on the weather

575
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,980
But I really don't think it's going to happen

576
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,980
That'll be flying today at least not

577
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,980
The risk is just a bit on the high side for me

578
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,980
And I'll be back tomorrow

579
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,980
More than likely with the lady Patricia

580
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
She has promised mind you

581
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,980
