1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
For the first time ever, the Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. in one action-packed DVD collection,

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,000
own all 27 episodes, the cult hit, including all new interviews with Carlton Koo.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,560
First thing that Brisco did that impressed us was, we're not only to come in and really read the dialogue well as an actor,

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,720
but he also did a standing flip in our office.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,640
You flipped too for Brisco County!

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,360
If you like the kind of TV you can't get on TV, get your copy of the Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,360
Available now on DVD.

8
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,360
There's nothing that they both can't do.

9
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,360
But make you wild as dreams come true.

10
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,360
So grab your ear buds and jam them in.

11
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,360
And let the fabulous show begin.

12
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,360
It's Adam and Patricia.

13
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,360
Yes, Adam and Patricia.

14
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,360
Adam and the Lady Patricia.

15
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:39,360
I don't know.

16
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,360
It's the sign of the time for the New Year.

17
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,360
Like I'm going through today.

18
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,360
I don't know.

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:58,360
If I'm losing my mind, but I'm lost and blind, I don't take it.

20
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,360
Is there any way I wanna hear?

21
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,360
Is there some way to make this really hear?

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:21,360
Because of you, I can't sleep anymore since you walked up the door and you left me.

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,360
All I do is stare at the wall,

24
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,360
I think you know, thoughts at all, sempre memories.

25
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,360
Why do you wanna try to be insane?

26
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,360
Why do you wanna cause me so much pain for me?

27
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,360
I don't think I can't make it on my own.

28
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:56,360
If I'm losing my mind, but I'm lost and blind, I don't take it.

29
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,360
I don't think I can't make it on my own.

30
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:09,360
If I'm losing my mind, but I'm lost and blind, I don't take it.

31
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
I can't feel.

32
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,360
Don't know darkness from light, don't know daytime from night on this recent.

33
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Is it real?

34
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,360
Or will I wake up from this and the midst of your cares and embrace it?

35
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,360
What they're gonna miss both the two.

36
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,360
I don't think I can make it without you for me.

37
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,360
I don't think I can't make it on my own.

38
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,360
Don't think I can't make it on my own.

39
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Why do you wanna try to be insane?

40
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,360
Why do you wanna cause me so much pain for me?

41
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,360
I don't think I can't make it on my own.

42
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,360
If I'm losing my mind, but I'm lost and blind, I don't take it.

43
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:06,360
I don't think I can't make it on my own.

44
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,360
Why do you wanna cause me so much pain for me?

45
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,360
I don't think I can't make it on my own.

46
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,360
I don't think I can't make it on my own.

47
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,360
I don't think I can't make it on my own.

48
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,360
Why do you wanna cause me so much pain for me?

49
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,360
I don't think I can't make it on my own.

50
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Why do you wanna cause me so much pain for me?

51
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,360
I don't think I can't make it on my own.

52
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,360
But I don't think I can make it on my own.

53
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,080
But I might die here on the long way

54
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,040
Show me size

55
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,840
They'll need that you're still in the way of me

56
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,240
What's going on?

57
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah

58
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,920
So many times

59
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,960
It's our life

60
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,960
It's our life

61
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:34,960
I don't think I don't like about that song as the windy fade out.

62
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,960
That's a bummer, isn't it?

63
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,960
I just want to...

64
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
Kevin Reeves, just throw me a line.

65
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,960
You like that song, don't you?

66
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,960
They still fade out these days.

67
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,960
Apparently.

68
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,960
Kevin Reeves does.

69
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
Yeah.

70
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,960
Yeah.

71
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
I don't like that anymore.

72
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
No.

73
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
I like songs to end.

74
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
Yeah, but jokes don't like that.

75
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
Jocks?

76
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
Jocks?

77
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
Jocks?

78
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,960
What do you mean Jocks?

79
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,960
I always...

80
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,960
I always...

81
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,960
Very confused.

82
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
I would fade out.

83
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Yeah.

84
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,960
Man, you really love Terry Wogan, don't you?

85
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
Oh, I love him, yeah.

86
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
He's sweet.

87
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
What does he...

88
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
He makes like...

89
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,960
Such a gentleman.

90
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
I like that.

91
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,960
He does like a million pounds a year at BBC.

92
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
Oh, yeah.

93
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
And he works an hour and a half each morning.

94
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,960
Yeah.

95
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,960
And goes on vacation.

96
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
Yeah, was it?

97
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,960
He...

98
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,960
Was it from 730 to 9, I think?

99
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
Is that what he does?

100
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Not more than that.

101
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
And sometimes, suddenly, he's gone in the morning.

102
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
Oh, yeah.

103
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,960
And then they go on vacation.

104
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Johnny Walker or whatever the hell he got his name is.

105
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
They don't like Johnny Walker.

106
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
No, I don't.

107
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
No.

108
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,960
Well, I mean, I don't know the guy.

109
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
I just...

110
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
I miss Terry.

111
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
If you're going to have to listen to Terry Wogan,

112
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
then at least get used to it.

113
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Yeah.

114
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
Better listen to the real one.

115
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Hey, everybody.

116
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
How you doing?

117
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,960
It's a daily source code coming to you from the curry cottage

118
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,960
that's already known as Guildford episode number 470 already,

119
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,960
which, uh, hey,

120
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,960
Honda you've heard about 10 of those.

121
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
Haven't you?

122
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
What?

123
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,960
Well, I was reading.

124
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Yeah.

125
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
He's not even listening to this show.

126
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
Hey.

127
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
Yeah.

128
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
Good.

129
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
Are you reading through the...

130
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
I'm reading your show, perhaps.

131
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
It's something very interesting.

132
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
It's sex myths.

133
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
Sex myths.

134
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
Yeah.

135
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,960
I was very curious about that.

136
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,960
Okay.

137
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
And give me a sex myth.

138
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,960
And what is the form out of the story?

139
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
Same sex fantasy.

140
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,960
Must mean I'm gay.

141
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
Um, hold on a second.

142
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
Let me answer the questions.

143
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,960
Um...

144
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
No.

145
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,960
No.

146
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
No.

147
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
It's totally normal.

148
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,960
Okay.

149
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
Next.

150
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
I'll do this.

151
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,960
Sex is bad for people with a heart disease.

152
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
No. It's very good for people with heart disease.

153
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,960
Exactly.

154
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
Then don't worry.

155
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Next one.

156
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
I'm good at this.

157
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,960
This is really easy.

158
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
This is almost insulting.

159
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
To my sexual intelligence.

160
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,960
If he pulls out, I won't get pregnant.

161
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,960
If he pulls out, I won't get pregnant.

162
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
That's one young girl's thing.

163
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,960
No.

164
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,960
Obviously, that's not true.

165
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,960
Obviously, that's a myth.

166
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,960
Obviously.

167
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,960
Give me a hard one.

168
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,960
Isn't there something better?

169
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
Get back to the gay stuff.

170
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
I was funny.

171
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,960
Let me see.

172
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,960
Not all women have a g-spot.

173
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,960
All women have a g-spot.

174
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
Not all women have discovered their g-spot.

175
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
Right.

176
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,960
And they might be on a different spot.

177
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Yeah.

178
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,960
Just email adamantpodshow.com and I'll point it out to you.

179
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
Yeah.

180
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,960
Happy to send you graphics and instructional power points.

181
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,960
There's something gay about Adam.

182
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,960
There's something you have to admit to.

183
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,960
There's something gay about Adam.

184
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,960
But you know you like it a bit.

185
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,960
Adam's got a great big house.

186
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,960
Adam's got a pretty life.

187
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,960
Adam's got a daughter who cares.

188
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,960
Adam's got a pretty good life but you know.

189
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,960
That he's kind of a mow.

190
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,960
There's something gay about Adam.

191
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,960
There's something you have to admit.

192
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,960
There's something gay about Adam.

193
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,960
But you know you like it a bit.

194
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,960
Adam used to have really big hair.

195
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,960
Adam used to have funny, bowloat ties.

196
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Adam used to have assholes like the chaps.

197
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,960
Adam used to have photos of Kurt Loder and him trying on bikinis.

198
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Some are house and fire Island but as far as I know it's just a rumor.

199
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:36,960
But you know that you like him so.

200
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,960
There's something gay about Adam.

201
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
I think it's a hit.

202
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,960
There's something you have to admit.

203
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,960
There's something gay about Adam.

204
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,960
But you know you like it a bit.

205
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,960
Does he swallow a spit?

206
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
How?

207
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
The song is sounding like shit.

208
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,960
Yeah.

209
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,960
Thank you Mark Hiroshima to them, Carl.

210
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
Isn't that great?

211
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,960
We've built a company where I can actually pay people to do that stuff.

212
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,960
And I didn't ask for just, you know, people just sit around all day and say,

213
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,960
What could I do for the boss?

214
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,960
You know, let me write a song about him being a bit gay.

215
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Oh, nice.

216
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,960
That awesome.

217
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Yeah, fantastic.

218
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
I think it's a hit.

219
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
It's kind of the mellow yellow.

220
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,960
And isn't it true?

221
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
What?

222
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,960
But something gay about you.

223
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
But I spit.

224
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
I'm just in touch with my team.

225
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Don't we love that?

226
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
We women love that.

227
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Last night we were watching a documentary about Courtney Love.

228
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
From rehab to re-recording.

229
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,960
And it wasn't a really good documentary.

230
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
No.

231
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,960
But it was done with a, you know, with a DV camera.

232
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,960
So it was a very private private documentary.

233
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
It was a close impression.

234
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,960
And I think it was difficult to taper, to actually.

235
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,960
Well, I think I thought that the guy who did it got really good access to,

236
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
to Courtney.

237
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,960
And he was, he's literally everywhere.

238
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,960
But at one point, she talked about what really turned her on.

239
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
And what did she say?

240
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,960
She said, the nerdy ear, the key key ear, the more genius.

241
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,960
What I always say.

242
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,960
She said, if you got glasses, if you wear and shit,

243
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
shit clothes, you look like door aliens.

244
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,960
And I can learn something from you.

245
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,960
She said intelligence is intelligent.

246
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
Yeah.

247
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
It's sexy.

248
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
True.

249
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
True.

250
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
I got to get the insight for PDF and start learning.

251
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
I love people with talents.

252
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,960
And she said, I don't even, I don't, then if I'm impressed with the talent.

253
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,960
And, you know, if they're brilliant, I don't even look out.

254
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
You know, the way they look.

255
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,960
I don't think it's, it's important.

256
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,960
It's funny because I was talking to Christina about that this morning.

257
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Oh, yeah.

258
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
On our, you know, that's why I take it to school.

259
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
It's because she could take the bus, you know.

260
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,960
But it's fun because we chat and we talk about shit.

261
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,960
And this, this came up as well.

262
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,960
She was your quality time.

263
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Yeah.

264
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
First that's our quality time.

265
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,960
And this conversation came up again.

266
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,960
And then she actually concluded herself, well,

267
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,960
you know, usually all the ugly, stupid,

268
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,960
doorky boys turn out to be the best husband.

269
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
And I said, that's right.

270
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,960
Now go take a look at Dan and Ferguson.

271
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,960
You tell me, boy, that I fuck up with Liam, huh?

272
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Yeah.

273
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,960
But I think she's, she gets very easy bored with, with guys, which is good.

274
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
Yeah, very good.

275
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,960
Yeah, no, because you don't hang, you know, with one.

276
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
Just hang out with one.

277
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
No, she hangs out with one.

278
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Yeah, she has a lot of friends.

279
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Yeah.

280
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,960
So I thought here I was super dad.

281
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,960
And Liam and Christina are in her room.

282
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,960
And I come by and I say, hey, I got a ticket for digital music awards.

283
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,960
So you both can go.

284
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,960
And Christina said, you know,

285
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,960
I really, and you thought, you know,

286
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,960
I thought it was being a great dad.

287
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Look what I'm doing.

288
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
Yeah.

289
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
I'm inviting her boyfriend.

290
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,960
Yeah.

291
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
How cool.

292
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
But she wasn't quite, because she, what did she say to me?

293
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
She said, I want to make sure he goes as my boyfriend.

294
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,960
The notice, you know, some guy who's just looking around

295
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,960
at how to get into the music business.

296
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
I'm going to be in trouble.

297
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
You know that.

298
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
I don't know.

299
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
Because she's going to say that to him.

300
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
She's going to say exactly that.

301
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
Yeah.

302
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
So I'm going to tell him that.

303
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,960
Well, what we didn't know is she was actually.

304
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,960
She already invited one of her friends.

305
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
Cool friends.

306
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
Yeah.

307
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
That was the big mistake.

308
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,960
Yeah.

309
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,960
You didn't know that I haven't heard a talking about it.

310
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
So you thought to do, you know,

311
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,960
I'm doing something cool.

312
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,960
Yeah.

313
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Well, we worked it out.

314
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
Because now we have an extra ticket.

315
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,960
So the entire curry entourage is five people in total.

316
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,960
We're taking a half a table.

317
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,960
They're totally welcome.

318
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Yeah.

319
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
It's kind of interesting.

320
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,960
This digital music awards.

321
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
Yeah.

322
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
Sounds very nice.

323
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,960
I really don't know what to expect.

324
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
I don't know what to expect.

325
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
I don't know what to expect.

326
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,960
I don't know all the names that are performing.

327
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,960
And it's going to be on channel 4.

328
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,960
The airing it after the awards, which I think is a shame.

329
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,960
So the award show is on.

330
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,960
And then I think two weeks later, it airs on channel 4.

331
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
Yeah.

332
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
Isn't that kind of a bar?

333
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Yeah, it's a bummer.

334
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,960
It's not important to know for something.

335
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
I don't know.

336
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
I really don't know.

337
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
I guess not.

338
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Who knows?

339
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
Who knows?

340
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,960
Sometimes it's very hard to get.

341
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
This is the only the second or third year they've done it.

342
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,960
Sometimes it's very hard to get the venue and the broadcast time schedule.

343
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
It's exactly the same moment.

344
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
Okay.

345
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
Sometimes that's hard.

346
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,960
But what we're going to do is we're going to have our own little mini streaming

347
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
studio.

348
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,960
The Grammy is when Ron and I did the Grammy Awards from Los Angeles.

349
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,960
And we know it ever done a cybercast.

350
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,960
Well, maybe someone had.

351
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,960
But I think we were the first ones that did it on that scale.

352
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,960
So we're going to do something very similar.

353
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,960
And we're going to have, I think we have like four cameras, backstage.

354
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
We have four cameras roaming around.

355
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,960
And we're just going to open up a stream.

356
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,960
So you can log in to btpodshow.com.

357
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,960
Are you going team five to start?

358
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,960
Yeah.

359
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,960
No.

360
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
It's even better than that.

361
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,960
After they've done whatever they've got to do.

362
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,960
Then they first walk through the press tent.

363
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
If you will.

364
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
It's not really a tent.

365
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
It's in the press room.

366
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,960
And then they're taken from the press room.

367
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,960
The only way to leave is through our room.

368
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,960
Where we have, so we have all kinds of beautiful people.

369
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,960
Free open bar.

370
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,960
You know that.

371
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,960
That already looks very invite.

372
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,960
Yeah.

373
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
Yeah.

374
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
We're going to light it.

375
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,960
It's going to be.

376
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
Oh, where am I?

377
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
Exactly.

378
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
Oh, this is cool.

379
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,960
We're going to sit everybody down.

380
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,960
So it's going to be.

381
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,960
It's going to be raw.

382
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
I'm sure.

383
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,960
But you know, people will be able to watch on podshow.com.

384
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,960
And just have open window to backstage.

385
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
So that'd be kind of fun.

386
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,960
And you're going to be there.

387
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,960
What do you mean?

388
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
I'm going to be there.

389
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,960
You're going to be there to hang out with them.

390
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Well, you know, I have a very important job.

391
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,960
I've got to smooth with everybody.

392
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,960
I've got to smooth with the British telecom people.

393
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
Of course.

394
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,960
It's going to be there.

395
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,960
We want to sign people, too.

396
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Yeah.

397
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,960
In fact, we're doing kind of like auditions tomorrow.

398
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
Oh, yeah.

399
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,960
Tomorrow.

400
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,960
Tuesday afternoon.

401
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Yeah.

402
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
Where people can come in.

403
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,960
And just, you know, whatever they think they want to do.

404
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
For the show.

405
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
Yeah.

406
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
Very busy.

407
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,960
We have three or four hosts already that we signed up.

408
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
No, it's going to be good.

409
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
Yeah.

410
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
Of course, I'm going to be busy.

411
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,960
What do you think?

412
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,960
It was just going to be more good.

413
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Oh, thank God.

414
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
You daughter is there.

415
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
You're going to be there.

416
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
Yeah.

417
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
We'll be busy running around.

418
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
But that's what it is.

419
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,960
You know, we want to, we'll be producing.

420
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Well, I'm excited.

421
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Yeah.

422
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
I can tell.

423
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
I am.

424
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
I know you didn't listen yesterday.

425
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,960
But this is the, uh, I thought you were going to be on yesterday.

426
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,960
So, for 69 was the episode.

427
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
Swass on Nuff.

428
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Mm-hmm.

429
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
I should have been there.

430
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
You should have.

431
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Hi, Adam and Patricia.

432
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,960
This is Ali from Swingercast.

433
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,960
From Swingercast.

434
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,960
I've been thinking, you know, 69 is always been my favorite number.

435
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,960
But for 69.

436
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
Mm-hmm.

437
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
That's even better.

438
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,960
That's my new favorite number.

439
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,960
That's a hot combo for 69.

440
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,960
That's a proposition.

441
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,960
Don't, that's a proposition.

442
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,960
John tells me you like to have people's in unique pictures.

443
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
Yeah.

444
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Check your mailbox.

445
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,960
Folder or scruncher?

446
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
I guess I'm by.

447
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,960
I do them both.

448
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,960
I fold and scrunch.

449
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
Mm-hmm.

450
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
How about that?

451
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,960
Mm-hmm.

452
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
Do you have the Sierra Charlie number?

453
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,960
What was that?

454
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,960
Well, that was her partner from the Swingercast.

455
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
Oh.

456
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,960
I think they're basically inviting us to go have a 4.69.

457
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:23,960
See, what's so unfair is you've done all that stuff in the 60s and 70s.

458
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
Oh, it's because it's done that.

459
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,960
Because you, yeah, but see, I didn't get to do a lot of that.

460
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,960
Because in the 80s we had like AIDS and death, you know, like 80s.

461
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,960
You're going to die.

462
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,960
No.

463
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,960
The 80s and 90s.

464
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
It was hard.

465
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,960
I don't know that.

466
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,960
There was none of that free love and all that groovy stuff.

467
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,960
Yeah.

468
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
We didn't get any of that.

469
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
What a flower in your hair.

470
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,960
I'll stick a flower in my ass, as long as I can have a group sex.

471
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
Okay.

472
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,960
Okay.

473
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,960
Maybe that guy who called in about his sister-in-law?

474
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
No.

475
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
Yeah, you do.

476
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
Oh.

477
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
The abusive relationship.

478
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,960
Oh, yeah.

479
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
Can we talk to about that?

480
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,960
Yeah.

481
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Yeah.

482
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
Yeah.

483
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
Yeah.

484
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Yeah.

485
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
Yeah.

486
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,960
Yeah.

487
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,960
Let's hear the comments about being with my sister-in-law.

488
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,960
And what I did with your show on Friday.

489
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,960
I made her a listen to it.

490
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,960
And God thought, what happened?

491
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,960
She passed her 3-key bags.

492
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,960
That's incredible.

493
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
God.

494
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
I kind of breaks up at the end, but he says,

495
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,960
She packed her freaking bags and left.

496
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
Uh-huh.

497
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
Yeah.

498
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
So he's helped.

499
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
Yeah.

500
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
We saved it.

501
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,960
We saved two people, I think.

502
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
Uh-huh.

503
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,960
Because you never got to change.

504
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
You could make a career out of it.

505
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Oh, yeah.

506
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
You should do an advice show.

507
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,960
You're really good at that.

508
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,960
Yeah.

509
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,960
You can be fantastic.

510
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,960
Great example.

511
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,960
I'm married to you.

512
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
Uh-huh.

513
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
How are you doing, man?

514
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,960
Uh-huh.

515
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Thank you.

516
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,960
Uh-huh.

517
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,960
You feel much better now.

518
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,960
Yeah.

519
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,960
So I told everybody yesterday that yesterday I played an emo song to start off

520
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,960
the show because I was an emo.

521
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Because we got some horrible news yesterday.

522
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Oh, please.

523
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,960
You know, I can't even be sad about it anymore.

524
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,960
I get an email and phone calls from around the world.

525
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,960
People saying, really, I hope you get a house.

526
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
You know, really sorry.

527
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
Oh, we're so...

528
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,960
I mean, look at the quality of the problem.

529
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,960
Yeah.

530
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,960
You first of all, this is not a horrible thing.

531
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,960
But can you believe that of all the houses we pick?

532
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,960
Let's say we feel very lucky.

533
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
Oh, we're very thankful.

534
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,960
Very lucky.

535
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,960
Every day we wake up and open our eyes and we're still alive.

536
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
Very lucky.

537
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
Yeah.

538
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Yes.

539
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,960
Now, fuck this shit about the goddamn covenant.

540
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,960
Oh, this is me off.

541
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
Yeah.

542
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
So we haven't...

543
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,960
I'm a little worried because I haven't heard back from the real estate agent yesterday.

544
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
Yesterday.

545
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,960
It's very quiet.

546
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,960
Yeah.

547
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,960
So it's too quiet.

548
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,960
Definitely.

549
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,960
Yeah.

550
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,960
Well, I did kind of yesterday.

551
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,960
Oh, you did.

552
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
Yeah.

553
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,960
There's a covenant which means you cannot convert the garage,

554
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,960
which the house is almost perfect for us.

555
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,960
If only we could have the kitchen in a different spot and make the current kitchen.

556
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
Yeah.

557
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
Which is perfect.

558
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,960
Yeah.

559
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Because, you know, we've agreed that we really want to spend the most of attention

560
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,960
to the places where we are the most in our lives.

561
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,960
Which is the kitchen, which is the bedroom.

562
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
And you.

563
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,960
And the bathroom.

564
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,960
No, no.

565
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,960
You know, I don't really give a shit.

566
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
I mean, just give me...

567
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
Yeah.

568
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,960
I'm willing to sit out in the garden.

569
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,960
Yes, you know.

570
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,960
That's fine.

571
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,960
I don't care.

572
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,960
But so the garage, the garage,

573
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,960
cannot be converted.

574
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
I'm going to figure out this covenant.

575
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,960
At least the seller, the vendor.

576
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Well, because it wasn't figured out.

577
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,960
They came up with the covenant 30 years ago.

578
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
Yeah.

579
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
I don't know why.

580
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,960
But I think a covenant...

581
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,960
There must have been a reason.

582
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
Yeah.

583
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,960
But to me, a covenant is pretty much a legal agreement that you can't...

584
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
Yeah.

585
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
But they must have...

586
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
I want to hear the reason.

587
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
Yeah.

588
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,960
I'm very curious about the reason.

589
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Because these days, people want to do something with any space they have

590
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,960
with their houses.

591
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,960
And, you know, we don't drive our cars in the garage anymore.

592
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,960
No.

593
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,960
Because we're in a hurry.

594
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
Well, there's...

595
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
Obviously some reason.

596
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,960
And if we find out the reason, maybe we can turn the covenant back.

597
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,960
I don't know if it's for all of the houses or just that one on that particular road.

598
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,960
But, you know, it's so messed up.

599
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
Because you get everything all geared up.

600
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
You get lawyers and everyone's involved.

601
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
Everybody's already going.

602
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
Everyone's ready to rock.

603
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,960
And I gotta leave in a week.

604
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,960
You know, it's like...

605
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,960
Yeah.

606
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
And then what?

607
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
Then we're...

608
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,960
If nothing happens, I'm going to be gone for two weeks.

609
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,960
What can I do in the two weeks time?

610
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,960
Telephone calls.

611
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Yeah.

612
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,960
I think we want to start looking again.

613
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
No.

614
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
We'll just wait.

615
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,960
Wait until we got some answers.

616
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,960
And then I'm just going to switch my...

617
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,960
You know, my house knob.

618
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,960
I thought I was your house knob.

619
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,960
Because I don't think about it yet.

620
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
Okay.

621
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
We love here.

622
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
Because we were very happy with house.

623
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,960
Yeah, well.

624
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,960
I've also switched to neutral baby.

625
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,960
I'm like, okay, whatever.

626
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,960
But, you know, I hope something...

627
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,960
You know, it's going to be so fucking busy.

628
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
It's going to be next week.

629
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,960
Everyone in town, I mean, I'm not a lot of bandwidth to do much.

630
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,960
So they, you know, Bruce Bruce Simon.

631
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,960
He's got to really fix it.

632
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
Yeah.

633
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
You know, figure it out.

634
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,960
I know.

635
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,960
But there's nothing we can do anyway.

636
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
It's frustrating.

637
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,960
See, I get all flush and I get all sweaty when I think about it.

638
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
Yeah, it's kind of harsh.

639
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
But people remember the phone number when I play that.

640
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,960
Plus one two one six two five six three five seven four.

641
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,960
The New Jersey number in London.

642
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,960
Oh, two oh seven six eight one three seven five three.

643
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,960
Yeah, Christina show is out.

644
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,960
The BG blast.

645
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
Oh yeah.

646
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
Let's just do it with Martina and Shme.

647
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
Okay.

648
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,960
You want to hear something incredible?

649
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
Yeah.

650
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
Listen to the promo.

651
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
Then tell me this is not...

652
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
She is not my daughter.

653
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
I mean, let's see this.

654
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
Okay.

655
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
Hey there.

656
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
I'm Christina Curry.

657
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
One of the hosts of the BG blast.

658
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,960
Be sure to tune into this week's episode where I showcase new music by Melo Bright Van.

659
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
Sean J and more.

660
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,960
Listen to hear about the exciting how low-screen promotion where one lucky listener will get a free trip to Bush Gardens.

661
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,960
We even learn about hippo camps.

662
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,960
And I share the star in my most recent drama in the dressing room of London's top shop clinic store.

663
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,960
Toon in this week and check it out.

664
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,960
What do you think?

665
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,960
She sounds a little bit higher.

666
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,960
I think I think the whole spot was spun up a little bit.

667
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
Yeah.

668
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,960
Just a little bit.

669
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
But do you hear the puke and quality she has?

670
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,960
She's really cute.

671
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
She does.

672
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,960
I'm just waiting for to say everybody.

673
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
Toon in there and everybody.

674
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
Yeah.

675
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,960
Very cute.

676
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,960
Good timing.

677
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,960
Yeah.

678
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
But she sounds a little bit lower.

679
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,960
I know.

680
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
She does.

681
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,960
Yeah.

682
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
But it's the high tempo height.

683
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,960
More teenager.

684
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,960
They needed more teenager.

685
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,960
No.

686
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
I think that the music was so long.

687
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,960
And they had to squeeze her track into it something like that.

688
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
Wow.

689
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,960
She likes that.

690
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,960
Well, that's Dr. Dave.

691
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,960
Dave Fox.

692
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,960
He's putting the show together.

693
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
He's a profession.

694
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,960
He sure is a profession.

695
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
Yeah.

696
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
What else you got, baby?

697
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,960
Anything else you want to talk about?

698
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
Well, I was just.

699
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,960
I said it this morning when I read the paper about that judge here.

700
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Yeah.

701
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:31,960
So there's two judges who had it in a fair together and they had the same housekeeper.

702
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,960
And I think they were both screwing the housekeeper.

703
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,960
It was his housekeeper, I think.

704
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
But it wasn't she having sex with her as well.

705
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
I think he had sex in the beginning with her.

706
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
Yeah.

707
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,960
But didn't.

708
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
So she probably was jealous.

709
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
Yeah.

710
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,960
She had made video or stole video.

711
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,960
So he had the two judges, male and female.

712
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,960
See, that's having sex in the end.

713
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,960
Let me finish.

714
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
Let me finish it.

715
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
Let me finish it.

716
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,960
Okay.

717
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,960
Yeah.

718
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,960
People didn't read the fucking story.

719
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
This is a UK story.

720
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,960
Only when America don't understand.

721
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
Then you just.

722
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,960
I know, I know your point.

723
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,960
Just let me.

724
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
Yeah.

725
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,960
Ready?

726
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
Yeah.

727
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,960
Yeah.

728
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,960
So the two judges that was video tape of them having

729
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,960
sex and doing coke.

730
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,960
Doing coke.

731
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,960
I didn't hear that.

732
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,960
Well, why don't you read the paper?

733
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,960
Oh, it's in there.

734
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,960
I must have missed something.

735
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,960
That was, that's the big deal.

736
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
That's the coke part.

737
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,960
And so she then blasted.

738
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,960
And she was here illegally.

739
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,960
Because her visa ran out.

740
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,960
Yeah.

741
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
And then she blackmailed.

742
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
Yeah.

743
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,960
The judge for 20,000 pounds.

744
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,960
Otherwise, she'd release the video tape.

745
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
Yeah.

746
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,960
And so that.

747
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,960
So they sued her for blackmail.

748
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,960
Or she was charged on blackmail charges.

749
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,960
And now, of course, the question is, how about these judges?

750
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,960
Are they fit to be judges?

751
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
And 20,000.

752
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,960
It's not enough.

753
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,960
That was stupid.

754
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
She should be thrown in jail for being idiot.

755
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
Idiot.

756
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
Yeah.

757
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,960
She's done it like that.

758
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
Now you're pointing about taping yourself.

759
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,960
Well, dude, that's what I said.

760
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,960
And I said it to you once.

761
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,960
Because you said a couple of months ago.

762
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,960
You wanted to tape something or I don't know.

763
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Or should we?

764
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
What?

765
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,960
Ask me to tape it.

766
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
Or I'll try 15 years ago.

767
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,960
15 years ago.

768
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,960
And every year, every year, maybe you're asking a show show.

769
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,960
That is so not true.

770
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,960
Because I know that I look horrible naked.

771
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,960
I mean, I'll tape you.

772
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,960
But I'm not going to tape me.

773
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,960
Are you nuts?

774
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
But I always say it's like, no.

775
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
Faces of death far free.

776
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,960
If it's my husband for 20 years or anything,

777
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,960
I would never ever do that.

778
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,960
Because you never know who finds notes.

779
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,960
But that's part of doing it.

780
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,960
Is the excitement of knowing that you have this illegal thing.

781
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,960
That if it got out, it could destroy you.

782
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,960
Yes.

783
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,960
Yes.

784
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,960
Look, you can become a really big star.

785
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
Yes.

786
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
You can be a little bit.

787
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,960
Look at Perisilta.

788
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,960
Look at Perisilta.

789
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
Absolutely.

790
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,960
I think Pamela Anderson didn't hurt her either.

791
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,960
After we all saw Tommy's trauma.

792
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,960
I think.

793
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
Yeah.

794
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,960
That's what I'm doing.

795
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,960
That thing is enormous.

796
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,960
He was the starring there.

797
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
Well, that's what I mean.

798
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,960
So if you have, if you have that kind of penis.

799
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
Oh, you shared.

800
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
I think you shared.

801
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,960
I think that's your obligation to mankind to make a video.

802
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,960
I've seen this whole thing.

803
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,960
He's steering the boat with his dick.

804
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
Ah.

805
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
And he's honking the horn.

806
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
Oh, no, I'm with it.

807
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
It's amazing.

808
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
And for Pammy.

809
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
For Pammy.

810
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,960
It is big.

811
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,960
You know that I've never seen it.

812
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,960
But I've, there was a program on me.

813
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
Believe me.

814
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
Believe me.

815
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,960
And actually, I had a glimpse.

816
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,960
A glimpse.

817
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
And then I couldn't believe it.

818
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,960
They can't show that on English TV.

819
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,960
No.

820
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
I can't show it.

821
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
You see the little bit of penis.

822
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,960
And I couldn't believe it.

823
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
Yeah.

824
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,960
So yeah.

825
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,960
Then you should tape it.

826
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,960
Yeah.

827
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,960
I point exactly.

828
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,960
And he was right to sell it.

829
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,960
But I would never do that.

830
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
Well, that's a shame.

831
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,960
No, because I'm such a smock.

832
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,960
Oh, you're such a white.

833
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
A smock.

834
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,960
Somebody will find it.

835
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
Yeah, you're right.

836
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,960
Yeah.

837
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,960
Well, but, you know, we've exposed ourselves on television.

838
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
Yeah.

839
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
Yeah.

840
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,960
But we, you know, we checked it.

841
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
And it was okay.

842
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
Yeah.

843
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
Certainly was okay.

844
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
Yeah.

845
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,960
I thought what, what actually fluked out and escaped of my penis.

846
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,960
Yeah.

847
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,960
You know, no one said, hey, Adam's got a small penis.

848
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
Right?

849
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
Everybody was angry.

850
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
Lots of men were angry.

851
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
Very angry.

852
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,960
Very angry.

853
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,960
Yeah.

854
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Yeah.

855
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
I know.

856
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,960
Because they were jealous.

857
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
I guess.

858
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,960
Yeah.

859
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,960
And see, this is my point.

860
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
It's like, I'm like, man, all right.

861
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
It's okay.

862
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
That's good.

863
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,960
You can Google Adam's penis.

864
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,960
And it'll probably show up.

865
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,960
Oh, God.

866
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,960
You'll need to expand your browser.

867
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,960
Hey.

868
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,960
Now you did it.

869
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,960
That's been seen so many times before.

870
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,960
Yeah.

871
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,960
I really don't care.

872
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,960
I wish we could put, I investigated if we could put out the Adam's family.

873
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,960
Yeah.

874
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,960
Very difficult because of all the music we used.

875
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
Oh.

876
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,960
Yeah.

877
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,960
You can't make it available for a download.

878
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,960
Oh.

879
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,960
Yeah.

880
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Because we use all kinds of hits and every greens and stuff like that.

881
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,960
And it's a nightmare to license.

882
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Oh, shit.

883
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,960
Sox doesn't it?

884
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,960
But we could put it on the stream.

885
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,960
If we had a live stream, then we could do it.

886
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,960
What is that?

887
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,960
I mean, you can't download it.

888
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,960
But you can only watch it at a certain time.

889
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,960
Or it has to be streaming.

890
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
Yeah.

891
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
There's all different laws for that.

892
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,960
Yeah.

893
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,960
You could do that.

894
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,960
But I want to sponsor.

895
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,960
Yeah.

896
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,960
Because you probably need to pay for it anyway because you're using the music.

897
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,960
Well, yeah.

898
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,960
If you have a stream, like we'll have that at the digital music awards.

899
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,960
Yeah.

900
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,960
There will be all kinds of music licensed music as well.

901
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,960
But with streaming, you can pay Ask Cat BMI because you can't download it.

902
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,960
So there's no other organization.

903
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
The record companies can't do anything.

904
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,960
You do have to pay Ask Cat BMI, which is okay.

905
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,960
Yeah.

906
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,960
I don't want paying for it.

907
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,960
So I don't know who to pay.

908
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,960
But then if people want to watch the Adams family, they have to pay then.

909
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,960
No, we could do it anyway.

910
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,960
We want.

911
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,960
We could have it sponsored.

912
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,960
You get a sponsor.

913
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,960
That's what I mean.

914
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,960
Yeah.

915
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,960
So indirectly people are paying, of course, because there's a sponsored message.

916
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,960
Or yeah, you could draw.

917
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,960
I don't know if any.

918
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,960
You know, I don't believe in the pay.

919
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,960
You know, a dollar 99.

920
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,960
I just hate it.

921
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,960
I don't know.

922
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,960
I don't like it.

923
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
You know.

924
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,960
I'm not in custody anyway.

925
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,960
Yeah.

926
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
I'm just not interested.

927
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,960
I'd like I wish more people could see it.

928
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,960
Yeah.

929
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,960
Rather than making.

930
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,960
Made potentially more money by restricting it.

931
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,960
And then, you know, you got a copy right protected.

932
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,960
So so people.

933
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,960
Yeah.

934
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Yeah.

935
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Fuck it.

936
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,960
My sister was watching it with.

937
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,960
With her daughter and her new friend.

938
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
She was watching the DVD.

939
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,960
Her partner.

940
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
Yeah.

941
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,960
And they were watching it again.

942
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,960
And then she said it was very funny.

943
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,960
It was a funny thing.

944
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,960
It was a funny thing.

945
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
Better when you watch it now.

946
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,960
And it's Christina was so much smaller.

947
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,960
Yeah.

948
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,960
Yeah.

949
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,960
And there's a lot of English in it too.

950
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,960
Yeah.

951
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,960
So it could be pretty international thing.

952
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,960
I mean, it's not hard to understand that you're based on watching your life.

953
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
No.

954
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
No.

955
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,960
You actually have to see it.

956
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
And you will understand it.

957
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
Yeah.

958
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,960
So would you consider that?

959
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,960
You being the co-co-executive producer?

960
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,960
Yeah.

961
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
You put it on the pod chest.

962
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
No.

963
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
That might be fun.

964
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,960
Yeah.

965
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,960
Because it's a pity.

966
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
It's just laying you.

967
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
Yeah.

968
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,960
I mean, even if we didn't make any money.

969
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
I have to think of it.

970
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,960
You know.

971
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,960
I mean, we are naked here in there.

972
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,460
Yeah.

973
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,460
Hopefully.

974
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,460
Now, I like that.

975
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,460
I like having a historical record of my nakedness when it still was okay.

976
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,460
Hmm.

977
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,460
Don't you think?

978
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,460
Don't you love having your playboy picture?

979
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,460
Oh, yeah.

980
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,460
Oh, yeah.

981
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,460
Yeah.

982
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,460
Been in there for a couple of times.

983
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,460
And.

984
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,460
But isn't it nice to have that to look back at?

985
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,460
Yeah.

986
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,460
Especially.

987
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,460
Well, you actually look at it.

988
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,460
Like, I don't look like that anymore.

989
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,460
That's a pity.

990
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,460
But it's photoshoot.

991
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,460
Yeah.

992
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,460
It's pretty.

993
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,460
Layout and lighting.

994
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,460
Yeah.

995
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,460
A million of those shoots today.

996
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,460
Well, no, the days that in the days that I did it, we didn't photoshop.

997
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,460
Get airbrush.

998
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,460
Not, not even the first one.

999
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,460
The first one.

1000
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,460
First one was nothing done.

1001
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,460
Untouched.

1002
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,460
It was all lighting, wasn't it?

1003
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,460
Untouched.

1004
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,460
You have to do it with light.

1005
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,460
Yeah.

1006
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,460
These days for photographers just put you in front of a screen.

1007
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,460
Change the background.

1008
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,460
Oh, they can make me look like 16 year old.

1009
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,460
Yeah.

1010
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,460
I mean, it's enough fair.

1011
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,460
Cool.

1012
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,460
It's not fair.

1013
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,460
That was not fair.

1014
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,460
You know, this is not real.

1015
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,460
All right.

1016
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:26,460
I'm going to play a song that is nominated for the Digital Music Awards, which is now available on the podcast music network.

1017
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,460
Mm.

1018
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,460
Okay.

1019
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,460
I don't think it's going to be your style.

1020
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,460
It's in the electronic category.

1021
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,460
Okay.

1022
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,460
So you may not like it.

1023
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,460
Who is it again?

1024
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,460
The future.

1025
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,460
That's right.

1026
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,460
This dream is a beautiful night.

1027
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:59,460
Yeah.

1028
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:07,460
The falling sun, the faded light, the rolling ground, different sky.

1029
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,460
Yeah.

1030
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:13,460
I'm going to slide, because I'm good.

1031
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:17,460
I think I might go mad instead.

1032
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:22,460
It's a dream is a beautiful night.

1033
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,460
Yeah.

1034
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,460
Oh, the sun is shining.

1035
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,460
Yeah.

1036
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,460
It's a dream is a beautiful night.

1037
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,460
It's a beautiful night.

1038
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:43,460
It's a beautiful night.

1039
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:51,460
It's a beautiful night.

1040
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,460
It's what it seems.

1041
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,460
The smoking done.

1042
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:00,460
The second chance has just ruined.

1043
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:09,460
The second chance has just ruined.

1044
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:14,460
This dream is a beautiful night.

1045
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,460
Oh, the sun is shining.

1046
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:22,460
It's a beautiful night.

1047
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,460
It's a beautiful night.

1048
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:29,460
This dream is a beautiful night.

1049
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:35,460
Oh, my man, oh, so good night

1050
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:41,460
Just feels like a bullet from nowhere

1051
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,460
And so good night

1052
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:49,460
This dream is a beautiful night night

1053
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:53,460
Oh, so good night

1054
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,460
Just feels like a bullet from nowhere

1055
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,460
And so good night night

1056
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:06,460
This dream is a beautiful night night

1057
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:10,460
Oh, so good night

1058
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:15,460
Just feels like a bullet from nowhere

1059
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,460
And so good night night

1060
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:24,460
Insight has a physical meaning

1061
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:27,460
And it drives me insane

1062
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:32,460
Too blind to be up to my fear

1063
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,460
Such a feeling for pain

1064
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:41,460
Insight has a physical meaning

1065
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,460
And it drives me insane

1066
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:50,460
Too blind to be up to my fear

1067
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,460
Such a feeling for pain

1068
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:30,460
It's called a bullet from nowhere

1069
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,460
The future

1070
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,460
Nominated in the best unsigned band category

1071
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,460
For the channel for BT Digital Music Awards

1072
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,460
London October 3rd

1073
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:47,460
Beyond the lookout for live video at podshow.com

1074
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,460
I liked it

1075
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,460
It's not bad, isn't it?

1076
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:55,460
It's very interesting how they made one of the harmonies

1077
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,460
Became the melody

1078
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,460
Yeah

1079
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,460
Like I know what the fuck you're talking about

1080
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,460
But I can imagine where that bass line

1081
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,460
We're pretty good in the club

1082
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,460
That's actually the harmony

1083
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,460
And that bass line

1084
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,460
Right?

1085
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,460
I liked it

1086
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,460
So I guess they'll play

1087
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,460
I'm not quite sure, I don't know who's coming

1088
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,460
Oh, I know who's also name

1089
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,460
You're going to laugh

1090
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,460
Sandy Tom

1091
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,460
I wish I was a punk rocker

1092
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,460
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

1093
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,460
Doesn't she play all that shit herself all the instruments?

1094
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,460
No, that's not her

1095
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,460
Well, maybe it's not her that

1096
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,460
I thought that she was coming

1097
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,460
Oh, yeah

1098
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,460
Yeah, I think so

1099
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,460
I think she's performing

1100
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,460
So as you noticed, I was planning on being out here

1101
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,460
Out of here by noon, it's almost one

1102
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,460
Yeah

1103
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,460
The reason being

1104
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,460
After a year and a half of

1105
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,460
Telling Ron that he should try

1106
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,460
Virgin upper class

1107
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,460
Instead of he always flies American airways

1108
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,460
Or British airways

1109
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,460
So they decided to do Virgin

1110
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,460
Yeah

1111
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,460
And there was a

1112
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,460
Mechanical difficulty

1113
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,460
Oh no

1114
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,460
And they had to go to

1115
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,460
They had to go to LA

1116
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,460
And then from LA to London

1117
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,460
So they're not rising until 3.30

1118
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,460
And you would you great idea

1119
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,460
I've never had a problem with a Virgin

1120
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,460
Never, never heard

1121
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,460
What do I say when I come back

1122
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,460
What do I always say?

1123
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,460
About a problem, never

1124
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,460
No, what do I say?

1125
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,460
I love that airline

1126
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,460
I love it

1127
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,460

1128
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,460
Oh

1129
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,460
Isn't that always like that?

1130
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,460
Mm-hmm

1131
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,460
There you go

1132
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,460
Oh my god

1133
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,460
So I won't see you until tomorrow

1134
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,460
But they will be comfortable

1135
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,460
And later

1136
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,460
Yeah, they'll be comfortably laid

1137
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,460

1138
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,460
