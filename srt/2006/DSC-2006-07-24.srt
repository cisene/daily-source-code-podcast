Delta Sierra Charlie, 426.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,080
We have clearance clearance.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
Roger, Roger.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,080
What's our vector, Victor?

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,080
How are radio clearance over?

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
That's clearance over.

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,080
Over.

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,080
Roger.

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,080
Not with $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,080
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,080
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,080
Fantastic.

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,080
It's Adam Curry.

17
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,080
Heavenly Liberty Jones.

18
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:56,080
Works in the shop that she owns.

19
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,480
This is to music like swing.

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:13,880
When there's no customers in, just because she don't like to drive, takes us to see a step

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,880
flying.

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,880
And these are thoughts outside.

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,880
To the river at night.

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,880
This is your so-fi.

25
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,880
Why don't you come for me?

26
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,880
Take me away from my face.

27
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,880
This is your so-fi.

28
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,880
I wish you would buy.

29
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,880
We could go mad.

30
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,880
Back to my face.

31
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,880
This is your so-fi.

32
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,880
Why don't you come for me?

33
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,880
Take me away from my face.

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
Oh!

35
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:21,880
She's gotta keep an eye.

36
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,880
There's a name word in black.

37
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,880
If things are lonely, desire.

38
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,880
Give it to yours, don't think.

39
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,880
Why don't you come for me?

40
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,880
Take me away from my face.

41
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,880
This is your so-fi.

42
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,880
I wish you would buy.

43
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,880
We could go mad.

44
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,880
Back to my face.

45
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,880
This is your so-fi.

46
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,880
Why don't you come for me?

47
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,880
Take me away from my face.

48
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:22,880
This is your so-fi.

49
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,880
I wish you would buy.

50
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,880
Why don't you come for me?

51
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,880
Take me away from my face.

52
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,880
Why don't you come for me?

53
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,880
Take me away from my face.

54
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,880
This is your so-fi.

55
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,880
Take me away from my face.

56
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,880
Why don't you come for me?

57
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,880
This is your so-fi.

58
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:13,880
This is your so-fi.

59
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:20,880
You know, when I heard that pop up on the pod save music network, I went, oh my gosh.

60
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
This is like 60's.

61
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
I love it.

62
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,880
The shakes.

63
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,880
Liberty Jones released exclusively to the pod save music network.

64
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,880
It'll be in stores October 9th, 2006 from the UK.

65
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,880
This is at the shakes and Liberty Jones.

66
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
Hey everybody, good morning.

67
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
How you doing?

68
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,880
Coming to you from the Curry condo and San Francisco.

69
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,880
It's a really weird day today.

70
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,880
The sun is already out in a shining.

71
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,880
It's 6.30 in the morning.

72
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,880
As you know, when I'm on the west coast, I got to get up early to satisfy all the peeps with the shell.

73
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,880
And so we've got sun coming over the bay and then over the mountains.

74
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,880
Literally we have convection fog, which is just rolling in.

75
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,880
It's like the weirdest tube.

76
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,880
It's almost like opposite sides of nature trying to come together.

77
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,880
Pretty much right around the 24th floor where I am here in the condo.

78
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,880
Brand new setup.

79
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,880
You may hear some differences in the sound.

80
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,880
Not so much that the electronics have changed.

81
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:20,880
But do you remember I was talking about a Patricia and I went to JC Penny to go buy furniture?

82
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
No, it wasn't JC Penny.

83
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
I was levits.

84
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
That's what it was.

85
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,880
Levits.

86
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,880
And then yeah, it's what we ordered table and chairs and all the stuff to complete the condo.

87
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,880
Because I was pretty much still living on the couch.

88
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,880
And right on the delivery date, which I think was the last time I was here in San Francisco.

89
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
They called.

90
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
They didn't call.

91
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
I had to call them.

92
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
Oh, well, it's out of stock.

93
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
It'll be there.

94
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,880
You know, third week of July, whatever.

95
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,880
And this was in June.

96
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,880
I was like, no, you promised me it would be here.

97
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Cancel the order.

98
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,880
So they canceled the order.

99
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,880
As far as I can recall, and I'll have to look it up again.

100
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,880
But that can happen to like a back home.

101
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
They refunded my money.

102
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,880
I know they took my credit card information.

103
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,880
They refunded my money.

104
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
And then guess what happened?

105
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,880
I got a phone call on Friday from the building manager.

106
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,880
Oh, your furniture has been delivered.

107
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,880
It's here in storage.

108
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,880
Just let us know when you want to bring it up.

109
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
I'm like furniture.

110
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
What are you talking about?

111
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,880
Yes, they're so fucked up that they actually delivered the furniture after having paid me the money back.

112
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,880
And I don't feel very compelled at this point to tell them they did so.

113
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
So I've got to, I've got a great new table.

114
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,880
I've got the chairs, but most importantly, the thing I was really waiting for was

115
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,880
the Baker's rack.

116
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
I needed a studio set-up.

117
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,880
Something that would be better than using the bar of the kitchen.

118
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,880
And Patricia and I had found this Baker's rack.

119
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,880
Which, of course, matches the table just beautifully.

120
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,880
She was with me, right?

121
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,880
And so, well, it is almost perfect.

122
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
In fact.

123
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
So I've got three levels here.

124
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
I've got Mixer and everything set up on the lowest level.

125
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
The middle level.

126
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,880
I've got the laptop.

127
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,880
Top level is here.

128
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
You can hear it.

129
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,880
I'm hitting the rack.

130
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,880
Top level is where the mic is hooked up.

131
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,880
And I really should take a picture of this sheet on my camera.

132
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,880
I'll take a picture.

133
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,880
Then around the corner from where I have the Baker's rack,

134
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
I have a flat screen.

135
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,880
And I figured out that I could actually any time one of those

136
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
folding arms that comes out from the wall.

137
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,880
So now I'm able to fold it out and move it around.

138
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,880
So it is, I do need to take a picture.

139
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,880
I can never, never explain to you how this is working.

140
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,880
But believe me, now I have hooked up the flat screen

141
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,880
in addition to the laptop that I've got running.

142
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,880
And so I've got cast blasted on the big screen.

143
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,880
And it's like a huge extended work workspace.

144
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,880
It's almost perfect.

145
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,880
It feels so studio-like.

146
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,880
It's perfect.

147
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,880
Now I just have to get a set up here that is permanent.

148
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,880
So I don't have to bring stuff,

149
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,880
or you know, lug stuff across international date lines.

150
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,880
Still hot in the UK.

151
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,880
Of course, I've been talking to the girls back home.

152
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,880
But man, it's like a heat wave everywhere.

153
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,880
111 degrees outside of San Francisco up to 115

154
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,880
and some of the towns out the valley.

155
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
It's just unbelievable.

156
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,880
A Saturday, I was like, you know, finally I slept, right?

157
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,880
I was so happy to just sleep in.

158
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,880
So I got up at, wow, 10 o'clock.

159
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,880
Unbelievable.

160
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,880
I was like, okay, I got to go ahead and get some air,

161
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,880
do some errands, get some, you know, some essentials

162
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
for the condo.

163
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,880
Oh man, it was like 98 degrees outside.

164
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,880
It was just, I think there's something to this

165
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,880
to this global warming.

166
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,880
You know, I don't think it's at funny anymore.

167
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,880
What's going to, is this going to be worse

168
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,880
in 10 years from now, even worse in 20 years from now?

169
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
It really seems like there's something to all

170
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
this inconvenient truth from Al Gore.

171
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,880
I wish though that he would, he would explain a little bit more

172
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,880
about how we can change this.

173
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,880
And clearly the only way to really change these things

174
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,880
is to vote people in the office who will make the change.

175
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,880
It's, it's so funny how I think in modern day

176
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,880
we've become so jaded by, you know,

177
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,880
and I, more and more people I hear them say,

178
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
you know, what difference does it make?

179
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
If I vote for this guy, I vote for that guy.

180
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
You know what?

181
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
It does make a difference.

182
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
It really, really does.

183
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,880
Okay.

184
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,880
We're not, we're not at elections right now.

185
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,880
I'll, I'll get on that tangent when it's time.

186
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,880
Exciting things going on back in, in the UK.

187
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,880
All weekend long Patricia Christina and I have been

188
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,880
talking about a new cottage that has been located.

189
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,880
As you know, since Alex used me.

190
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,880
This sincere moment brought to you by the,

191
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,880
I wrote it down too.

192
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
Forget about it.

193
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,880
It's not brought to you by anybody.

194
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,880
It's brought to you by myself.

195
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
All weekend long we've been looking at a house

196
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,880
that the Patricia and Christina found.

197
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,880
It's, it's, it's in, for all tense and purposes,

198
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,880
it seems absolutely perfect.

199
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,880
So as we speak Patricia and Christina are there with,

200
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,880
with Mark, he's the guy that's been,

201
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,880
he's been helping us out.

202
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,880
He helped us out with this house and,

203
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,880
and has been helping us evaluate property and,

204
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,880
and just knows a little bit more about the English property market.

205
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,880
And they're trying to acquire it.

206
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,880
I have not even been near the house personally.

207
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,880
I've only seen it in pictures, but I trust my wife.

208
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,880
I trust her when she says this is it that that's going to be it.

209
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,880
So who knows?

210
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,880
By tomorrow we could be owners of a brand new cottage.

211
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,880
I met Matt from the Dave and Matt Show.

212
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,880
Catching up on a few Charlie says her late and was amazed to find

213
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,880
this topic of folding and scrunching.

214
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,880
I had no idea that there were so many scrunchers.

215
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,880
In fact, I wasn't even aware of the world of scrunching.

216
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Me being from a world of folding.

217
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,880
Well, I had caught my five-year-old daughter scrunching her toy

218
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,880
the paper so I quickly corrected her for her to become a folder,

219
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
not knowing that there were so many scrunchers out there.

220
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
And how do you do that?

221
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,880
How do you correct your child if she's scrunching?

222
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,880
And you need to get her to fold?

223
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
I am still amazed.

224
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,880
Now, I'd lean off on the Dave and Matt Show.

225
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
We've had a segment devoted to such topics like this.

226
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,880
And that segment is called bathroom oddities.

227
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,880
Here's the thing, too.

228
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,880
And I'm sure the topic of folding and scrunching

229
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,880
will blend in very nicely to bathroom oddities on our next show.

230
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,880
Anyway, I hope you're enjoying your vacation in Euro Disney

231
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,880
and that you're not getting a lot of flag from the French.

232
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,880
The Lizzy French Bastels.

233
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,880
No, not in Euro Disney just yet.

234
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,880
Thanks, Matt.

235
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,880
In San Francisco, we're supposed to go the third and fourth of August.

236
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,880
We're going to go for like two nights, three days, whatever it is.

237
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,880
But we've not booked it yet because we're not sure, you know,

238
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,880
if I get back and then that whole week I have to take care of

239
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,880
purchasing a cottage, then maybe not a good idea.

240
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,880
We're definitely going to go because, man, I'd love to just get away

241
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,880
for a bit with the girls.

242
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,880
And I had officially retired the whole folding and scruncher thing.

243
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,880
But there's just so much interest for it.

244
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,880
And not just from people calling in to tell me if their folders are scrunchers.

245
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,880
No, there's artistic value in this as well, you see.

246
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,880
One once asked for a role of toilet paper.

247
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,880
I had some extra, so I gladly gave.

248
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,880
And then much to my surprise.

249
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,880
The fellow looked me in the eyes and asked me,

250
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
should I fold it or scrunch it in a ball?

251
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,880
And I promptly and most certainly said.

252
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,880
If you scrunch it or fold it, I don't really want to know it.

253
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,880
What works for you is not for me to know.

254
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,880
A fellow needs some air when dealing down there.

255
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,880
So let me leave you be in your commode.

256
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,880
If you fold it or scrunch it, I have a sinking hunch

257
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,880
that it would do the bloody job well either way.

258
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,880
For I know it's not my place.

259
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
I'd never rub it in his face.

260
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,880
All the private details of my toiletry.

261
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,880
But at least I'm glad to think we don't do it in the sink.

262
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,880
In short, that may well lead to anarchy.

263
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,880
So scrunch it or fold it.

264
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,880
Everybody knows that it will do the bloody job well either way.

265
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,880
So don't spend your honest wage on some fancy old bedake

266
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,880
because you know where it will end.

267
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
So use it well, my friend.

268
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
Scrunch and fold it anyway.

269
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Your breeze.

270
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,880
Yeah.

271
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,880
The fabulous Jeff Smith does it again.

272
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,880
I love it when Jeff just keys into something

273
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
that people are digging and it will create

274
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
some kind of song or jingle or something about.

275
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Thank you very much.

276
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,880
The Jeff Smith dot com GOFF for the Jeff.

277
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,880
Oh, and it doesn't stop there.

278
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,880
I had them.

279
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,880
Hello.

280
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,880
I passenger was here, there was.

281
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
And when the copy was skipped.

282
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,880
I crying.

283
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,880
Don't Hey.

284
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,920
Hi the red bowl, you know you can see the water falling from

285
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,880
a 1971 here from San Francisco currently in London.

286
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,920
� just one thing hello.

287
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,880
And wish you guys a good day and while not.

288
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Have fun in San Francisco. I live there. I really enjoy it.

289
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:25,680
I have a folder, it's not something I would admit, readily but it's true and I think

290
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:33,240
that, you know, it doesn't matter because hey, people who care don't mind knowing because

291
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,980
they already know and people who don't know me don't matter.

292
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:45,820
Now about the, about the conflict in Lebanon, there is no basis for Israel or

293
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,660
all right.

294
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,020
Hold on a second before you get into that.

295
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,700
Okay, so folding scrunching.

296
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,940
Is this something that we should teach our children from a very young age?

297
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,740
When we toy the train our children should we not immediately start and get them into the

298
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,180
folding way of things, isn't that the true way of life?

299
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,580
I mean, come on, let's be honest here, folding is just, it just makes you feel better, it's

300
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:15,060
more humane, we're walking upright, we shouldn't be scrunching, we should be folding.

301
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:22,060
I checked out the Blarmcast, I was the girl who sent in a message, I think that was when

302
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,780
the last show Patricia and I did and I'll put a link to the show, you've got to listen

303
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:32,420
to this show and she said in her original audio comment that she loved talking about poop

304
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:37,620
on her show and that that's not just a guy thing, it's also for girls and I was laughing

305
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,580
my ass off when I heard this episode.

306
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:50,340
She went so deep into several different topics, just to use a metaphor, it was absolutely

307
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,180
astounding, it's too long for me to play on the Charlie, but you've got to listen to

308
00:15:54,180 --> 00:16:00,060
it, it's outrageous and she actually broachs a whole new topic which is not just about

309
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:05,940
folding or scrunching but about looking or not looking and the benefits to that.

310
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,900
I'll back to Hassan because he was about to say something interesting, I believe.

311
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:15,420
Anyone else that can a country that has not done anything to them in their first, there

312
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:26,100
is historical precedent in terms of Germany in the 30s and who did that before, what

313
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:35,900
we British did in India in the 1800s, the same exact same thing, so Israel is not

314
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:42,060
in very good company, but if they want to be in that company that's there right, that's

315
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:48,620
all for now, I will drop a few more comments later, thank you for playing this, again Hassan

316
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:53,780
from Zen Francisco, currently London, goodbye, it's a good day for the one.

317
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,580
All right Hassan, thank you, interesting accents there, it sounds like you're half Indian

318
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,900
half Australian, not quite sure where you're from, do you know at this point where all

319
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,780
the places you've been traveling, but pretty interesting, you open up the topic there

320
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,100
of the war and the Middle East, let's not call it a crisis, let's just call it what it

321
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:16,820
is, it's a war, now of course in the States everyone's talking about World War 3, I don't

322
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:22,580
know if we'll ever really see a World War the way we've seen the previous two, but

323
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:26,780
I do believe that this has been long time coming and this is really what it's been all

324
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:35,500
about, there's a basic issue in the Middle East that has been raving since 65, and

325
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:42,100
I know, 56 shit, my history so crap this early in the morning, it's all about the division

326
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:48,380
that took place when usually before most of you were born, and I think that this has just

327
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,100
been a long, long time coming and I do not think it's going to stop, I think that this

328
00:17:52,100 --> 00:18:00,980
is what a lot of the U.S. invasion of Iraq is about, all the talk about Iran, about Syria,

329
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:06,100
about Libya, all these things are now coming to head, and it's not going to stop, clearly

330
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:12,260
I heard President Bush say, the irony of the whole situation is all it takes is for us

331
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:17,140
side from Syria to make one call to has a lot to say, stop doing that shit, and it would

332
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:22,780
apparently stop, so that call, I guess still has not been made, and I don't think it's

333
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:28,100
going to be made, and I think that we're in a long haul, it's not going to be one huge

334
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:33,020
nuclear explosion, I really don't believe that, but this is not going to stop, it's

335
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:38,660
only going to spread, and I think it's going to get far worse before it gets better,

336
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:44,740
and we just have to start dealing with it, and I think that it's, once we get past all

337
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,860
the pretty explosion pictures that, what's at Anderson Cooper has been bringing to me

338
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,700
all weekend long, I think we can really drill down to what's going on here, and someone's

339
00:18:53,700 --> 00:19:01,140
got to say it, and it seems like the U.S. presses is really not getting into the actual

340
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,940
issues, you know, this is history folks, this has been going on for a long time, and just

341
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:11,300
please look at what's going on, and you'll see that it doesn't seem like there's a resolution

342
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:18,660
between these warring tribes, I'm very concerned, I love to hear European and about it,

343
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,860
we've got the voicemail numbers, not a lot of calls over the weekend, so give me a call,

344
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,220
in New Jersey is where you can call, you know, dial one number, that's probably best for

345
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:35,540
Skype out, so that's plus one for the USA, 201, 625, 6357, if you wish you can call the

346
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:45,300
number that I've set up in London, it's plus 44076813753. Shadow Falls getting a lot of hits,

347
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:50,500
people listening to the show, digging it, getting hooked, loving it, I promised you all kinds of

348
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:59,060
backstory and stuff, and now I'm not quite sure if this is from the producers, or if this is

349
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:07,060
from a fan, but there was a new, a new podshow plus page was created, the diary of Molly Hammaker,

350
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:12,100
now Molly, if you've heard Shadow Falls at Shadow Falls dot podshow dot com, it's she's really

351
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:20,340
narrating the story of what's happening in Shadow Falls, and she now has put up her diary online,

352
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,900
it's, you can get pretty deep into this stuff if you want to, hold on, it's like I've got,

353
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,460
I've got to adjust the height of the baker's rack, it's not exactly where I want it to be.

354
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,300
So yeah, that's Molly Hammaker dot podshow dot com, I'll put a link in the show notes as well,

355
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,300
I'm sorry about Friday's show notes, something went wrong, and none of the pod save songs that I

356
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:44,820
played got listed in the show notes, I'm totally messed up. Had it, oh, on Friday, by the way,

357
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,620
we signed up with someone very exciting to the podshow podcast network Kevin Eps, if you don't

358
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:57,380
know who Kevin Eps is, he's San Francisco native, actually let me see if I can, if I can find this

359
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:05,220
page, I'm definitely going to link to this in the show notes. He did this movie,

360
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,580
let me see what's the name of the movie he did, straight out of Hunter's point, which was really

361
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:16,500
a hip hop movie, and he's involved in the whole high-fee movement, you know, a high-fee HYPHY,

362
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,540
yeah, I had to ask HYPHY was spelled too, but he's going to be following the high-fee movement,

363
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:29,540
which is specific to San Francisco, I think even the Bay Area, it's a very glam type of hip hop

364
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,500
that's come out of San Francisco, and all of the, you know, the true leaders of this movement are

365
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:42,580
here, and it's not just music, it's style, it's attitude, it's quite amazing, it's taking the

366
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:48,340
world by storm, and really happy to have Kevin Eps as a member of the network, and so he doesn't

367
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,420
have a podcast yet, he's going to be creating one from scratch, it's going to be a video podcast,

368
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:57,380
but he'll be bringing a lot of high-fee artists into the pod save music, network is very,

369
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:03,380
very excited about that. And let me see what we have, a couple minutes left.

370
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,380
Maybe I should play, there's a story I've been wanting, a couple of stories I've been wanting

371
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:15,060
to tell you for a long, long time, and finally I have a reason to talk about it after this,

372
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:22,100
this message that was sent in about Deflapard. Good morning Adam, this is Rocker Kevin from the

373
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:29,460
Rocker Kevin Show. I'm contacting you for three reasons, actually. One of them is to thank you so much

374
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:38,420
for introducing me to pod casting. You encouraged me to do my own pod cast, the Rocker Kevin Show,

375
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:46,020
I am now on episode three, and already have listeners all over the world. It's quite exciting.

376
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:52,580
I also wanted to thank you for introducing me and thousands of other people to the pod safe

377
00:22:52,580 --> 00:23:00,180
music network. On episode three, I played a track from Danko Jones, which I first heard on your show

378
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:05,540
while back, and I am really impressed. You just don't hear groups like that on radio.

379
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:12,900
And without the pod safe music network, we'd probably never hear groups like that, so I just want to thank you for that.

380
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,820
I'm also hoping you can help out with the Deflapard Challenge. What is the Deflapard Challenge?

381
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:25,780
Well, here's the sound file that I'm sending to Deflapard and their management, and it'll explain it pretty well.

382
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:32,100
The Deflapard Challenge. Good Wednesday morning, July 26th.

383
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:39,460
By this time, you've already got Rocker Kevin Show number three, and already know about the Deflapard Challenge.

384
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:45,380
Here is the snippet from Rocker Kevin Show number three that describes the Deflapard Challenge.

385
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:52,980
I've seen Deflapard eight times since the hysteria tour, and it still sorrows me to this day

386
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,820
that they don't play anything off on through the night. I'd give anything to see them perform

387
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:06,660
wasted, or it don't matter, or answer to the master, but they never do. They haven't performed

388
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:12,100
those songs in so long, I bet they don't even know how to play them anymore. You know, I saw the

389
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:19,780
who won time, and they played the entire Quadrofini out. I challenged Deflapard to do something similar.

390
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:25,700
I challenged them to play on through the night in its entirety, or me. So, and he keeps on going

391
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:30,020
about all the songs that they haven't played, and I want to tell you the story about Deflapard

392
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:35,540
from the late 80s, early 90s. Unfortunately, if you're listening to us on serious stars 102,

393
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:40,020
you'll have to go to dailysourcecode.com to download the rest of the show. Go to podshow.com to

394
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:44,260
hear a whole bunch of other cool podcasts, and of course I'll see you tomorrow. PCH next for you guys

395
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:49,620
right here on serious stars 102. So, we just finished up this quick, quick, a comment by Kevin,

396
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:53,460
just to hear all the other songs, Deflapard's not playing on the current tool. Even high and dry.

397
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:59,540
In fact, Dammit, you're here and at first on the Rocker Kevin show right here. I'm throwing

398
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,900
down the gauntlet. I'm going to send this podcast to their management and to the group,

399
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:11,300
and I want them to take the challenge. Come on guys, there are enough hardcore fans out there

400
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:16,100
that will support this tour and make it well worth your while. Now, man up, do it.

401
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,700
Well, that about sums it up. You know, Adam, if you could play this on the daily source code,

402
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,580
I would greatly appreciate it. And I just want to say again, thank you for everything you do

403
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:33,540
and wins from my tail. Oh, thank you. No problem, Rocker Kevin. Okay. So, in the late 80s, I

404
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:38,260
actually became quite befriended with the guys from Deflap. But the reason being,

405
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,660
I was doing radio and television in Holland, and they recorded their album there

406
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:51,380
in the vis-a-lored studios. In fact, was it, is Rick the drummer? I've even forget now.

407
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:59,380
He had his car accident, wasn't that same period where he lost his arm. And so around 87,

408
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:05,060
when I went to the States to go work for MTV, Deflapard was just exploding all over the place.

409
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,980
And they had, you know, huge tour. They remember they had the in the round tour. And this is actually

410
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,940
a story Brittany Mason has been bugging me to tell because she's also a huge Deflapard fan.

411
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:21,060
There's a lot of us out there. They had the in the round tour. And at the time, MTV sent me off

412
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:28,340
to go and follow the tour. And I think this was in Atlanta. And I'd interviewed the guys a couple

413
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,900
times before that. And there was this whole mysterious rock of ages club. And, you know,

414
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,420
there was a lot of talk about it. No one quite knew what the rock of ages club was,

415
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:43,460
rock of ages, of course, one of their songs. And in Atlanta, they were performing in the round,

416
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,540
which is kind of cool because the way the guys got to the stage, you know, I mean,

417
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:51,460
you don't just walk out through the middle of the crowd, right? And then onto the stage,

418
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:57,860
you want them to appear magically from the middle of the auditorium. And so how do you get them

419
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:05,300
there? Well, they had these huge linen boxes where, you know, they would probably, you'd see these

420
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:09,220
being canvas, I guess they are, that you see this being wheeled around a venue and maybe it would

421
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:15,380
contain, well, you don't know what's in there, right? Maybe it's linen or laundry or who knows.

422
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,300
But of course, that contained the band members. And so while the lights were all still on and people

423
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,540
are getting, you know, getting their seats a couple of these things, which is wheeled by inconspicuously.

424
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:27,300
But actually it was bringing the band underneath the stage to prepare for the gig.

425
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,340
Now, during the song, just before the song rock of ages, which apparently is when the rock of

426
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:39,460
ages club kicks in, a couple of their security guys brought me from, from where I was sitting right

427
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,220
up front and they brought me underneath the stage. And of course, underneath the stage of this whole

428
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:48,660
world that goes on when you're performing in the round. And the rock of ages is basically,

429
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:55,300
it's, you know, they do the whole song, but there's about a seven-minute drum solo that's

430
00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:00,020
right in the middle. And of course, you know, Rick, the one arm drummer would do the drum solo.

431
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,180
But then the rest of the band would go off stage and they'd go down below. And here's what was

432
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:10,740
taking place. Is the roadies and the security guys would get all the, obviously, willing girls

433
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:15,380
from the audience, bring them underneath the stage. And the guys, and that included me in this

434
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,900
particular instance, would all take pictures with their boobs hanging out. And I was like,

435
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:26,100
this is what the rock of ages club is. Oh, I feel so proud to be a member somewhere. I have a

436
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,940
couple of Polaroids. I wish I could find him because I definitely scanned them for you and

437
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:36,180
put them up online. Okay, that's enough of the booby stories from Monday morning.

438
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:43,780
A couple of guys from Sweden, New Leaf and the Magic Carpet on your daily source code.

439
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:56,180
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

440
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:49,460
Oh, and now, cause I take you over this down tonight, on my magic cup, but don't hold on tight, I'll take you away from the rising light,

441
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:57,460
This is you never, ever been before

442
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:26,460
As we passed a newborn star, she said, she'll never do so, all struck by her feet

443
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:42,540
Nice, she's alive and I was dead, you never, ever, ever, ever, love for us, Ooooh, move our baby with her

444
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,340
And being like that, she's really expectable, and she got so happy that she also did it.

445
00:30:49,340 --> 00:31:03,340
And let your bare feet stay warm and I'll take you over the sound tonight

446
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:11,340
For my magic of the warm tight

447
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:17,340
I'll take you away from the cry tonight

448
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:24,340
But this is you never ever ever before

449
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,340
All that it might be

450
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:55,340
And let your bare feet stay warm and I'll take you away from the cry tonight
