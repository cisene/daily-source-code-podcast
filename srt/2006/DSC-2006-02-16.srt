1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Delta's Yeracharli 337, the Apple tastes good.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
$16 billion worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I like to think I'm flying into this genre.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
On casting, it's Adam Curry.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
One day while I was working hard at doing nothing,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I was sitting around for hours.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And I thought how cool it would be if I had some

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Can't get superpowers.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There'd be so many to choose from.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So I'm helpful, so I'm just fine.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And tell that I think I just need.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I like the ability to make a large enough pancake

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
for all the starving children to eat.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Or I could have a hypnotic finger that could shoot a rib

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
that'd be great.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I could blast all people to whereas right in the crotch

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and take away their ability to form a cake.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
On the back straight vision and I could make the decision

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
if I want to see you naked or not.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The ability to change the law

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
make things like once and for all

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and finally leave a wise pie.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I want superpowers.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I want superpowers.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I want superpowers.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Superpowers.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I would like to be able to freeze time

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and stop everything in its path.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And I could take someone from falling off a cliff

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
or I could choose to have someone with me.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'd take time and bend it

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and I'd learn how to spend it

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
especially with the Antonio.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'd become an inventor

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and I'd make things way better

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
like an actual good tasting beer.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I want superpowers.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I want superpowers.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I want superpowers.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Superpowers.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I want superpowers.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I want superpowers.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I want superpowers.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Superpowers.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Like being able to breathe under water

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
or stop bullets with my face.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And being bent to the pool

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
to your voice and his drinks

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and leave a paper trail without a trace.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But being able to lift a stream

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
we might object with only the use of my hands.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Or have fire and breath of a thousand

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
racking to it.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I can have a year out of ten.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And being able to cure all the seeds

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
in the world and being bent

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
cows not so bad.

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And being put in the walls

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm not fully material

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
so the scientists are like going far.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What change everything

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
to the metrics system

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
so they're grateful to the waste.

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And I give myself the capability

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and the way of building such a taste.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I want superpowers.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I want superpowers.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I want superpowers.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Superpowers.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I want superpowers.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I want superpowers.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I want superpowers.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Superpowers.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I want superpowers.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I want superpowers.

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I want superpowers.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I want superpowers.

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I want superpowers.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I want superpowers.

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,500
Super power

82
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,080
I want Super Power

83
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,380
Yes you told me I want Super Power

84
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,080
Yes you tell me I want Super Power

85
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,000
оп I want Super Power

86
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,640
We Super Power

87
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,120
I want Super Power

88
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,720
Yes you told me Robert

89
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:53,440
It's not quite a hot shape yet, but it's coming, Mark says hi, and I want super high.

90
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,440
Oh, it's...

91
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,440
Thank you.

92
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,440
You're really super.

93
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,440
So this is a guy who I met yesterday at Sirius Adly Radio when I was in New York.

94
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
Well, I'm still in New York, actually.

95
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Early Thursday morning on my way home tonight.

96
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,440
I don't know why, for some reason I booked a flight at like 9.25 this evening.

97
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,440
So I've got, you know, I've got to figure out stuff to do today.

98
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,440
Yesterday, last night, last evening.

99
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,440
I was up at Sirius, and I was planning on doing some recording.

100
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:36,440
And for a number of reasons that didn't work out, but I was assigned a board-up as we call it, a board operator.

101
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,440
Because it was going to be done in a real studio, quite a treat for me.

102
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,440
And guys name Mark, Mark Seaman.

103
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,440
Yeah, I know.

104
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,440
But we don't laugh about names here on the Charlie now, do we?

105
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,440
And when we were talking, he's just learning a little bit about podcasting.

106
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,440
He started there as an intern, and he's a musician.

107
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,440
And so Ron and I were talking to him.

108
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,440
And he says, well, yeah, he's my CD.

109
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,440
It's called the EP of the Century, Mark says high.

110
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
Of course.

111
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,440
So you probably figured out the title that song was Super Powers.

112
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,440
And, you know, I told him about the podcast of music network.

113
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,440
And I guess he's going to go check it out.

114
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,440
But listen to the CD before starting the show.

115
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
I kind of let Doug this song.

116
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,440
So I thought I'd share that with you, even though it was damn long.

117
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Like five minutes and 46 seconds.

118
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,440
Yes.

119
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Our trips in New York is just about over.

120
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,440
As I said today, I'll just be visiting a couple more people on my way out of town.

121
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,440
I'm so incredibly tired.

122
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
You have no idea.

123
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,440
You may not give a damn, and you probably don't want to hear that in the morning,

124
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
because you may be tired too.

125
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,440
But man, I'm just so incredibly beat.

126
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
It's been six hours of night.

127
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
You know, I've been doing the show.

128
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,440
And PW has been putting it together.

129
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
And editing it all in the evening.

130
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,440
And it's just been quite a lot along with all the discussions we've had with

131
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,440
marketing companies, agencies, and many of them old friends.

132
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,440
So good to see them in this new context.

133
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,440
It's just good.

134
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,440
This is, you know, once a quarter, that's what we do.

135
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,440
We're going to write on down in town and go see if we can sell some

136
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,440
quarterback.

137
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,440
So here's an interesting story I heard in the, in the hallways, it's serious,

138
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,440
some water cooler talk.

139
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,440
There was a big meeting recently.

140
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,440
And it's funny because I know what happened, or I knew what was,

141
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,440
I knew something was happening because we got a request.

142
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,440
PW Fenton, and usually when the request goes straight to PW,

143
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,440
who produces all the serious satellite radio shows.

144
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,440
Usually when they go to him directly, it's an end around.

145
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,440
You know, they don't want me to know something about what they're asking.

146
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,440
And so they had asked for a piece of, and they gave out some time code or

147
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,440
something.

148
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,440
Anyway, PW Fenton, I did deduce that it was, it was clearly

149
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
Madge Weinstein.

150
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,440
And so he, of course, emailed me and said, you know,

151
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,440
something's up, you know, they want to have this piece.

152
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,440
And I, you know, say that to them and tell them if there's anything

153
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
we can help them with, give me a call.

154
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
So it didn't hear anything about it.

155
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
And that was two or three weeks ago.

156
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,440
And actually, they specifically wanted a piece of Madge,

157
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
one of her driving podcasts.

158
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,440
You know, she's always very funny when she's driving.

159
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,440
And during this big meeting just recently, a few days ago,

160
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,440
maybe last week, which was this big corporate, you know,

161
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
it's like what companies do.

162
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,440
But it was really the top echelon of the people who are programming

163
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
these 120 satellite radio channels.

164
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,440
And the CFO, the chief financial officer of serious,

165
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
David Freer, I think it is.

166
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,440
Yeah, as, I guess everyone does a little, you know,

167
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,440
their vision of the company, et cetera.

168
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,440
So the CFO, very interesting.

169
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,440
The first of all, great that this guy is listening to stuff.

170
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,440
That's so incredibly appreciated.

171
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,440
He got up and played this piece of Madge,

172
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,440
which, uh, PWPs can get me the clip.

173
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,440
I couldn't find it that quickly.

174
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
Before I just fall down from tiredness.

175
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,440
And he played this clip, and he just was raving about it.

176
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
This is exactly what we should be sounding like.

177
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
This is different. This is irreverent.

178
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
This is, you know, this is the future,

179
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
which, of course, is fantastic.

180
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
And like we didn't know that.

181
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Like we don't know that it's not the children,

182
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
but Madge who's really our future.

183
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
But the funny thing was,

184
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,440
that throughout this entire, um,

185
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,440
a praising monologue of Madge Weinstein and East radio,

186
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,440
he was referring to her as this Jewish woman from Chicago.

187
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,440
And, um, I think most people,

188
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,440
know Madge long enough to know exactly what she is and what she stands for.

189
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,440
And it was just a hilarious, uh, hilarious moment.

190
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,440
And I don't know if Mr. Frier knows yet,

191
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,440
but we're happy that you love Madge.

192
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,440
And we all, we all love Madge and what she does.

193
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,440
So I've got a couple things, uh,

194
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,440
lined up for you.

195
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,440
There's actually waiting for the pod safe music network to come back online,

196
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,440
because, you know, we're getting all that sales stuff and everything,

197
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
and they're moving servers.

198
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Let me just check for a second.

199
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
Hold on.

200
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Let me see if it's back up.

201
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,440
Damn, it's not.

202
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,440
And all of a sudden I realize what an incredibly important resource this is,

203
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
because I'm getting ready to prep my show.

204
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,440
Usually, you know, I go through and check what's new on the homepage,

205
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
and look at new submissions.

206
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,440
And maybe I'll go back through my playlist and pull something that I've played it,

207
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
you know, a few episodes ago.

208
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
And, uh, it's, you know,

209
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
I'm sorry, we'll be back removing servers and like,

210
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,440
oh, man, that sucks.

211
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,440
Ah, that and the fact that I don't have any sense of sale is,

212
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,440
uh, yeah, without a doubt, that it's bad.

213
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
It's really bad.

214
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,440
If anything going home means seeing my girls,

215
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,440
it also means seeing that lovely sense of sale machine.

216
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Well, I have some news report first of all about Trinity.

217
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,440
There is a, uh, a fund, uh, meaning a fund of, uh,

218
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,440
investment money that is called Indo-Street.

219
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Well, I have some news report first of all about Trinity.

220
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,440
There is a, uh, a fund, uh, meaning a fund of, uh,

221
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
investment money, that is, uh,

222
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,960
a fund of investment money that is investing specifically in green technologies amongst

223
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:34,240
which will be biodiesel and to the folks have been listening to the show and they're very

224
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:41,360
interested in sponsoring our little talk about biodiesel and Trinity and of course

225
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:48,320
we want to do something kind of unique. So the sponsorship will go primarily towards pimping out

226
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,360
Trinity and of course we're going to turn that into a video podcast. I imagine paint my ride this

227
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:00,080
will be paint my biodiesel beast or something better than I'll come up with and I'm so excited

228
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,000
about this. You know I've got to figure out some slogan to put on the side what colors are going to

229
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,280
be. We're going to chop the roof. We're going to make it into part convertible but I mean that is

230
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,760
you know that's that's your money and put to good use. I'm telling you I cannot wait

231
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,320
Patricia was excited. She's like wow we'll have like the servo so it could pop up and down like

232
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,640
a hip hop mobile. I say yeah baby you better believe it and we have some little spin and rims so

233
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,680
just wanted to share that with you and as I said we'll we'll be podcasting that. Probably a video podcast.

234
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:37,040
Okay a couple of emails that have come in regarding at the biodiesel industry and Trinity. Let's see

235
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,680
Halifax and this comes to us from Steve Din. After two years of running biodiesel in a fleet of

236
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:51,600
buses check this out something is starting to smell fishy in the city of Halifax. The city quit using

237
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,160
a unique B20 which is the same stuff Willie Nelson is selling 20% biodiesel 80% petrodiesel.

238
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,600
So they quit using this unique blend of fish oil based biodiesel in its fleet of municipal

239
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,440
buses this past December after encountering some operational difficulties. What could those be you think?

240
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:20,000
Well indeed it was smelling in addition according to the uh to the herald the municipality

241
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,360
took up the issue with the supplier Wilson fuel cocks which denied a problem with a fuel existed.

242
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,880
Really was they say that they had problems with the lines clogging up so they've halted the use of it.

243
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,800
I don't know that this is fish oil though. I think that's that may be something all together

244
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,080
different than now just the yeah the normal french fries stuff that we're looking at.

245
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,520
Article in uh wasn't fortune magazine online. I'll make sure I put that put that link in the show notes.

246
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:56,160
The article mentions 80% of all new vehicles are able to use bio fuels. Of course in that case

247
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,560
we're talking about mostly ethanol mixtures for petrol engines which will have the yellow fuel cap by the way.

248
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,120
And of course it also mentions good old Willie Nelson's bio wheelie. Dude we got to talk to him.

249
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,200
He'd be perfect for a segment on uh on Trinity. Christian Euben uh in in behind excuse me

250
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,800
Adam up to now Germany was known as a biodiesel paradise.

251
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,960
Biodiesel costs about a euro per liter which is pretty cheap compared with regular gas. Yeah that's about half the price.

252
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,880
They're nearly 2,000 gas stations providing drivers with green diesel in a growing market. But yesterday

253
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,920
I was really shocked when I heard that the German minister of finance is planning a biodiesel tax.

254
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,040
The government's going to collect 10 euro since per liter of biodiesel and an even 15% on vegetable oil.

255
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:53,200
As result of this announcement, German biodiesel stocks plunged harshly more than 10%

256
00:15:53,200 --> 00:16:00,320
I guess more than 10% that is pretty bad. Okay well it's bound to happen. I don't really mind

257
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,000
and I'm not quite sure how it works in Germany but in uh in many countries you know your roads

258
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,840
or you know the the tax in the fuel actually goes or should be going towards making the roads better

259
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,480
and maintenance and upkeep so and it's so it's what it's like 15% yeah that's not too bad.

260
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,920
You look at a country like the Netherlands where the tax is almost 50% on the fuel. In fact

261
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,120
famously one minister said excuse me I have a super coffee here.

262
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:35,680
One minister famously said that he was going to add 25 cents onto the uh onto the price of a

263
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,280
liter of fuel but we'd be getting it back in two years time or some time period similar to that

264
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:47,120
he never gave it back. They still joke about that in the Netherlands. Staying in Europe

265
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,760
Paul Frone says hey Adam would really enjoy the podcast this is to regularly read this article.

266
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:57,200
Oh yeah this is about Brussels. Brussels where the uh European Union where the European

267
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:03,840
Commission has its part-time seat is really starting to push biodiesel. This is all good news.

268
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,480
Colin Sloman adamant in the listener for over a year and joyed I've worked in the energy industry

269
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,480
for more than 20 years and find your biodiesel Trinity segment fascinating.

270
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,840
But you might be interested in the following article and of course he points to the

271
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:23,600
fortune article as well but then as a little piece down below a British petroleum to fund

272
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,240
Indian project to produce biodiesel in New Delhi where this petroleum is an ounce of

273
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:36,720
a fund a 9.4 million dollar project in the energy and resource institute in Andra Pradesh to produce

274
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,520
biodiesel from geotrophic curcus which is a non-edible oil bearing crop.

275
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,880
This is great. Diesel engines rule man you can really just throw anything into them that you want.

276
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,960
Oh hold on we got an audio feedback check this out.

277
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,320
Hey Adam this is Ben G.C. over in Whitton Hills California. I got my road in track today

278
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,520
on March if you want page 102 it turns out that while you can't really poop in a

279
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,240
diesel tank yet you sure can't pee in it and this article called the diesel conundrum

280
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,640
there's a section here called piss on it and I quote urea an ammonia-based compound

281
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,320
one source of which is mammal urine is becoming controversial in diesel emissions control

282
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:29,600
also known as SCR selective catalytic reduction urea injection into the exhaust for most

283
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:35,840
chemical reduction of N.O.X. European automakers are interested in SCR as a means of meeting

284
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,480
there and our increasingly stringent N.O.X regulations. So it looks like maybe you'll be able to

285
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,320
pin you in the Trinity's tanks and even help the environment while you're doing it. But you like to know

286
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,640
and here's my plug my son's got a great podcast for teenage gamers it's called game snafu

287
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:02,080
available on iTunes and at his website two cool dudes dot com k-o-o cool dudes dot com

288
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,440
and me every now and then they let me play various body parts of dust and often on

289
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,200
Pacific Coast highway okay I'm not quite sure what that means but it sounds pretty frightening

290
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:20,240
alright excellent so there is so much more to learn about biofuel bio diesel as we continue our

291
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,320
quest to saving the planet that's right save the world and win great prizes

292
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:57,040
and how to's if you have watched the video of podcasts or conference 2006 in Chapel Hill from the

293
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:03,440
Mac Pro podcast you can see me there in the interview yes during that time I was a learner

294
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,760
I'm willing to learn how to do podcasts and now an official member of Fortune Network family and

295
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:16,640
in a podcast soon we will be talking about tips tricks and how to's about traditional Indian

296
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:23,040
cookery talking about tips I would like to share some facts about curry in Indian food curry

297
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:32,320
as I was derived from a Tamil word spelled as k-a-r-i and tamal is one of the salt Indian language

298
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:40,000
one of the 26 languages spoken in India and of course tamal is my mother tongue and I'm from

299
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,360
Tamil Nadu so curry means sauce it refers to various kind of dishes which include vegetables,

300
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:55,600
meats, potato, etc usually pad with right and there is another one called masala or curry masala so

301
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:03,680
masala has as we've made the spices it's a thick pastey sauce it's a combination of spices butter

302
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,320
coconut milk and different kinds of spices and there is a leaf called curry leaves which

303
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,720
it is used in the Indian cookery in South Indian cookery it is a whole ship it's about an inch

304
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:23,840
in land it's almost looks like a leaf from a citrus tree it is fried and cooked with the dish

305
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:32,160
that's all I have to say about in a tip about curry in this small comment and once again thank you

306
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,840
for listening to our show and thank you for having me in your show thank you very much Adam

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:52,800
you're doing for us thank you and you all have a great day bye go what's that

309
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,680
okay had a little tail there on the MP3 sorry about the the the left channel right channel thing

310
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
let me just cast blushers pretty cool you could you could just mono the signal but I couldn't find

311
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,240
it that quick you can do it on the fly snow or back to stereo I don't like curry not to be honest

312
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,480
with you whenever I go out if someone takes me out to an Indian restaurant they have to order

313
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,920
for me not to specify no please you know whatever it gets something I'll eat it but no what is it

314
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:31,360
coriander is that what oh man I just just don't like that at all let me see still to come I

315
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,400
think we can do a metro sexual moment got another potting music song one that I pulled in from

316
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:43,920
the archives and we'll keep it relatively short since I'm tired I already told you that

317
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,960
and then tomorrow morning when I get back to London I get in what I get a nine o'clock or something

318
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,480
like that so I'll probably get in sleep for an hour or two and then I'll do the show maybe a

319
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,240
little bit later a little bit later than usual and I hope that's something to talk about hope

320
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,240
something goes on today something I mean what am I going to do for all these hours in New York

321
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:13,920
if you're checking this out on star serious 103 before warned very soon I think within a

322
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:21,120
week or two we'll be moving to channel 102 they're adding another another channel to the

323
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:27,120
serious lineup which is what is it called the blue collar comedy channel yeah the blue collar comedy

324
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:35,120
channel so that will take over channel 103 and we're moving up so you'll have Howard Stern

325
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:42,640
a channel 100 then you have his second channel which during the day I believe repeats the show

326
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,400
and then they have Howard news or whatever that's our 101 and then conveniently located right next to

327
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,680

329
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:10,960
a Madge Weinstein with East Ries Ries Ries Ries Ries Ries Ries Radyope and then Dawn and Drew

330
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,760
and I don't have a clue at all is it good more daily is that on tonight and then I don't know

331
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:23,040
if it is DVD weekly day or not and we're going to start fitting more more podcasts more new podcasts

332
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:29,200
into the pod show lineup so stay tuned for that and I will talk to all of you on the satellite tomorrow

333
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:37,840
for the Friday edition and meanwhile here on the show quick note about advertising since we are

334
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,080
on our Madison Avenue trip Kevin Mason says Adam I'm the owner of an Amazon parrot

335
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,720
well to keep the bird from getting bored we play the radio yes radio is for the birds

336
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,840
the issue comes when I walk into the room the radio station always seems to be playing their

337
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,080
promo toop in their own horn about how they only play two minutes of commercials every hour

338
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,440
if that's so why am I always hearing the same promo my parrot is less repetitive

339
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,800
we're thinking about finding some way to play podcasts for the bird perhaps some big mic

340
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,520
because she apparently likes big mic my point is that regardless of the earthling spots podcasting

341
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,480
is still nicer to listen to let's do the math radio station two minutes of ads per hour plus

342
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,240
bragging about the fact they only have two minutes of an hour of ads is eight minutes

343
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,640
delta share charlie thirty seconds of ads per hour plus burps is one minute one minute per hour

344
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,040
so in other words after download eight delta share charlie to hit the same amount of ads

345
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:37,680
that I do in one hour radio well as we you know as I've kind of discovered yesterday the most

346
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,520
important thing is the repetitiveness of it that that's really it's starting to bug me too

347
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,840
I don't mind the earthling commercial although you know the the call is going out and

348
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:54,400
and we have a brainstorming session with earthling next week about this you know this whole idea

349
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,640
of how do we get user generated advertising into podcast so be prepared is your call to action

350
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,040
but the repetitive nature of it that does I must say that does kill me as I said yesterday

351
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,320
it would be like playing the same promo over and over on the show or the same song over and over

352
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,520
because you know we don't just happen to tune in sometime during those you know that that

353
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,440
eight minutes an hour in fact we're actually zapping away during that eight minutes an hour

354
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,720
whatever you do don't don't don't don't don't zap away right now please just stay right there you

355
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:32,160
believe anything is possible stop fast forwarding don't do that plank we believe in an

356
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,440
internet that's safe from virus hidden scammers we're earthling we believe your personal

357
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,720
information should be just that personal and we believe your internet should be a friend

358
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:49,280
not a faux we're earthling make this smart choice visit earthlink.net and discover what our

359
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:57,920
internet experts can do for you earthlink we revolve around you right to yesterday at the

360
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:05,280
end of the show I played a promo from the Frank Whitt podcast and at the end of the promo there was

361
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,600
there was a line that was it's his funniest cancer I think was the name it's so it's a promo

362
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:19,360
about the show and the tagline was funniest cancer and I just end this whole thing about about

363
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,600
someone in the pod show family who had been very close to a cancer death and it of course was

364
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,600
completely the wrong thing to play now I did preface at the beginning of the show that anything

365
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:40,000
could happen because I was just pulling stuff randomly out of my Gmail account and so when I heard this

366
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,520
it just it totally freaked me out and I was you know mostly pissed at myself for not having

367
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,160
checked out what I was going to play so yeah sometimes it worked sometimes it doesn't this was

368
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:58,000
definitely not a good example of how surprise works well in in in this particular podcast

369
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,160
of course we've done that before and it's turned out differently and my reaction was really

370
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:11,520
came from the gut and but it wasn't really meant as a personal attack on on the Frank Whitt podcast

371
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:19,360
and there's all kinds of conversation going on at curry dot com all kinds of comments and of

372
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:26,800
course now it's all my fault but I don't I really don't see it that way it what it what it taught

373
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,840
me first of all is I can't do that you know that's just way too risky but I just want you to know

374
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:38,320
that well actually Frank Whitt responded to this so I'll just play it's kind of long so

375
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:45,360
play a piece of what he said okay so this fucking sucks this isn't like a real show or anything

376
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:54,880
I just had to put this out because I feel a fallout coming basically we did a promo or Julia

377
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:03,200
did a promo for us and I retweaked it a little bit and added an old quote of Robbie at the end saying

378
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:11,200
it's fun like cancer and I'd shot that promo off to a bunch of people including Adam Curry

379
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:20,480
who I no longer listen to I don't listen to any of the pod show podcast now this is so funny

380
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,960
I don't listen I don't listen get damn it but I sent him a promo and then I just kind of check

381
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:32,720
to see if he played it I mainly stick with the media podcast as I've told you guys before and

382
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:45,760
so I checked out his show tonight for him getting ready to go to bed and basically

383
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:54,720
to see if he'd played he was going to play the promo and as I listened I started to grow

384
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:03,680
and increasingly nervous because he was talking about so their podcast or match Weinstein who I'd

385
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:10,480
I'd also listen to a long time ago it had an in a long time was not her show either and

386
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:20,320
basically her partner had passed away I guess of cancer lymphoma I went and researched this

387
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:28,240
afterwards because I started to feel so shitty because he played our promo and that cancer bit

388
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:35,760
comes on at the end and you know he just kind of gets upset and processes you know bad stupid promo

389
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:42,320
on his show notes and it's really fucking lame that I mean that's a bad coincidence like I said

390
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,320
on the blog post I'm a hypo contract I have to make fun of these things I've watched several

391
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:57,200
people in my life dive horrible cancer I mean horrible bad and it's awful but you know you got

392
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:04,000
a laugh at the shit because it's going to get one for of us I mean there's no escaping it it's it's

393
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:10,240
I mean they don't you know there's no cure for it it's so he basically goes on you know to say

394
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,320
that this is about laughing about horrible things and I'm all for that humor is a great great

395
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,880
of what humor is a great way to to deal with grief and with pain etc but this is just more

396
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,480
a lesson about well we've already gone through my lesson I learned that I you know I should not

397
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,760
be doing stuff and just playing without having previewed it but also it's about context if you

398
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:38,880
know your own show and you and you create a promo I'm not you heard your show I mean I stop listening

399
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:46,400
to your show I only stood if see if you play bits when I talk about you when you know your

400
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,800
own show it's and you put a promo together you really have to think for a couple seconds is this

401
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:57,840
within the context of what this promo is will will people understand all the all the little bits

402
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:03,520
and quotes in the context within the which they're said and listen to your promo again I don't

403
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:08,960
think so and of course at the end you know if a part of your show is to make fun of if you are

404
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,720
you know I didn't know you were hyper-contract I couldn't tell that from the promo I didn't know that

405
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,880
you know that this is your way perhaps of dealing with with the with the pains of of living

406
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,280
with someone or yourself with with a horrible disease you know so there's no way for me there

407
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:31,200
was no context for me to know that so of course it it all worked out horribly in the show

408
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,440
but if you're making a promo you really need to pay attention to that because if I had previewed

409
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,680
the promo I wouldn't have played it and regardless of what I was going to talk about on the show

410
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:47,760
I wouldn't have played it because you know at this time in my life I just don't find that funny

411
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:54,480
not in that context now if the if your show deals with stuff like that and you make a joke out of

412
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:02,480
out of things like cancer you know as as and as and lots of fantastic comedy where pain can

413
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,440
be replaced by laughter of course I'm all for it but I would say the promo definitely wouldn't have

414
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:14,320
gotten played anyway just because at this point in my life it the way it was presented didn't come

415
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:19,440
across is very funny to me and that's also taught me a couple other things because I definitely

416
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:27,680
make jokes about all kinds of stuff that upsets me or I'm or pains me and I very often don't think

417
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:35,760
about other people who are you know within earshot what their personal feelings may be so I'm just

418
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:44,400
taking this as a personal lesson no personal offense meant or harm intended of course and let's all

419
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:54,880
just calm down just revisiting the cartoon controversy for a moment I got an email from Michael

420
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,640
and oh surprise I love it when this happens I love it when when when I get these kinds of emails

421
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:09,120
because Michael works at pod show and he starts up by saying that's probably the only

422
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:19,840
muslim at pod show damn one snuck in maybe the the real issue behind the cartoons is the

423
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:26,240
current war going on between NATO and the caliphist muslims I really don't think it has anything to

424
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,280
do with freedom of expression it's about the current war and is viewed by caliphist muslims

425
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,160
am I pronounced that right caliphist muslims in terms of a war not a liberal idea about freedom of

426
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:42,160
expression also in terms of immigration you will be surprised how much racism and xenophobia

427
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:47,520
immigrants from non-white countries are subjected to how can we expect people to integrate when

428
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,200
they are faced without right racism on a daily basis do you remember those no Irish need apply

429
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:59,440
signs from earlier in the American history but then again what do I know just an anarcho muslim

430
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:05,040
druid things I've learned by living amongst muslims here in abroad specifically the Netherlands

431
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:12,400
one of my religious teachers was a refugee in the Netherlands in Delft so Michael thank you very much

432
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:19,360
first of all um yep you know what actually I do know that a little bit funny enough when I was seven

433
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:26,400
years old and we moved from the time we lived in Kensington Maryland and we moved I was just about

434
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,960
to turn seven actually we were going to move to the Netherlands for three years this was a time when

435
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,920
a lot of US companies were just setting up shop in the Netherlands specifically places like Texas

436
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:42,320
Instruments in a couple of early high tech firms and there was quite an influx into this you know

437
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,960
relatively old world country and of course I went to the international school of Amsterdam

438
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,720
so didn't really integrate just like many other cultures you know there was no need to integrate

439
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,960
up picked up with the school bus taken to where all the American and you know other uh the

440
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:06,560
kids from other countries well but primarily Americans at the time um and boy was I discriminated against

441
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,640
and and in a foreign language which I didn't understand and the only thing I would understand

442
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:17,440
of these tirays that were thrown at me was you crazy American crazy American and when you're

443
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,480
seven years old you know that sucks and then they'd write shit with you know chalk on uh on the side

444
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,160
walk with a big arrow pointing towards our house now granted you know uh when someone writes fish poop

445
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,760
in a foreign language with an arrow to your house you know it ain't all that bad but at the time you

446
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,000
know I was that was pretty traumatizing I couldn't get a fucking break from anyone in the neighborhood

447
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,480
and there was a different culture and they had um pieces of PVC tubing that they'd roll up newspaper

448
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,480
newspapers into darts and then they'd shoot them at you as you were driving by or or riding by in your

449
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,440
bike and you know and of course had the wrong hair the wrong pants you know everything was wrong

450
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,600
so I do know what that feels like um because discrimination I think feels the same

451
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:09,280
regardless of what you're being discriminated about whether it's uh race, creed, color, sex,

452
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:18,240
sexual preference uh you know I think it's where you're from uh it it it feels the same and uh you

453
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:26,240
I think the bottom line is yeah it sucks but you know it's uh lots of people discriminated in fact

454
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:33,520
I think that uh everyone feels discriminated against at one point in their life and uh I'm sure

455
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,400
it doesn't help I'm really sure it doesn't help but you know all I can say is maybe this is the time

456
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:45,600
where I pull out the XNTV experiment again and suggest you go look at that you know look at television

457
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,240
and and tell me that there is in the world that's a picture that's being painted for you

458
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:57,600
that is just unrealistic and sometimes we get really upset when it doesn't turn out that way

459
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:03,920
we don't have the white picket fence you know just just doesn't exist man just does not exist

460
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:13,200
and now that I'm old I start feeling more and more like you know chill out and just ride the wheels

461
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,240
off this mother fucker we call life

462
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,960
well it's pretty interesting to see uh what rebel and rebellion there is against uh the

463
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:45,600
Metro sexual moment I'm hearing all kinds of podcasts or doing all kinds of you know manly man type

464
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:52,240
stuff and you know whatever come on you know and people actually know calling me queer and gay and

465
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:58,880
light-footed and I don't know I just think it's stuff that's interesting to talk about you know

466
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,240
I never get a chance to share any of these intimate grooming tips with any of my friends so I'm

467
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,520
happy for those of you who do to participate and and you know what this probably a whole bunch of

468
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,600

now on the business I want to share my husband's favorite Metro sexual shaving tip when he showers

472
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,360
he uses a product called sugar scrub you can get it just about anywhere it's a mixture of sugar and

473
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:42,960
essential oils he robs it on his face when he showers to exfoliate dead skin and the oil protects

474
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,480
his skin from the harshness of the blade he doesn't do it every day but when he does I love touching his face

475
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:55,520
and it smells good too thanks again Adam thank you Cali Cali from the geek brief geek brief.tv

476

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,680

478
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,920
quite a surprise and

479
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:18,480

480
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,680
Mike Travers says Adam just want to share my thoughts on the new five-bladed fusion

481
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:29,280
razor from Gillette it's brilliant I don't know if it's shaved so close because of the two extra blades

482
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,680
or if it's the vibrations but it blows the mock three away my only gripe is that the precision

483
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:39,120
blade on the back of the razor cartridge is very easily clogged and doesn't want to keen come clean

484
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:44,720
without a fight I've had less razor burn on my neck and less five o'clock shadow at the end of the

485
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,600
day as far as I'm concerned the precision razor can clog all I want that's all for knock you up

486
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:54,480
the good work my traverse forest science major at Penn State University well I gotta agree with you man

487
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,760
I've used this thing now for two days in a row it's nice it really is and of course you know

488
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,960
it has a little more you know robust feel to it they've done they've made a whole bunch of improvements

489
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,800
and I agree that the shave is it's quite close and and it does seem to stay closer for a little bit

490
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,640
longer and the precision yeah I don't really have a lot of nose hair to speak of anything else

491
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,920
you know my sideburns are kind of already groomed so

492
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:26,560
don't really have a lot of news for it but yeah there's a couple of things that I

493
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,520
removed with it hey so we move on from shaving one of these days and talk about something else

494
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:38,000
maybe we should talk about shaving parts of our body other than then your face

495
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:45,920
because believe me women notice that stuff too they really do and curries metro sectional moment

496
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,760
yeah okay well what are we at now we're 41 minutes okay I had two more things that I'm just

497
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:58,080
gonna just gonna do tomorrow as I said positive music network is down maybe time you hear this show

498
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:06,560
it's back up but plenty of reason to pull out bob gentries upside down now I've been talking in my

499
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:20,400
past sleep when I'm waking well my tongue is tight I've been thinking I should leave instead

500
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,800
of waiting for her when the time is right

501
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:35,200
I've backed the bags under my eyes well I've seen enough to know what it's like

502
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:47,280
it's turning me upside down tell me what I've done wrong now all I can do is try

503
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:57,680
when everything's breaking me down looking at the inside out well those rules got changed somehow

504
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:08,320
maybe it's suicide to stay here and just stick around I was able to hide every bruise on my body till now

505
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,760
until now

506
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:29,920
I've been walking in my last sleep when I'm waking up well my legs are tight

507
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:42,160
I've been thinking I should breathe put the window up it's a mare tonight

508
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:54,400
I've been dreaming I could fly it while I'm free enough but I'm still waiting
