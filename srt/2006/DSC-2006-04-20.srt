Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I heard you got your hands back.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm hearing about your flight back from Rotterdam and your lack of power.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Take off, I thought I'd come out and save this track just for you.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Learn to crawl.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Rock on it.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Love, you can feel fine.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You can dance with a little twist.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Tell your brilliant right hand.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Play me forget the lyrics.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Can you feel yourself in my better night?

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Would you leave me at the sorrow?

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
To walk right up to me.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Who's talking to me?

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm already asking.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Tell me.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Tell me.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm already playing.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Play me, please.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Can you teach me how to fly?

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
See, I'm scared to die.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Only just becomes to learn to crawl.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Can you teach me how to fly?

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Can you keep me in my way?

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll be there all the crowd in my should fall.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll always feel.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I can feel it like the spider-sale.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I can memory in my mouth.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I feel like I'm falling in love.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The bottom's falling down.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Can you see what's up there?

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But I'm falling down in the middle.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I can walk right up to you.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Can you teach me how to fly?

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Can you teach me how to fly?

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
See, I'm scared to die.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Only just becomes to learn to crawl.

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Can you keep me in my way?

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000

53
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,280
tell you more Black Lab about Black Lab but I forgot and I went to the pod save music

54
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,640
network this morning and woo something going wrong there let me see if we're

55
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,520
back online by now that looked like we were having I think that we're either

56
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:52,040
being attacked or it could be that or maybe just a whole bunch of traffic

57
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,440
not actually it seems to be working okay now home let me just see if I can get

58
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,200
to the Black Lab page for a second yeah pod save music network was offline

59
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,440
about an hour ago hmm okay no it seems to be working now that's

60
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,000
groovy special thanks for that track guys are from Montana and they actually

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,680
were on I don't know if there's still on Geffen Records or not but you can

62
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,880

63
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,280
in the show notes today to to their site well it's not very nice today

64
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,320
it was raining this morning so I'm real happy that yesterday was the day

65
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,240
that we went flying and thanks for all the comments now this is not the

66
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,600
first time we've done a flying sound seeing tour on an airplane or during

67
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,520
training exercises and I'd say about 80% of the listeners really dug it a

68
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,800
small percentage thought it was boring you know but hey it was something

69
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,640
different now I have to say though I was severely disappointed by garage band

70
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,720
here's how I did it for those you were wondering I got my eye river this is my

71
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,560
standard sound seeing tour setup by the way if you're listening to serious

72
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,120
stars one or two you didn't hear it yesterday because it took so long to

73
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,120
headed in garage band that we had to run a best of Charlie because I just couldn't

74
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,160
get up in time for the satellite window to for the opening of the satellite

75
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,360
window even let alone the closing so I have the eye river I've got a a

76
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,200
wonderful Electro UHF wireless microphone set so I had the recorder the

77
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,680
I River directly linked up to the receiver of this wireless microphone kit

78
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,520
that wasn't the back of the plane in the in the boot excuse me though I wish

79
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,120
you could say senseo but we're all out I'm drinking tea and I had the the

80
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,720
microphone actually stick right into the into the left side of my of my

81
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,440
headphones I've got a a Clark headset so it you know you get a little bit of

82
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,320
the outside noise but you got a lot of the radio chatter and the intercom and

83
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,080
then so I got home and actually I just let it record from the moment I left

84
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,160
the cottage to the moment I got back so I had over four hours recorded and whoa

85
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,320
this is where it starts to suck first garage band has to import these files

86
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:08,920
now these files were about 250 about 300 megabytes in size I actually had the

87
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,200
chop up them up because garage band would after 15 minutes of importing just one

88
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,080
of the files because I split it up into two garage band would say oh AIFF what kind

89
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,720
of file is this and you have an abort button you know and no other choice okay

90
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,120
abort boom gone so I had to chop it up in the little pieces imported all and

91
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,360
please don't make the mistake of doing an apple apple key asking you a quick

92
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,640
save in garage band because that doesn't yeah sure it saves your file but it

93
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,560
actually doesn't mix down which takes another 10 minutes if it's a long file

94
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,240
or even longer so I'm very disappointed by the process I really do like the quick

95
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,960
ease of editing and the graphic overview that you have but cool just it's it's

96
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,160
no good so next time we'll do it in deck or audacity or maybe even

97
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,400
pro tools it was just horrible experience I wasn't done until about six

98
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,280
PM my time with with all of the editing and go anyway so then we then of

99
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,640
course I still had to do my mix down right which took another 17 minutes for a

100
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:15,480
49 minute show just crazy crap no good no good but it was fun I had a lot of

101
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:20,480
fun flying with Jason and I'm sure we'll be doing some more some more flying

102
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,800
with him he he knows the area really well which is what I liked and you know as

103
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,000
he was pointing out stuff and maybe next week Patricia now go have lunch on the

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,880
island of white it's only a quick 25 minute flight from here so more cool

105
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:39,000
aviation stuff I think I'd seen this before but Ruben sent me the link again

106
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
to arrowseek.com which is a eroseek.com arrowseek you can track I think it's

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,120
a combination of Google Maps I think they're using that API and some other

108
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,840
stuff and you can actually track commercial flights I think you can also

109
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,320
track general aviation flights if a flight plan has been filed so if you're

110
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,960
if you if you love what you were here in yesterday then you might want to check

111
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:10,320
that out because it's definitely for the aviation geeks amongst us and we're on

112
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,040
time recording the show today but I spent oh I'd say a good two and a half

113
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,560
hours and second life once again it's this crack it's crack for my brain I

114
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,880
can't stop I'm I'm really getting into this stuff and when I retire again

115
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,800
I think that if it's still what it is today I'm going to retire into second

116
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,320
life and I'm just gonna live there during the the work day or I'll just live

117
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,760
there you know I'll have my my first life but then I'll really just be living

118
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:44,040
in second life I bought a parcel of land a nice nice hilltop it's

119
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:53,640
some beautiful fur tree was it spruce trees it overlooks an ocean and I bought a

120
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,280
castle yeah I've been out on a splurge and of course you actually buy this

121
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,600
stuff you know it does cost money and I don't know if if second life takes a

122
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,640
transaction fee for each time you buy something from someone else but I think

123
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,880
I spent in total probably about 30 bucks on the land and on the castle but

124
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,320
boy it's beautiful and it has some lock features so you can't get in unless I

125
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,120
let you in so now I can start building and it has multiple levels it's got a

126
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,840
sun deck it's got you know cool towers parked my hovercraft up on the top of

127
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,920
the roof I'm so excited about this stuff and what I'm noticing is that it

128
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,920
really is just an it's an uh well first of all it's a platform because you can do

129
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,840
anything you want and oh shoot I got an I am from so I can't remember who sent me that

130
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,880
but there was actually you can listen to music there was a podcast that I was

131
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,720
able to listen to I don't know if that's coming in streaming or exactly how

132
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,240
that works doesn't matter it works you can sit next to someone who's

133
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,600
listening to something you can listen in with them and it just puts in a whole new

134
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,280
dimension it really removes the necessity almost for the desktop you know

135
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,640
having I am in a pod catch and all that stuff next to each other I just got to

136
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:13,640
say I'm very excited about about this it's it's cool cool stuff so look for me

137
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:19,400
Adam Newman and E U M A N N on second life and if you're lucky I'll invite you to

138
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,520

141
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:47,240
Boston marathon I am proudly wearing my pod show t-shirt and I'm getting a lot

142
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,000
of looks and spectators who are cheering for pod show that you're on the course

143
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,320
you'll hear people shouting words of encouragement and since they don't know

144
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,120
your name they'll look to your t-shirt to see how to identify you so I'm here

145
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,120
you a lot of go pod shows

146
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,800
also a few other runners who are battling these 26.2 miles have been asking me

147
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,600
what pod show is and it's really cool to be able to promote pod casting especially

148
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,000
my fellow New England podcasters who are some of the most talented content

149
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,600
providers out there myself excluding and of course as I run this I'm recording my

150
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,080
own podcast fitpidations and it'll be a pretty intense sound scene tour that

151
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,000
I'll publish for the weekend of the 22nd of April hey thanks again Adam for

152
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,800
everything you and pod show do for pod casting I really appreciate services

153
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,760
like the pod safe music network and podcast alley and while mine is just a

154
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,280
goofy little podcast but running it's risk takers like yourself who really

155
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:06,720
legitimize the media this week I'll not only have podcast listeners listen to

156
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,600
me describe when I'm seeing hearing and feeling as I run this the 110th

personal best time of four hours and 23 minutes or whatever no kidding dude

163
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,360
you're talking while you're running it was so cool that he had the go pod

164
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:52,080
I just want to say one more time that we had offered to sponsor Steve during his

165
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,360
marathon run and he said no I'll wear the t-shirt you don't need to sponsor me

166
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,320
and so we have donated that money to the MS walk that the biddies and CC

167
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,160
Chapman are participating and maybe they'll do some sound seeing and pod casting

168
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,720

172
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,520
his his Steve runner dot com podcast for a while but a marathon will pod

173
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:33,240
casting that has got to be a first hi Adam hey it's Bill Ray from billraydrums.com

174
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:41,120
and I just wanted to call in comment on your recent Delta Sierra

175
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,520
little sound tour it was great I started the pod cast on a left San Diego for

176
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:53,040
ocean side which is about a 40 minute drive and as we're coming up along the

177
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,840
engine trouble that you were having my car was running dangerously low on

178
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:02,000
gas so it was kind of a good thing that I actually heard your engine

179
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,480
trouble and it was sort of a solemn reminder that maybe I should stop and get

180
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,280
some gasoline so that's what I did I pulled into a gas station filled up and then

181
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:20,280
after that all your problems started going away with with the Delta Sierra and

182
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:25,360
as just as I had pulled into my driveway that was when the pod cast ended and

183
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,440
it couldn't have been any better timing it just fit into my whole evening it

184
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,120
was great the whole drive home was a blast even though it was just a bunch of

185
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,880
airplane plain noise it was really really good so anyway keep up the good work

186
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,800

191
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,080

192
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,520
normally I would play it hmm no tubbyfunk on the pod safe music network

193
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,680
what's up with that you got it on my space but not on hold on maybe if I just do

194
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:28,160
tubby oh it seems to be slow still the system well when everyone wakes up

195
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:34,040
in San Francisco I'm sure someone will take a look at it let me see it's waiting

196
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,880
waiting for ever here we go tubby no tubbyfunk hmm okay dude get it up on the

197
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:49,760
pod safe music network it's it's where all the cool kids are yeah briefly about

198
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,120
what happened the engine trouble I of course I also what may not have been

199
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,840
completely apparent to you is that basically one spark plug was blown completely

200
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:04,520
shot to shot the hell didn't work at all and that's what we identified so

201
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,320
thank god for those checks that you do before you actually take off and I think

202
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,880
that this is the same thing that happened in rotted ab when we had to abort the

203
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,480
landing was probably the same spark plug so of course when I got home yes that I

204
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,320
called the wind commander said dude you know I've got a brand new engine complete

205
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,760
overhaul and and this is what's going on it said no this is really typical

206
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:28,760
by the way he did tell me beforehand that he was leaving the original spark plugs in

207
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,240
for the first 50 hours then you take them out then you put new plugs in and then what

208
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,400
happens is these new plugs start sprouting all kinds of pieces of metal and stuff into

209
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,400
your cylinder so you're going to take those out after 40 hours and then you put new ones in

210
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,080
again and then you're completely good to go so this is very typical behavior for an

211
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:51,800
overhauled engine apparently not very pleasurable I have to admit but it's not a it's not a

212
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:58,120
big deal although what is a big deal is these plugs cost about 20 bucks per plug you know so

213
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:03,720
400 bucks later then you're finally all set and everything's rocking it was yeah that was kind

214
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:09,240
of scary I think it was the other day I was talking about we were talking about boot camp

215
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,520
which is the application that apples now made available so you can run windows on your

216
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,280
Intel Mac and I and I was sure that there was another application which actually

217
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:26,920
let you run both macOS and windows at the same time but not in virtual mode but in native mode

218
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,960
I think at least that's what is now I don't have an Intel Mac so I can't test it out

219
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,280
Joel McLaughlin was kind enough to send me the link it's parallels.com

220
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:42,600
P-A-R-A-L-L-E-L-S parallels and if you check it out I don't know if they have a demo they have a demo version

221
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:49,320
yeah they have a download this will actually let you run windows and macOS on the same Intel

222
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:55,480
based Mac so you might want to check that out let me see if they have a demo it's pretty cheap though it's

223
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:02,280
50 it's 4999 and you can oh you can actually run Linux you can run macOS X and you can run

224
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,280
Windows and apparently all at the same time so if anyone wants to check that out let me know what your

225
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:13,000
experiences are because that would actually sway me to buy a new Intel what are they calling

226
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:23,800
Macbook Macbook Pro whatever the on the flying tip Paul Smith says Adam on that sound

227
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:30,760
scene to where you did yesterday I swear the air traffic controller sounded just like Roger Smalls

228
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:37,160
that must have been the fair oaks were I went back and listen you listen to yesterday's show again

229
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,760
I have to admit it did sound a little bit like Roger

230
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,600
I was coming on coming to visit you in London on the 29 but I hear that you change it now

231
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,760
there's some day and I can't get any more time up work is only change you can change everyone's

232
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:12,440
arrangements because I'll let's make you a scrapped book and some clothes that I want you to sign

233
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,080
desperately if you want you can come around to mine with rounds for cups of hours

234
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:23,800
I've got some fondant fancies and some jammy rings if you want to try some of those and it's not

235
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:33,560
nice and now Roger Roger I'm so disappointed that you can't make it and by the way I've heard

236
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:39,880
that there are now Roger Smalls T-shirts in circulation and that several of the UK podcasters

237
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,920
who will be coming to hang out with us at the draft and darts hang out will be wearing these

238
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,720
T-shirts and of course the question is is one of them actually Roger Smalls I doubt it but I do

239
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,680
like the idea so apparently Roger won't be showing up it's a bummer man would have loved to

240
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,280
have had you there and here's where it's taking place if you're in the UK you don't have to be a

241
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,560
podcaster now you can be a you could be someone who wants the podcast you could be someone who just

242
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:10,040
wants to hang out meet podcasters meet your favorite one there's a wiki or I think that's at

243
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,400
Britcaster.com there's a wiki and there's about 20 22 people signed up now who are coming so it's

244
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,480
this coming Sunday it's going to be in London it's at the brick layers arms and that's in

245
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:27,560
Fitz Rovia London you sure that's not in Belarus Fitz Rovia if that's Fitz Rovia

246
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:35,000
Belarus for the UK podcasters draft and darts so I think we have a room upstairs or in the back

247
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,240
and yes there are actually darts there and of course some draft to be here although we'll have to

248
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,760
learn how to drink it without the head and looking forward to meeting everybody there and Roger should

249
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:54,360
you be able to make it you know that you are more than welcome I just had a note here what's this about oh

00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:09,000

252
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:18,360
create podcasting a podcasting place within second life if you haven't by the way if you're thinking

00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:56,360
he sends altitude and a slate buzzing noise he's sad of quickly but then relaxed his dreams

00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:03,080
for slowly becoming true but he still fell apprehensive anyone would he thought with the main guitar

268

show about uh well you were talking about the enhanced version of the i guess pod safe music network

302
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:23,160
and i was thinking it would be great somehow if say we could combine or not we if there was a

303
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:31,160
plugin or some type of a api or some type of a web app for people like me who have websites

304
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:39,800
and who have people submitting music to them on a regular basis it would be great if that music

305
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:47,320
was at the same time submitted to the pod safe music network that way they wouldn't have to

306
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:53,160
submit it on one side and then see oh hey the pod safe music network was suggested here

307
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:58,440
i'm gonna have to go submit my music somewhere else it just be nice to be able to have it done

308
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,320
all in one place you know that's a question and it's something that will bring up on the dev

309
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:09,400
cast which is for developers and if you haven't uh checked it out and subscribed yet yet to one

310
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:14,440
today actually i think will give you the chance to get into pod show plus and the uh and the pod

311
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,480
uh pod cast literally network and of course a part of that is now the integration of the pod safe

312
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,880
music network i don't you know first of all it would be a great thing for developers to work on

313
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,920
but i don't know because you know there's a lot of stuff that you've gotten you have to

314
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,320
well it's not it's not a hard process but you have to maybe you want to read through what it means

315
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,520
and so we could totally do it and we'll put it on the dev cast devcast.podshow.com

316
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,720
we'll throw it up in the air and see what people think um i presume that you have a submission form

317
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:49,480
of some sorts but maybe it'll just be easier just to link back and forth i don't i just think about it

318
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:55,480
but it's an interesting idea and it would be a great tie-in to slink all of these wonderful things

319
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:02,040
not only is there the band websites there's the website of my podcast and other music podcast

320
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:07,240
like it but then there would be of course links back to the pod safe music network

321
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,560
well those are my thoughts about that uh i don't know you've probably heard them all before but

322
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:18,680
you know hey throwing it out there and uh please if you have an opportunity stop by constant

323
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:27,000
Columbus.com give us some feedback let us well listen to the music more importantly and uh thank you

324
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:33,000
no thank you good thinking i like it a lot because tying all that stuff together is what it's going

325
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,600
to be all about i think and as you'll see what we're doing with the pod safe music network

326
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,120
we're really expanding the capabilities for artists and how any of they can really

327
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,200
use their their pages now to communicate well not yet but it's coming soon it's just hasn't surfaced yet

328
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,880
you can use their pages to communicate different ways you know to have feedback forums comments

329
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,200
you know all this stuff so we're definitely working on it and with the developers who are bringing in

330
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,200
i think that maybe we'll come up with some cool APIs and things that will be able to tie all that stuff

331
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:08,680
together so um yes they stay subscribed for sure hey great news we've got a brand new podcast on the

332

ago uh 28 years ago uh no 29 years ago oh man and i actually walked around with a little

338
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:56,280
tube of graphite my pocket you know whenever my trucks got kind of jammed up or cruddy because of course

339
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,880
it couldn't you know we couldn't really afford the good stuff and i was living in the Netherlands so we

340
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:07,960
had kind of shitty boards but i still have um scars on my left elbow on my left knee i had a

341
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:13,480
huge crash up once while we were on vacation in in Texas going down to hill and i tried to take

342
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:19,960
up the same space as a an 18 wheeler i didn't hit the 18 wheeler but i wiped out so bad i remember

343
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,960
my parents trying to keep me awake they were afraid i was slipping into a coma so yeah

344
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,320
no totally love your your videos man it's awesome stuff i haven't been on a board in a long time

345
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,240

346
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,360
perfect floor for it i'm feeling that someone has got to have a board and someone must have

353
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:22,280
does your podcast sound like this make it sound like this take the audiobooks content crash course

354
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:28,280
in just one weekend learn the tips tricks and time tested techniques of audio professionals

355
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:34,520
the audio looks content crash course how did KQED studios in San Francisco for more information

356
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:43,000
go to audiolux.org that's audioleuxie.org and some very interesting news popped on my radar

357
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,840
it's taken a while and i i think they're ahead of Microsoft now but if you use Gmail and you use the

358
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,240
spell check feature which i use often because it does you know almost any language you can write in

359
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:00,760
it now actually recognizes the word podcast yes good job Google now give me more gigabyte

360
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:23,080
yeah hello Adam this is Tokyo Dan of what's happening in Tokyo

361
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:29,320
i listen to your DSC 369 today and during the metro sexual moment you talked about japanese

362
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:34,920
men and you also mentioned me so i thought i'd respond some japanese men have long been

363
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:40,040
metro sexuals long before the word came into use and some of them just can't pass a mirror

364
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:45,000
a window without checking themselves out although i'm used to it now i used to marvel at how

365
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,040
a lot of the young guys over here would be in the train facing the window and prepping shamelessly

366
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:55,960
you know the japanese are famous for detail well it applies here too they would spend an

367
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:01,720
awful lot of time on one little strand of hair making sure it stood up or laid just right something

368
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,520
also been noticing lately is that a lot of young japanese are losing that nice cool all of

369
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:13,640
complexion to a rosy ruddy cheek then slightly greasy skin complexion like so many Caucasians have

370
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,920
acne is becoming more prevalent and i blame it on the american fast food chains that have been here for

371
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,360
the last 30 years and the greasy food they've been serving and this has nothing to do with men

372
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:29,880
but you should see the young women over here lately they do their makeup on the public trains i mean

373
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:36,200
curling their eyelashes plucking eyebrows everything the older people really get upset about this

374
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,240
and i wonder what these young women would do if i brushed my teeth and shaved well on the train

375
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:46,600
i guess if i did i'd probably start a trend anyway i'm going to email you a link about the

376
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:53,560
cultural feminization of japanese men and i'll check you on dsc 370 so take it easy at him

377
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:59,160
yo Tokyo Dan thank you very much how cool is this podcasting you know we we hear about

378
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:07,240
japanese men becoming complete metro sexuals i put out the call on the on the Charlie and one day

379
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:12,680
later i get an answer and learn something that had absolutely no idea what's going on Tokyo Dan

380
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,680

422
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:10,520
party tunes in the pot of music network uh... that is assuming that uh... you can get to it

423
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:16,200
it seems to be okay now uh... so please send some stuff in i really want to jam it out tomorrow

424
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,000
it's been it's been a really interesting week also today later today we'll have another dev

425
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,880
cast which will put up online uh... this one will include golden tickets for people to come

426
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:31,560
into the to the to the beta of pod show plus in the pod cast delivery network it's intended

427
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,160
for developers that's uh... the audience that we'd like to bring in first because their

428
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:42,040
audience who can actually change stuff and make it better and if you know html and php that's

429
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,600
probably going to be enough if you keep up with the current web you know web stuff then you'll

430
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:51,640
be able to participate and help out and of course use everything and break everything yeah

431
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,800
mm-hmm love it

432
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:59,000
uh... so that'll be up later today that dev cast because Andrew grummit whose own mom

433
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:03,640
has had some uh... some health issues she's doing okay he's visiting her in Chicago today

434
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,400
so he's getting on our plane early this morning now since Andrew is still is doing all the

435
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,640
de-gap stuff he sent the instructions and it's not hard because we have a great interface

436
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,520
you know to uh... ticket to to put you know for the golden ticket campaigns

437
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,520
but uh... i i'm not comfortable doing that to be honest with you so

438
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:28,520
probably look for it sometime uh... early afternoon San Francisco time uh... by then

439
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:33,320
Andrew will be in uh... Chicago and we'll be able to insert everything get it all up and running

440
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:39,240
so we'll probably let in uh... and so i'm somewhere between five and fifteen developers on

441
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,400
today's golden ticket and you will know if you want it'll be very apparent

442
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,720
