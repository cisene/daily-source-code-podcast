5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:34,560
and listening to podcast is a revolutionary act. However, you have to realize every time you do it,

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:41,280
you are taking one step closer towards the destruction of commercial radio as we know it

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,520

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:22,960
What did you see? It's all I want out of here, guys. I was gonna say it's a lie away.

17
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:34,320

18
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,520

Just what the doctor ordered, the sweetest sea by this love machine, it is Fubar Friday.

23
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,520
Hey everybody, how you doing it is, the first of December.

24
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,520
So what do you say, bunny bunny rabbit rabbit something like that?

25
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,520
Very good to have you all along for the ride just before the weekend.

26
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,520
Just before the weekend, crap here in the UK.

27
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,520
It's going to be rainy today and Sunday.

28
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,520
We have a true gale force winds coming our way.

29
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,520
And I missed all this.

30
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,520
Somewhere there's going to be a slot in the middle known as Saturday amongst the population.

31
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,520
And that's when I'm going to have to go brave the elements to go pick up the the ailing lady Patricia.

32
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,520
Yeah, she was supposed to come home last night from her rehearsals for dancing with the stars.

33
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,520
And she's been in Rotterdam staying with the sister.

34
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,520
And she took ill Wednesday night.

35
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,520
And she's really hurting all over and she absolutely cannot get on a commercial flight.

36
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,520
And let's someone literally carried her bag and hurts the carry of bag even.

37
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,520
So Captain Dan and I are gearing up to brave the elements to see what we can make the crossing on Saturday.

38
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,520
We should be able to just kind of work it in between two stored front.

39
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,520
So it's Mr. Mom all over again.

40
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,520
Today though we had the big clean up day today.

41
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,520
So I came by and she helped me out.

42
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,520
Christina has actually been doing a pretty good job.

43
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,520
And I know that we've been doing a good job because the real estate agent came by.

44
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,520
She wanted to show the house to somebody.

45
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,520
Of course, you know, we're leaving in just four weeks from now.

46
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,520
We're actually leaving this cottage to for another one.

47
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,520
And then I said, you know, I'm sorry, my wife's been gone for four days.

48
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
And neither she nor client could believe.

49
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,520
How incredibly good the place looks.

50
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,520
She said, well, if my husband had been alone for four days,

51
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,520
it would be a real big style.

52
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,520
Jim's from there.

53
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,520
You get it.

54
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,520
That's not to listen to.

55
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,520
You said, he said, I said, you conversation put that just to put.

56
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
Yeah.

57
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,520
Yeah.

58
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,520
Chris Moiles friend.

59
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
Don't leave.

60
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
He can play it back if you want.

61
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
Not going to be put from but I don't believe I said.

62
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
Chris Moiles was against podcast.

63
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,520
And I said he was an asshole, which is a totally different thing.

64
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,520
And it looks up in the office of me.

65
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
Oh man.

66
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:41,520
I love it when you guys are high, drunk, stone, and calling is fantastic.

67
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,520
Please continue to do that, particularly you folks here in the UK.

68
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,520
You seem to be more prone to that.

69
00:06:46,520 --> 00:07:03,520
I'm going to be rolling along really fast today.

70
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,520
I got lots of music for you.

71
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,520
I mean an incredible amount of music.

72
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
I'm going to go way overboard today.

73
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,520
I can guarantee you that right now because I know one song is particularly long,

74
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,520
but I think you will really, really enjoy it.

75
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,520
And I just want to blow through it all.

76
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:23,520
And I do have something, well, in the final thought of the week is where we'll really slow down

77
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
and talk for a second.

78
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,520
But first, let's just scan the globe and take a look at what's coming to.

79
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,520

Little news mashup.

83
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,520

91
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,520

92
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
high-tech etiquette.

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,520
Cities like London and Dubai will be scraping more music owned by record labels behind a new

military recruitment video game in the Balkan state as its people prepared to welcome world

95
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,520
leaders.

loud and unbalanced world news mashup.

111
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,520

112
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:23,520

Hey Adam, this is Terry from Little Ruts Writing Hood.

115
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,520
You might remember me, you might not.

116
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,520
If you do, great.

117
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,520
If not, guess what.

118
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,520
I don't have a boyfriend that's going to come after you for calling me.

119
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
So anytime you want to pick up the phone go for it.

120
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,520
I do have a gift for you.

121
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,520
This is my Christmas gift to you.

122
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,520
A little bit early, but I figured since you're doing Christmas stuff already so

123
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,520
mine.

124
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:58,520
As the pod father you keep us informed with your opinions so non-conformed to turn off

125
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,520
the DSC we simply cannot foresee, entertained each and every mourn

126
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,520
perceivably.

127
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,520
Addicted to the Charlie ourselves we find.

128
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,520
However, missing Patricia is no longer a state of mind.

129
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:20,520
As of now another day rolls around and the Chacha 507 is where we're found.

130
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,520
Keep up the great shows and the pod show stuff.

131
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:30,520
And by the way, even show 999 will never be enough.

132
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,520
Enjoy Adam.

133
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,520
It's a great season.

134
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,520
You have a great thing going on and I'm glad to be a part of it.

135
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
Bye.

136
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
Thank you.

137
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
That's so sweet.

138
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,520
By the way, I apologize for what I said earlier.

139
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,520
I really tried to limit myself on swearing.

140
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,520
So apologies if that offended you.

141
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,520
Now in the other hand, fuck me with the chainsaw.

142
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,520
I'm okay with as long as it's gentle.

143
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,520
I'm okay.

144
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,520
I don't know who this is but stop fucking calling Disneyland's home.

145
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,520
Hey Adam, it's Jack from GetJack.

146
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,520
GetJack.

148
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,520
And I thought I'd have to horn in on Jersey Todd's territory.

149
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
So it's just a song.

150
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,520
It's on the Pods Life Music Network.

151
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,520
These guys have been there for a while.

152
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,520
But they just posted some new stuff.

153
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,520
It's my little radio.

154
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,520
This one's called Leave the Light on for a food bar Friday.

155
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:27,520
There's something in front of me doing.

156
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
It's so.

157
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:34,520
Since this is this song, it's been hit on the institutional C sharp.

158
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,520
If you like of design, let the lights turn golden right off.

159
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,520
If it makes the last sound, it's really good.

160
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,520
If I have something to talk about, let's kwel.

161
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,520
Sure.

162
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,520
Makes the sound make the sound best.

163
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,520
It's just my concern.

164
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
Both of them dance.

165
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,520
If you make it pronounce, intersection.

166
00:11:49,520 --> 00:12:19,520
I'm ready, do you want to go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

167
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:49,520
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, out, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. go, no, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

168
00:12:49,520 --> 00:13:02,800
You're going to go again, you can't leave me for all night

169
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,920
Sing no one can find out that's what we've been here

170
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,880
Just tell me, I'll have said it, say what I want to hear

171
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,880
Just pull me in closer like no one ever did

172
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,880
In my hands, if you shake it, I won't let it on again

173
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,880
Will you leave the world alone for me?

174
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:39,880
Will you make sure I can fall asleep?

175
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:45,880
Will you leave the world alone for me?

176
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,880
Do you want to go again?

177
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:57,880
You can leave me for all night

178
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:04,880
Will you leave the world alone for me?

179
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,880
Will you leave the world alone for me?

180
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,880
Will you make sure I can fall asleep?

181
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:24,880
Will you leave the world alone for me?

182
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,880
Will you leave the world alone for me?

183
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,880
Will you make sure I can fall asleep?

184
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:43,880
Will you leave the world alone for me?

185
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:49,880
Will you make sure I can fall asleep?

186
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:59,880
Will you leave the world alone for me?

187
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Will you leave the world alone for me?

188
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,880
Are you feeling now?

189
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,880
Are you nice and fubard?

190
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,880
Oh, Todd, Sergio Zita, don't worry.

191
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,880
Of course I'll get to you, please don't worry about it, buddy.

192
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,880
Please chill out there, take a seat.

193
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
About 15 minutes.

194
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,880
What do you get when you put two guys in an orange room?

195
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,880
Add a pair of mics?

196
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,880
A mixer?

197
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,880
A compressor?

198
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
A couple of sets of headphones?

199
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,880
PC?

200
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
Some software?

201
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
John, you're killing me.

202
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
What do you get?

203
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,880
Well, little thing I like to call bloodthirsty vegetarians.

204
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,880
And what my friend is that?

205
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
It's a podcast.

206
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,880
Oh, so it's one of those new internet radio things?

207
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,880
Yeah.

208
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
What do you do?

209
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,880
You talk about politics, media, culture, and philosophy?

210
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
Yeah.

211
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,880
And you play music?

212
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
That's right.

213
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,880
But why is it called bloodthirsty vegetarians?

214
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
Well, because we are vegetarians.

215
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
But one of the show to be about more.

216
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
So it is.

217
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
Groovy.

218
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
I'm hip.

219
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,880
Let's do it.

220
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
What we already do, man?

221
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,880
Not dig this.

222
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,880
You can find us and subscribe at www.buddybedge.com.

223
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,880
Solid.

224
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,880
That's bloodthirsty vegetarians.

225
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
Solid.

226
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Solid is a rock, rock, rock.

227
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
Oh, yes.

228
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,880
Of course, if you want an easy way to find any podcasts that you hear about anywhere.

229
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
Just go to podshow.com, go to the search box.

230
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,880
And you'll see how easy we've made that.

231
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,880
And of course, you can collect all of your favorite shows.

232
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,880
Even your favorite episodes.

233
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
Put them into channels.

234
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
Have those show up on your iPod.

235
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Damn.

236
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,880
We've got some exciting stuff.

237
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,880
Oh, yes.

238
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,880
Speaking of which, sexy fruit talk.

239
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,880
Hello, Mr. Yannahau.

240
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
Hey, Adam.

241
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,880
Jennifer here.

242
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,880
It's time for another finger-looking Friday.

243
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,880
And guess what?

244
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
Why?

245
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
We're all alone today.

246
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,880
Yeah.

247
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
But never mind the kitchen.

248
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,880
Let's step over to the wet bar for a cocktail.

249
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
Oh, yes.

250
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
Please.

251
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
That's beautiful.

252
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,880
Today's recipe is a little bit girly.

253
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,880
So it's actually perfect for you.

254
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,880
Hey.

255
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,880
It's a leechy martini from our Gilded Fork mixologist, Damian Sim.

256
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,880
Oh, okay.

257
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,880
And it adds the perfect touch to holiday festivities, especially if you're serving an Asian

258
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
menu.

259
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,880
Now, for this drink, we recommend canned leechy fruit because you'll need the syrup for

260
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
the cocktail.

261
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,880
And you can usually find those in the Asian section of your grocery store or in Asian markets.

262
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,880
Ready?

263
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,880
Make sure you have a three-piece cocktail shaker and a clean martini glass.

264
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Oh.

265
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,880
I know how your boys are.

266
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,880
You're going to take an ounce of leechy lecure.

267
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,880
Two-thirds of an ounce of vanilla flavored vodka, a dash of clontro.

268
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,880
Two ounces of leechy syrup from the canned fruit and the remaining leechy foods for garnish.

269
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,880
The trick here is to chill all of your ingredients, including the garnishes and the glassware

270
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
and the shaker.

271
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,880
So just stick them in their refrigerator until everything is well chilled.

272
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,880
Then fill your cocktail shaker about three quarters full with large ice cubes.

273
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,880
You want the most surface area possible.

274
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,880
Then you're going to add in the leechy lecure, the vodka, the quontro, and the leechy syrup.

275
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Shake and chill the cocktail shaker with firm and vigorous strokes, I think you know what I mean.

276
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,880
Until your hands can't take the cold and then a little bit longer.

277
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,880
After all the ingredients are blended, place a leechy fruit on a cocktail pick, put it in the glassware,

278
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,880
and strain the ingredients into the martini glass.

279
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,880
If you've shaken well, your reward will be a wonderful textural experience filled with

280
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,880
tiny little ice chips floating on the surface of the cocktail.

281
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,880
Now, Chef Mark will be here next week to talk about some nibbles for the holidays.

282
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,880
And in the meantime, I'll be featuring different kinds of holiday entertaining ideas

283
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,880
and a special show in December on the art of the cocktail.

284
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,880
At foodphilosophy.podshow.com.

285
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Have a great weekend, Adam.

286
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
Jennifer, are you sexy?

287
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
Minks you.

288
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,880
Love it.

289
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
Love it.

290
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,880
The double entendre is the sexy talker.

291
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,880
Normally I'd say Bon Appetit, but I guess now it's, uh,

292
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
score, roast to your health.

293
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,880
This is Paul Marshall, and this is a promo for the podcast novel 7th son.

294
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,880
Oh, my God.

295
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,880
7th son, book two, is about halfway through, and it has been fantastic.

296
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,880
But it's just gone supernova.

297
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,880
It has just hit record levels.

298
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,880
If you are not listening to 7th son, then get over to JC Hutchins.net now.

299
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,880
That's JC Hutchins.net.

300
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,880
You can find it in iTunes.

301
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,880
You can find it anywhere else in any other podcast in directory.

302
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,880
But JC Hutchins.net.

303
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
Go there.

304
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
Download it.

305
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
Listen to it.

306
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
Now.

307
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
But what is still available?

308
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,880
You can go back.

309
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,880
You can download book one.

310
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,880
We're about halfway through book two, and all my God, it is so good.

311
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
You must download it.

312
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,880
If you don't do anything else today, go to JC Hutchins.net.

313
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,880
You know, I, I played this promo for a number of reasons.

314
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Uh, the primary one being that I love it.

315
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
I just, oh, sorry.

316
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,880
I absolutely love it when listeners send in their promos.

317
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,880
And it doesn't have to be elaborately produced.

318
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,880
And this was clearly, uh, this sound like a phone call, even.

319
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,880
What this was recorded on a phone or a really crappy device.

320
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,880
But did you hear that kind?

321
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
Did you hear how into this he is?

322
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
Now, I can see Mark Yosimat.

323
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
Yark Motion.

324
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,880
No shame.

325
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
No shame, Odey, the memc of.

326
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,880
I can see him steaming right now.

327
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:37,880
I think he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he he, he, he he, he he, he he.

328
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
You know what?

329
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,880
You know what?

330
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
It's because I believe in this type of content.

331
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,880
This is a category of content that is absolutely going to explode.

332
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,880
We're already seeing that with, with Shadow Falls, of course, Scott Sigler.

333
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,720
is a fantastic job, it's, you know,

334
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,480
it's third audio novel by now.

335
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,320
And the seventh song I have listened to it,

336
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,800
I like it very much.

337
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,720
I think that this, it takes a while, you know,

338
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,640
it takes a while for something like this to catch on,

339
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,360
it takes a lot of effort, but the community

340
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,080
around these types of stories,

341
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,680
and this form of audio storytelling

342
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,200
is really, really big.

343
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,320
And I give them shit,

344
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,320
but Mark Yoshimura Namcoff actually

345
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,400
is doing some fantastic work in this area.

346
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,800
Outside of Shadow Falls,

347
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,680
I has a, where's my fucking latte?

348
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,280
And number one with a bullet,

349
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,120
please listen to this show.

350
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,720
And I stress this upon you,

351
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,120
not just because I play a cameo in it, of course.

352
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,760
I had him, it's you, it's her, it's who,

353
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,400
it's a so-fi Friday morning,

354
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,040
and not surprised, you're not here.

355
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,160
Very overcast,

356
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,000
there's some activity, but not much,

357
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,440
see, got to see her sitting in the hanger here.

358
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,440
Just to say that I have a feeling you said

359
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,960
on the podcast, we're going to be in San Francisco quite soon,

360
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,360
but if you're around next week,

361
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,080
journey next week,

362
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,240
know, the week after,

363
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,520
we're commencing about what will be,

364
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,680
about the tenths thereabouts,

365
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,120
we can have our helicopter here, our twin squirrel,

366
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,320
with our million and a half dollars worth

367
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,240
of train modeling laser scanner on it,

368
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,760
we'll be working out of here,

369
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,640
most of the week, serving some railway line

370
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,640
to our London.

371
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,040
And it's pretty cool equipment,

372
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,600
real casting edge technology stuff,

373
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
genuinely rocket science stuff.

374
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,880
And if you happen to be around,

375
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,920
come and have a look and we'll show you how it works,

376
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,120
and show you some of the things that it does,

377
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,120
but if you're in San Francisco,

378
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,640
it'll be warmer than here,

379
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,640
than I did say a bit dry anyway.

380
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,400
And look after stuff,

381
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,880
see you at the very front of these days, bye.

382
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,240
Yeah, you, thank you very much.

383
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,440
And I always appreciate you looking out for the Delta share,

384
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,240
the old girl, you know,

385
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,400
she needs a retention,

386
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,080
if you just give it a little pad once and again on there,

387
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,000
on the, on the, on the calling or something,

388
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,120
you know, just make her feel good.

389
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,440
I'd really appreciate that.

390
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,480
Unfortunately, I will be in San Francisco

391
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,800
when you have your twin squirrel,

392
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,680
which is a Eurocopter for those of you thinking,

393
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,400
what the hell is you gonna fly now?

394
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,960
And actually, you know, if, if you let me fly,

395
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,520
I do have a license, you know, for rotary aircraft.

396
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,040
If you let me give me some stick time,

397
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,440
I would even, I'd consider changing my plans.

398
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,160
What day is it today?

399
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,320
It's Friday.

400
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,160
But they Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,

401
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:16,000
food about Friday and it's final fun to phone the week.

402
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Now, my timing is all off today,

403
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,760
because I still have Jersey taught on the way.

404
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,280
And then I had a song that I really wanted to share with you guys today,

405
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,680
which I'm gonna play next.

406
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,360
That timing's off because the folks on serious sidelight,

407
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,280
channel 102, the star's channel,

408
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,800
will not be able to hear all of that.

409
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:36,800
In fact, you're pretty much gonna be kicked off of the show,

410
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,520
in about a minute from now.

411
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,880
So the timing's all off, but here's what I was trying to,

412
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,280
trying to work out for the final thought of the week.

413
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,440
And it's a very touchy subject, very difficult to discuss.

414
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,960
And I don't think I can really find the right words,

415
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,560
but I think the song will say a lot about my feelings about the topic.

416
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,080
You know, this, this Michael Richards video tape

417
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,520
that, of course, was captured by TMZ.com,

418
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,120
which is an America online company.

419
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,920
And as far as I know, it was played all over the U.S.

420
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,560
with the dreaded N word.

421
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,360
And I've said before that I'm really a little unclear

422
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,720
on how it happened that words and certain gestures became,

423
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,040
well, basically illegal and you just can't,

424
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,240
you can't do them, you can't talk them, you can't speak them.

425
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,640
You know what, I'm just gonna talk some shit

426
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,000
for like 13 more seconds while I raise my right hand

427
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,720
above my head, spread my fingers, and wave goodbye.

428
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,160
To all our friends on serious satellite radio,

429
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,760
I'll see you guys after the weekend.

430
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,080
Unfortunately, they're not gonna hear all the cool shit

431
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,880
and I'm glad you're hanging around.

432
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,440
So yesterday, we were having a conversation.

433
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,800
And by the way, I found it highly interesting

434
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,800
that although no one ever dares utter the N word,

435
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,200
anywhere.

436
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,440
This piece of video got aired on mainstream media

437
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,040
in many cases without bleeps over the N word.

438
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,880
And of course this, and I don't know if the controversy

439
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,320
around Michael Richard's video was that big outside of the U.S.

440
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,840
Of course it received mentions, but really,

441
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,200
don't think it was that much a topic of conversation.

442
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,560
Certainly not here in the U.K.,

443
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,120
but I know from talking with Patricia

444
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,040
that it hasn't been in the Netherlands either.

445
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,280
So that's kind of the just gives you an idea

446
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,280
that it's just not such a big deal.

447
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,280
Well, they don't care that much about what happened

448
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,080
in other countries.

449
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,480
See, I told you it's gonna be very hard

450
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,880
to get all this out right.

451
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,840
So anyway, so yesterday I'm having a conversation

452
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,360
and I realized that even in this private,

453
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,160
one-on-one conversation with someone

454
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,440
who I've known for, you know,

455
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,840
I've got, I don't know, 20 years

456
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,800
that we were talking about this video

457
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,120
and neither of us use the word.

458
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,560
And even in a descriptive form, just to say,

459
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,360
oh, you know, when Michael Richard said,

460
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,240
fill in the blank.

461
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,520
And I'm trying to, last night, I was trying to figure it out,

462
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,800
you know, is it because, you know,

463
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,840
if you use that word, even though this friend of mine knows

464
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,000
that I'm not racist, I grew up in the Netherlands,

465
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,640
you know, when the Netherlands wasn't racist,

466
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,800
I think they've changed a little bit over the years.

467
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:42,080
I went to school when I at West Virginia to university

468
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,680
and my roommate, I was an African-American kid

469
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,840
from Trenton, New Jersey.

470
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,400
And having grown up in the Netherlands,

471
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,720
this is about 50% white 50% black,

472
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,600
the Salem College, Salem, West Virginia.

473
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,320
And nothing really dawned on me.

474
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,280
I just kind of, you know, this was Thai, Thai Hamilton.

475
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,800
And what was kind of fun is me coming from Amsterdam

476
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,080
and him coming from Trenton and his own community.

477
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,720
When we both put out our boom boxes with cassette tapes back

478
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,480
in the day, we turned them on,

479
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,240
we basically had the same music,

480
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,840
which was very cool.

481
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,160
And we had an immediate bond.

482
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,840
And I hung out with a lot of his friends,

483
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,400
where my friends actually at school

484
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,240
because he had more people that had come along

485
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,000
with him from, or that he knew from the Trenton area.

486
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,760
And I, of course, coming from Amsterdam

487
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,080
had almost no one there that I knew or understood

488
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,560
where I was coming from at all.

489
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:43,360
And, you know, so totally oblivious to any color.

490
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,000
And then I thought that was it,

491
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
last week in San Francisco, I was watching something

492
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,800
on the biography channel, I think it was.

493
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,400
Or it was A&E biography, that's what it is.

494
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,560
And it was about Bill Cosby and about the Cosby family.

495
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,480
And there was a very interesting comment

496
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,840
about, you know, the setting of the Cosby show, of course,

497
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,280
which was, you know, how could this actually have happened

498
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,200
on television that we had the incredibly unlikely scenario

499
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,200
of a rich African-American upper class family,

500
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,520
a, was it a doctor husband, a lawyer wife?

501
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,760
But what they said in the, in this biography piece

502
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,360
was the American audience was completely colorblind.

503
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,040
They just love the Cosby's.

504
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,480
It was the family they wanted to be.

505
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,560
And when you think about that, it's absolutely true.

506
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,360
You know, and I cannot remember ever having a thought

507
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,560
crossing my mind about color.

508
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,320
You know, the Cosby's were fun.

509
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,520
You know, you love them.

510
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,440
You love the way they sat around and sang songs.

511
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,400
The colorblindness, yeah, I think there was absolutely true.

512
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,400
So what is it with this word that we don't even utter?

513
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,960
We just won't speak the word.

514
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,040
And therefore it's so incredibly evil

515
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,840
as Michael Richards has found out.

516
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,840
And I think the, you know, I think it comes from embarrassment

517
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,880
and whereas, as far as I know, the concept of,

518
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,240
give the slaves or the descendants of the slaves,

519
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,200
I'm just paraphrasing.

520
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,560
I don't even know if this is fucking true or not.

521
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,520
They deserve 40 acres in a mule.

522
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,760
Spike Lee always talks about that type of soon.

523
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,120
There's some grain of truth in it.

524
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,760
Well, I don't think that actually happened.

525
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,440
But crap, I talked all the way through the final thought

526
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,280
of the day music.

527
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,040
Well, let me just continue.

528
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,160
That, that of course didn't happen.

529
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,760
But instead, I think that we've given, you know,

530
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,560
we've decided that there's this word

531
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,600
that we will not utter ever in our lives

532
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,600
because it is the, it reminds us of the injustice,

533
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,880
the racism of, and this is only 40 years ago,

534
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,880
the racism was, you know, there was a lot of segregation

535
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,600
still in the United States.

536
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,160
And of course, all the way back to slavery

537
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,920
and that this is like our punishment

538
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,400
that we don't get to use a word.

539
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,240
And of course, it's completely inadequate.

540
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,160
It's completely inadequate as a solution

541
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,000
because that seems to be the only thing

542
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,880
when it comes to race these days.

543
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,560
All I hear about is this word you can't use.

544
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,440
And by the way, the word gets taunted

545
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,760
in the white man's face all the time.

546
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,280
Now Kanye West, number one hit record.

547
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,200
You know, African American culture in general uses this word.

548
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
But we're not allowed to use the word.

549
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,120
And I'm not, I don't give a shit

550
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
because I don't care about it.

551
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,240
I don't need to use this word.

552
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,360
But to me, why are we talking about it?

553
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,200
And why are we so worried about a fucking word

554
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,960
when the real problem is truly racism?

555
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,400
That's really what the issues are about.

556
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,880
And it just, yeah, I don't know, man.

557
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,000
It just really bugs me.

558
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,560
It seems like all the attention, all the focus,

559
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,320
that the media puts on racial issues

560
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,120
surrounds the use of language.

561
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,840
And that is just totally wrong.

562
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,920
Does this make any sense?

563
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,720
Because I feel like I'm a little bit lost.

564
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,400
But anyway, I'm going completely non-pod-safe

565
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,760
to express the point.

566
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,040
I'll even go to jail for this one

567
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,760
because it is the legend's TV wonder.

568
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,840
Listen to the words.

569
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,480
Let him burn into your mind.

570
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:46,720
That man got out of a ship on the first column of the strip.

571
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,960
He was a frontman.

572
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,440
Who will most of the trains keep on tracking that first thing

573
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,840
by the hell man.

574
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,000
We take to meet you all a lot.

575
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,440
To the magic colors, we have blue and white.

576
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,760
We are must be given, but see that we're different.

577
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,920
But with justice, not for all men.

578
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:20,920
This could be a repeat of it's time for us.

579
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,200
This promise made for all men.

580
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,800
Hot surgery.

581
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,000
The first one's success for me.

582
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,760
It's time for us to be given, but see that we're different.

583
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,000
We're must be given, but see that we're different.

584
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
We're must be given, but see that we're different.

585

We're must be given, but see that we're different.

We're must be given, but see that we're different.

We're must be given, but see that we're different.

588

We're must be given, but see that we're different.

589
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
We're must be given, but see that we're different.

590
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
We're must be given, but see that we're different.

591
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
With better nature, all are not.

592
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
To magic colors, we have blue and white.

593
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
We're must be given, but see that we're different.

594
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
But justice, not for all men.

595
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
This could be a repeat of it's time for us to be given.

596
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
This promise made for all men.

597
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
We're must be given, but see that we're different.

598
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
We're must be given, but see that we're different.

599
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
We're must be given, but see that we're different.

Please, of course.

You think I was going to forget you?

881
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:29,000
You're on a black magic motion to rock this mother out.

882
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
You're on a piece.

883
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Don't bend that girl to try to kill Belle out.

00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Yeah.

888
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Just in time.

889
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Yeah.

890
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
What's up, Adam?

891
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It's Jersey Todd.

892
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
The official musicologist of the Cha Cha.

893
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
And I know where my segment usually is on the Daily Source Code.

894
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Generally less than five minutes from now.

895
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
You're going to do that.

896
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Click, click, click of your lighter.

897
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And well, the song I have for you today may give you some pause.

898
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,320
Today, I've got a song about the E.V.s of drug used called the Pot song from Dan

899
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,000
Costello out of New York.

900
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
It's got a really, really great message.

901
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,840
But frankly, I can't get past the really green and leafy chorus that just makes you want

902
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,840
to come back for more.

903
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,840
I mean, I've heard this song a thousand times and it really sticks to your lungs.

904
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,840
I mean to your head.

905
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,840
Oh, whatever.

906
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,840
This is Dan Costello on the Daily Source Code.

907
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,840
Geez.

908
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,840
I wonder where I can get some splinter around here.

909
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,840
No, no, no, no.

910
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,840
Not for my coffee.

911
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,840
I just want to snort and see what happens.

912
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,840
I forget it.

913
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,840
Here's the song.

914
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,840
Dan Costello, the Pot song.

915
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:46,840
This is the last time I spoke about this whole cue.

916
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:51,840
Not sure how much the stuff is all I don't want up on the line.

917
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:56,840
And do it enough.

918
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:01,840
This is the last time I've screened my boat without a control.

919
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,840
I'm here and home on this waste my soul.

920
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,840
Yeah, we cover each other.

921
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:16,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

922
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:21,840

924
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:33,420

I leave for San Francisco Tuesday if all goes according to plan so Monday another show from the cottage

928
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,420
And I do really sincerely hope I can get the lady Patricia to join us

929
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:05,420
Hopefully well, of course, I hope she feels better, but if she still immobilize that you can't run it around and be doing other things

930
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:09,420
And then we can basically we can nail her down to the chair here in the studio

931
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,420
So have yourself a great weekend. I'll see you on Monday. Bye bye.
