00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,100
420 beliefs started for me

180
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,100
Oh man

181
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,100
I'm going to say about 15 years ago

182
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,100
I just did a documentary of Jamaica

183
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,100
That was actually of the Caribbean

184
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,100
But spent about 10 days in Jamaica

185
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,100
Doing a full blown documentary

186
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,100
I believe actually

187
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,100
That documentary is available now as a show

188
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,100
I'm pod show plus I'm going to go take a look

189
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,100
Because my body from Australia

190
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,100
Had digitized that so I did see it somewhere

191
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,100
It's in a very small, quick time format

192
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,100
You can see us actually

193
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,100
Cutting a record and then taking

194
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,100
The master tape to tough going records

195
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,100
And they actually press the vinyl for us

196
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,100
And I went to a

197
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,100
I went to a couple of parties

198
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,100
Checked out the sound system

199
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,100
And I kind of fell into the belief in the religion

200
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,100
If you know what I mean

201
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,100
And I still even don't understand everything about this

202
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,100
420 business

203
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,100
Hi Adam, this is Jennifer Navadate

204
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,100
And this is a comment for show 420

205
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,100
You know, if I were to talk about

206
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,100
You're from Sayo Coffee

207
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,100
And I've heard you talk about your screaves

208
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,100
What I haven't heard you talk about

209
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,100
Is the WB the weight and the weight

210
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,100
To elaborate a little bit more

211
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,100
And how that works in your life

212
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,100
Oh wait a minute

213
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,100
And have a great show 420

214
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,100
Okay, no no no now I get it

215
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,100
I even had it in my show notes

216
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,100
This is pretty funny

217
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,100
I listened to that comment

218
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,100
Just through the speakers of the

219
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
Toshiba laptop

220
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,100
Let me just I'm changing in the show notes right now

221
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,100
And I actually thought she said

222
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,100
Weight and weight

223
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,100
I don't know what that is

224
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,100
So I'll play that comment

225
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,100
But now that I hear it and I hear her saying

226
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,100
Wake and bake, yeah got it

227
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,100
Well, I'm not recommended

228
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,100
That's not a good way to start off your day

229
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,100
It really isn't but there are some days

230
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,100
You know, when it's appropriate

231
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,100
Like Saturday morning, Sunday morning

232
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,100
Coming to you from Curry Cottage

233
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,100
This is the daily source code

234
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,100
It's episode 420

235
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,100
A lot of exciting stuff going on

236
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
I feel real good about podshow

237
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
Plus and the podcast delivery network

238
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,100
Which we've now put into public beta

239
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,100
There's still there's such a world of

240
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,100
Difference between beta testing stuff

241
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,100
And and using it in a closed environment

242
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,100
Actually seeing it come alive with people

243
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,100
Digging each other

244
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,100
Getting shows, putting links in

245
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,100
Pimpin out there their pages

246
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,100
It's and and so much response

247
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,100
And I'm telling you

248
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,100
I what I'd really like

249
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,100
If even if you don't like

250
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,100
What you're seeing, please send me a comment

251
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,100
You know, booth

252
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,100
Commonster bloggers already accusing me of only playing positive

253
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,100
Positive comments about podshow

254
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,100
Plus. I'm just not getting any any criticism

255
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
Or very little criticism through audio comments

256
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
So you should definitely give us a call

257
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,100
Hold on a second, let me uh

258
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,100
Let me get the phone number for you

259
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,100
I don't know it by heart

260
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,100
Can you believe that? I still don't know the phone numbers by heart

261
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Hold on, where is it?

262
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Uh, crap

263
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,100
I'm believable

264
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Where the heck did I save it?

265
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,100
Oh dude

266
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,100
I'm so host

267
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Hold on a second, I'm messing everything up here

268
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
All of a sudden like yesterday show

269
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,100
I think I started off by saying

270
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,100
Uh three nineteen instead of four nineteen

271
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
So you can tell that I was definitely lost

272
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
Ah shit

273
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,100
Ah come on, give me the

274
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,100
Don't here we go

275
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,100
In New Jersey

276
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,100
So that would be plus one two zero one six two five six three five seven

277
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,100
Or if you prefer in London

278
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,100
Plus four four two zero seven six eight one three seven five three

279
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,100
And then we go let me just put this into the uh into your show notes there

280
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,100
Boom perfect

281
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,100
I'm loving it now I can put everything into cast blaster

282
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,100
And it all goes straight up to the

283
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,100
To the to the servers as show notes

284
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,100
It's freaking amazing. I love it. Okay. Wow. We back to today's show

285
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,100
Um

286
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
Speaking of comic strip blogger. Oh, it's doing

287
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,100
I don't where's this jingo?

288
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Yeah, I'll have to go look for the jingo here. Check them out

289
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,100
Yeah, I don't carry yes. You still are screwing your beloved blackberry

290
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Well

291
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,100
I see that you have launched the pot show

292
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,100
Plus at last I am not taking these features of pot show

293
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,100
Plus that are a clone of my space that come

294
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,100
But I like this free podcast hosting feature

295
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:44,100
How about ability to use once on the main for pot castle hosted for free on pot show

296
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,100
Plus is it coming in and time soon? Is it coming?

297
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,100
Whatever

298
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,100
We got a meet to drink some beer made. How about cash?

299
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,100
Yeah

300
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,100
A good question coming strip blogger. Yes, in fact

301
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,100
That is a major part of well first of all you can always

302
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,100
Um web forward a domain name obviously to your pot show

303
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,100
Plus domain so in your case it's csb dot pot show dot com

304
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,100
But yes, in fact we're going to be integrating that with the with the whole

305
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,100
Purchase of a domain name. Doesn't that make a lot of sense?

306
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,100
Now does the whole go daddy stuff start to come together?

307
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,100
Uh, so obviously the the concept would be you

308
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,100
Yeah, here's how it would really work if I were doing a my show

309
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
It's okay. Think up a name so it's

310
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
Um

311
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,100
The Polish podcast

312
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,100
dot com it might even be available go to go daddy dot com you get the pot

313
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,100
You get the domain name you check out using code dsc3 so you get it for $695

314
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Sanson right there would be configured to my pot show plus account wouldn't that be beautiful if that worked

315
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,100
Well, that's exactly what we're planning

316
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Hi Adam this is Slotsky. I saw a lot of the s.k. y

317
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,100
From Oxford England and just call it a say that I've been listening to the s.c.

318
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,100
Uh, about to the shows and you've been going on about the podcast with

319
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:06,100
We get what the long time have been also curious to see what it's like

320
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,100
And now that we've got it

321
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,100
I love it

322
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,100
Thank you, bye

323
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,100
No, thank you

324
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,100
Yeah, I see a lot of people confused about what what it is we're doing and yeah for hundreds of episodes

325
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,100
I've been talking about this and we've been building this for listeners and

326
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,100
We truly believe that this is what listeners

327
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,100
We will use and I'm shoot. I'm using it and I'm well

328
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Um, has audience members and listeners basically we build it for what we want

329
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:40,100
It ourselves and what we believe in is the right way and a fun way and an easy way

330
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,100
Um

331
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:48,100
To discover podcasts to share them to create them to create channels of podcasts, you know

332
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
It's uh

333
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,100
We really worked on that a lot through our own experience

334
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,100
Um, something very prolific I was going to say or was it profound?

335
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,100
I never can remember

336
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,100
Well, we'll get to it. There's more feedback. Check this one out

337
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Hi Adam, my name's Darren, long time listener and pro-crastinating podcast

338
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,100
I've only done about four shows in the last 12 months

339
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,100
But I'll get round to do another one

340
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,100
Eventually I've been having a look around pod show plus

341
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,100
And I have to say I'm a little bit confused

342
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,100
I'm trying to get um, the RSS feed for the

343
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,100
Bond show that's coming up

344
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,100
I do like the idea of a

345
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,100
Um, a quiz show on a podcast

346
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:38,100
But knowing how I am I'm unless I've got an RSS feed set up now

347
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,100
Then I'm going to forget about looking back and signing up with it

348
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,100
Other later date

349
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,100
Is there a um, a feed for it already or has the owner of the pod?

350
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,100
Cast just not put one up yet

351
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,100
Um, if you just point me in the direction of of what I'm supposed to be doing here

352
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,100
Okay, yeah, great question

353
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,100
And I've seen other people and this is what my microphone potential meter is

354
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,100
Pring it

355
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,100
This is a question I've seen come up time and time again

356
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,100
Um, people who have been enjoying pod cast

357
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,100
Um, for a while now understand the orange and white XML button

358
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,100
Love to copy that link and then put it into their favorite pod catcher

359
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,100
Which in many cases is iTunes or juice

360
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,100
Um, if you click on an episode you'll see a little box right at the top appear

361
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,100
And it'll allow you to play the episode and we know as media player or real player

362
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:34,100
Um, there's a button there to automatically subscribe yourself to that pod cast with iTunes

363
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,100
Uh, there's a XML button there so you can copy it and paste it into something else

364
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,100
It's just one click further than um, then the homepage

365
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,100
And you know, I'm I'm kind of evaluating that as well

366
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,100
Uh, I don't I don't think that's I think that box should surface or at least be optional

367
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,100
To surface on the homepage and it may actually be available

368
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,100
I just haven't figured out how the modules work

369
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:59,100
This is the big thing is we have my page and you can go and edit your profile

370
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,100
It's all drag and drop and add modules and dude

371
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,100
We need more modules and I'll talk about that in a second

372
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,100
We'll just finish up your audio comment here

373
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Um, and of course to end this voice mail

374
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,100
I'm a scruncher, but I kind of like scrunch it to get the volume

375
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,100
And then neatly wrap it around the outside to get the smooth surface against the um

376
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,100
Butx

377
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,100
I don't believe I'm saying no, I said it for you

378
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,100
Thanks for the great shirt

379
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,100
I'm like a scruncher, okay, so we have one for the UK scrunchers

380
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:34,100
And we are keeping track are you a folder of your toilet paper or are you a scruncher?

381
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,100
What else, or something else I was going to say about podshow plus is this is you know

382
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,100
When you when you build something regardless of what it is

383
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,100
If it's dependent upon other things in this case podcasting of course is

384
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,100
Very dependent upon bandwidth and the speed of delivery

385
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,100
In fact, probably still 70%

386
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,100
Actually, I think it's like you know, if 27% of all podcasts that we see in our network

387
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,100
That run through our servers are being picked up by podcatchers

388
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,100
By automatic download programs such as iTunes

389
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,100
And the rest is all direct links

390
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,100
And when you build something you want to build for the future

391
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,100
So if you build an application a program to run on a computer

392
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,100
And if you know that oh, if only we had more memory or faster processors

393
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,100
Then we could do this in this and this you're definitely going to build that in

394
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,100
Because of how quickly computer processing changes

395
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
So too with bandwidth

396
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,100
So my true belief and a lot of other people are with me on this

397
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,100
And some people may or may not be with me. I'd love to hear from you

398
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,100
But my true belief is that we will eventually

399
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,100
Maybe in five years live in a truly 100% connected world

400
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,100
And RSS is a great distribution format

401
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,100
It helps you

402
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,100
Basically syndicate your content

403
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,100
But you know the whole idea of downloading and pre-caching and having stuff

404
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,100
Ready for you when you pick up your iPod

405
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,100
Was really developed because of the limitations of

406
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,100
The current state of the network

407
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,100
And if you trace it all the way back to the conversations they

408
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,100
Why and I had about the enclosure element in RSS in 2001 actually

409
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:16,100
You'll see that it was all about the last yard and about getting it onto your device

410
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,100
So it'll be ready for you when you want to play it

411
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,100
So you wouldn't have such a crap the experience

412
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,100
Well now you know we're five years five years on

413
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,100
And we've got fiber rolling out and certainly in other parts of the world

414
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,100
There's plenty of bandwidth

415
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,100
And of course there eventually will be an iPod or an iPod like device

416
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,100
That understands well in fact the Nokia and 91 that I demoed for you

417
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Was already you know already getting there

418
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,100
You'll just be connected and you just say give me that podcast

419
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,100
And you'll click on the equivalent of a web link

420
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,100
And it'll start coming in and there'll be so much bandwidth available

421
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
So it'll come in really fast and start playing

422
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,100
So there will be no degradation in the experience of click and weight

423
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,100
Which is why this whole time-shifting part was put into place

424
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:02,100
Now of course there are still many valid reasons for downloading it to a device first

425
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,100
But I think that we'll see you know if we can actually afford it on airplanes as well

426
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,100
Ah excuse me sense it here

427
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,100
This sense say a moment

428
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,100
Brought to you by crap willow.podshow.com

429
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,100
That's right my sister called

430
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,100
And actually I called her just to say hi

431
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:31,100
She's an Italy and she said you know now you got this damn pod show thing going

432
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,100
I decided to sign up and I did my first podcast and it's fantastic

433
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,100
Now she tried to use cast blaster

434
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,100
But her microphone wasn't working on her PC

435
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,100
So she used her MP3 players internal microphone to record

436
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,100
I think she then loaded that file up into cast blaster

437
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,100
And then another pod safe song and she used one of the electronics effects

438
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
It was really cool to hear it

439
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,100
And I guess she used the you know the upload to the pod show servers

440
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,100
Because it seemed to work her podcast is at Italy.podshow.com

441
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,100
And it's fun it's a man the whole family's getting into this

442
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,100
What is going on with the curries should we be

443
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,100
We be

444
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
worried

445
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,100
Hey, Adam this is zero mother and don't care a lot

446
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,100
I'll listen to the source code

447
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,100
May not be the right voice now for this, but we're signing up for a cocktail

448
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,100
Plus get money account click down the read terms and conditions when I was signing up

449
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,100
Send me to a page I went back had a similar level of registration

450
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,100
Uh, might be good to have a little pop up window there instead

451
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,100
Just want to let you know thanks that side, but it's awesome. It's going to be a blast

452
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Keep it up

453
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,100
Look for the expanding model

454
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,100
What what was that? What do you say at the end?

455
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,100
Yeah, the last

456
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,100
Keep it up

457
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,100
Look for the expanding model

458
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,100
Well, Brad we would have flopped too

459
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,100
Fantastic

460
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,100
That's a bug. We got to fix that. Dolly noted. Thank you

461
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,100
It's seven it's no I

462
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,100
Why did I congratulate you on your launch of

463
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,100
I show plus

464
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,100
I've recently come to the conclusion that there's really two types of people

465
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:11,100
In life and there's uh, there's the ones who want and desire things

466
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,100
And and then there's the ones who go get

467
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:20,100
And with what you've done is obviously with what you've done for podcasting

468
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:26,100
And what you've done now for creating this this delicious blend of social network

469
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Combined with audcasters and podcasting

470
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,100
It's really inspiring and I just wanted to congratulate you

471
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:39,100
And being a person that to me is inspiring to really go out there and get it

472
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,100
And get something done rather than sitting on a couch

473
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,100
And saying wouldn't it be cool if you know that

474
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,100
That's just really someone I wanted to

475
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,100
So personally in the phone say thank you for what you've done

476
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,100
So have a great time. Keep up the podcasting

477
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,100
I listen all the time and talk to you soon

478
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,100
Dude, you gave me a semi. Thank you

479
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,100
Dude, speaking of that

480
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:10,100
What's this this whole thing this this bone thing going on between CC Chapman and

481
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,100
Peter

482
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:17,100
Which of course is a blatant promotion to try and get you to go and pre-register for our game show

483
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,100
Bone.podshow.com

484
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,100
And as I discussed just earlier click on an episode

485
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,100
Or from that front page you can get it you can get the podcast just click on

486
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,100
Get it if you're registered and signed in log bin

487
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:33,100
And you can get the feeds from any of the episode pages now

488
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,100
After

489
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,100
CC and PW did their little WrestleMania throw down

490
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,100
Someone else is added to the mix

491
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:47,100
Okay boys

492
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,100
I have had enough

493
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,100
I just got two more emails about you as a first

494
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,100
PW

495
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,100
CC stop it and stop it now

496
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,100
I know there's a problem on a quantity is

497
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,100
You can see that they're talking about a fight and the one and the other

498
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,100
And saying bad things about one and the other

499
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,100
Then the bone and one and the other what is that about

500
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,100
Don't beat Bowling one and the other

501
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,100
Stop it

502
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,100
I mean it

503
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,100
It just hurts me. We go fishing every summer

504
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,100
We've done it for 14 years

505
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,100
He's always get a lot as a matter of fact

506
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,100
You both can't up on me and make fun of me

507
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,100
I don't tear

508
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,100
I don't die

509
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,100
You hear me bad talking about y'all

510
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,100
No

511
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,100
Cause I love you

512
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,100
And it's love one another

513
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,100
Now you stop it

514
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,100
Now you know what I'll do

515
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,100
And don't you make me

516
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,100
Come over and take my belt off

517
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,100
Because you know what you see

518
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,100
Remember two summers ago

519
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,100
When Adam Curry was a fussing with that man

520
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,100
That they were a gas place where he gets gas for the boat

521
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,100
I took my belt off and looked here

522
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
Let me taste them

523
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,100
How we are dead

524
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,100
Stop it

525
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,100
Stop it now

526
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,100
Stop it

527
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,100
We'll see it

528
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,100
Is that Biodneasle son?

529
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,100
Boom.potshow.com

530
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,100
It's PotShow's brand new game show

531
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,100
Kicking off very soon

532
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,100
I think there's a promo up there now

533
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,100
Think you'll like it in the first round

534
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,100
The first episode of Bond

535
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,100
It's a CC Chapman

536
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,100
Throwing down against peda

537
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,100
The sad light repair man

538
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,100
And I believe that we'll also

539
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,100
Well, I'm pretty sure

540
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,100
We're going to get one of those shows on to serious stars

541
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,100
102

542
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,100
If you're listening to the daily source code there

543
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,100
This is the pod show block

544
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,100
Bringing you the best in pod casting

545
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,100
Taking up to 10 o'clock this evening

546
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,100
Pacific Coast Hellway is coming up next

547
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,100
If you want to join in the fun

548
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,100
Come on over to podshow.com

549
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,100
Or if you just want to

550
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,100
Listen to the rest of this podcast

551
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,100
Which we simply don't have time for

552
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,100
Because of the satellite medium

553
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,100
The linear way in which it operates

554
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,100
Go to daily source code.com

555
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,100
And download the rest of the show there

556
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,100
Let's see

557
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,100
What's else I was talking about

558
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,100
Oh yeah about developers

559
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,100
This is why we had developers

560
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,100
We were handing out golden tickets

561
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,100
We wanted them to come into podshow

562
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,100
I'll be done in a second with the podshow talk

563
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,100
We wanted to get them in early

564
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,100
So they could start creating these modules

565
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,100
And I'm thinking now

566
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,100
I know tons of different ideas

567
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,100
For modules that I just love to see

568
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,100
That I wanted an module

569
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,100
You know is one of these elements you can put on

570
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,100
Your on your page at podshow.com

571
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,100
And before I talk about the two that I want

572
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,100
Put your right hand in the air

573
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,100
Not take the split file

574
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,100
Okay, and wave goodbye to all our friends

575
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,100
On serious stars 102

576
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,100
PCH is next for you

577
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,100
So I'd love to have a

578
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,100
What I'm listening to right now

579
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,100
That would be so cool

580
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,100
If you could go to my page

581
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,100
You could see what show I was listening to at that

582
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,100
Very moment that could be a module

583
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,100
Or something else I thought of

584
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,100
If I'm if I'm listening to a show

585
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,100
And I want to you know put a message about that

586
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,100
I want to promote it on my page

587
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,100
I'd love to have some kind of module for that as well

588
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,100
You know where you click something

589
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,100
And then you can type in a little bit of text

590
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,100
And then it goes straight into a predesignated spot

591
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,100
But there's just tons of things we can come up with

592
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,100
And apparently it's fairly simple

593
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,100
If you go to developer.podshow.com

594
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,100
There's an SDK available

595
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,100
Excuse me

596
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,100
This and say a moment

597
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,100
Brought to you by bone

598
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,100
The new game show from podshow

599
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,100
Bone.podshow.com

600
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,100
And then finally

601
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,100
And this is something that's

602
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,100
That has just been kind of

603
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,100
Slipping through the cracks

604
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
If you've created a channel

605
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,100
Which means when you get a podcast

606
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,100
You can select a place to put it

607
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,100
A channel as what we call it

608
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,100
On the left hand side

609
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,100
I'm just going to go to my collection right now

610
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,100
So I can represent it properly

611
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,100
On the left hand side of

612
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,100
Each channel on the

613
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,100
There's a little bar there that has the channel name

614
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,100
There's a little white down arrow

615
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,100
And it's clearly it's not obvious enough

616
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,100
But if you click that it expands the entire channel

617
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,100
And gives you a whole bunch of different options

618
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,100
Just like when clicking on an episode of the podcast

619
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,100
From there

620
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,100
You can subscribe to it in iTunes

621
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,100
You can actually manage it

622
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,100
Put it into other channels

623
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,100
But you can also hit the play channel button

624
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,100
Now when you hit the play channel button

625
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,100
Guess what?

626
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,100
Exactly

627
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,100
It plays all of the podcast in that channel

628
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,100
With the most recent one being first

629
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,100
Back to back in the dashboard

630
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,100
And of course you can do the same

631
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,100
With Windows Media Player

632
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,100
Of course it's not going to download

633
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,100
Play all of those podcasts as fast as they can come

634
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,100
Barely into you

635
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,100
So that's something you might want to check out

636
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,100
It's a R.A. Potshoe plus tip of the day

637
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,100
So I told you my sister called me and she told me about her podcast

638
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,100
And about her page on Potshoe

639
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,100
And then she said by the way

640
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,100
Just so you know

641
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,100
I'm a scruncher

642
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,100
Hey Adam

643
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,100
This is Shui from

644
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,100
It was a telephone amp

645
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,100
I wanted to tell you about the youngsters

646
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,100
I am a scruncher

647
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,100
I take three or four

648
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,100
I don't know the blue

649
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,100
Kind of squares that are preferring

650
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,100
I take off their scrunches

651
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,100
Gather and light my ass

652
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,100
And make sure I'm squeaky clean

653
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,100
Yeah

654
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,100
That also might be the fact

655
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,100
That I'm an unruly teenager

656
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,100
I don't know

657
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,100
Yep

658
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,100
Just calling it to let you know that I'm a scruncher

659
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,100
Thanks

660
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,100
Thank you

661
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,100
That's good information

662
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,100
So we've got two American scrunchers now

663
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,100
And we've got one European scruncher

664
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,100
Where are the folders?

665
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,100
I'm Chris from Nashville

666
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,100
Just been listening to your

667
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,100
D.S.C.

668
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,100
The gang spurs is the Brits

669
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,100
Yeah, I'm a scruncher

670
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,100
I just want to let you know

671
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,100
That's such an intimate detail to fill me in on

672
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,100
But I'm so appreciative of it

673
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,100
And Leo Vagoda sent me a fantastic link

674
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,100
And this is of course this is truly what we needed

675
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,100
There is a website and I'll put a link into the show notes

676
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,100
Of course

677
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,100
Scruncher or folder.com

678
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,100
And we're tallying it up

679
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,100
Who's a folder?

680
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,100
Who's a scruncher?

681
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:28,100
Go to scroo to scruncher.no scruncher or folder.com

682
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:33,100
How do a couple of the

683
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,100
extraneous things here?

684
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,100
Oh yeah, once I've been using Google

685
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,100
Reader for probably half a year

686
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,100
Now at least that imported my

687
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,100
My opml subscription list into it a long time ago

688
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,100
And they went through a lot of interface

689
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,100
Crap

690
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,100
But they've changed a lot of stuff now

691
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,100
And now you don't have to dig down 15 levels

692
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,100
To actually add a subscription

693
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,100
Or to manage them or to delete them

694
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,100
And you can easily find all postings within one subscription

695
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,100
And it's got a lot of really good Ajax stuff

696
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,100
So even your scroll wheel works in the scroll

697
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,100
In the scroll area of the stories

698
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,100
And it's kind of like a river of news concept

699
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,100
So you know, and it has some kind of relevancy

700
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,100
Magic behind it

701
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,100
I'm really enjoying it

702
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,100
It is definitely getting me the stuff that I'm

703
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,100
Most interested in reading

704
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,100
I do want to mention that

705
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,100
And yes, I got a call from our sales department

706
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,100
From Greg

707
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,100
The Sales Weasel

708
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,100
And he said, yeah, man

709
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,100
We've got this promotion running for a little man

710
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,100
The movie and actually I'm going to go take a look at

711
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,100
Let me go look at a little man right now

712
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,100
And he says they have a podcast

713
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,100
Hold on

714
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,100
Littlemanpodcast.com

715
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,100
Let me just go there

716
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,100
I think something actually plays when you hit the page

717
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,100
Let me see

718
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,100
I remember

719
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,100
Yeah, what is it?

720
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,100
Oh, it's the way in brothers

721
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,100
Marlin Wayne, Sean Wands

722
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,100
And it's a new movie called Littleman

723
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,100
And it starts on

724
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,100
It's in theaters July 14th

725
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,100
And so they have this podcast

726
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,100
Let's just see, well here's the show

727
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,100
This is the trailer, I think

728
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,100
The trailer of the movie

729
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,100
Let's watch it together, shall we?

730
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,100
I'll see what he has that

731
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,100
Let's see, maybe the audience will be good

732
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,100
The audio will be good enough for you

733
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,100
In the world of crime

734
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,100
There is no one

735
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,100
Where lesbians, where comfortable shoe

736
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,100
Spopee

737
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,100
You've got to put on the card

738
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,100
And you'll bout to get one in your butt

739
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,100
Sorry, cow

740
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,100
Now he's back in action

741
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,100
And going for the score of a lifetime

742
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,100
That's what I'm talking about

743
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,100
But something is about to go

744
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,100
The queen's diamond is gone

745
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,100
Terribly

746
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,100
And to finish the job

747
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,100
This is very silly

748
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,100
The digital

749
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,100
Now what?

750
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,100
We go get it

751
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,100
They got silly

752
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,100
You'll have to, I like the music

753
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,100
I've got a plan, yo

754
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,100
You're good

755
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,100
In someone else's crib

756
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,100
Honey

757
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,100
Look, I'm like God

758
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
It's a big thing

759
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,100
Go, go, go, go

760
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,100
From director, King and Ivory Wands

761
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,100
You know what?

762
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,100
This is so silly

763
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,100
I bet you this is going to be the summer blockbuster

764
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,100
The National Geographic sort of way

765
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,100
The guys who brought you white chicks

766
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,100
Another fine movie

767
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
Have a good night's sleep

768
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,100
Creamy

769
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,100
Oh, it's buttermilk

770
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,100
Yeah, right

771
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,100
There's a special bundle of joy

772
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,100
I'm going to show you how great it is to have a day

773
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,100
I'm you're going to show me what it's like to be a day

774
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,100
Okay

775
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,100
So anyway, so they want me to talk about the

776
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,100
Talk about the movie

777
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,100
And I said I can't talk about the movie

778
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,100
Because I haven't seen the movie

779
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,100
And I can't recommend the movie

780
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,100
If I haven't seen it

781
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,100
So they're going to try and get me a copy of it

782
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,100
As soon as possible

783
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:49,100
Probably one of those that like sent to the Academy of

784
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,100
Motion pictures, arts and sciences

785
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,100
So you can vote on it

786
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,100
Some hide doubt this is going to win in the Academy Award

787
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,100
Oh, by seeing

788
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,100
Buying

789
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,100
Oh, yeah

790
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,100
Come way in

791
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,100
Who were me

792
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,100
You were an animal last night

793
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,100
You've never done that before

794
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,100
The little guy

795
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,100
Little man

796
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,100
Okay

797
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,100
You know what? On a day like today

798
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,100
When it's episode 420

799
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,100
Yeah, I think that would be the perfect movie

800
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,100
To go and see

801
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,100
Alright, littlemanpodcast.com

802
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,100
And show

803
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,100
As soon as I've seen the movie

804
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,100
I'll let you know

805
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,100
Uh, see what else we're going to talk about

806
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,100
Rocket Boob

807
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,100
Yeah, that's next

808
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,100
New host for the Rocket Boomb podcast

809
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,100
Yeah, play the intensity

810
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,100
Listen, I was just listening to your comments about Rocket Boomb

811
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,100
And uh, you know what?

812
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,100
It's supposed to happen in Rocket Boomb

813
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,100
I think it's going to go down

814
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,100
Uh, I mean an X

815
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,100
MTV DJ

816
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,100
He's doing a podcast

817
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,100
Come on

818
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,100
No way that can work

819
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,100
Anyway, give up a good work

820
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,100
Fuck you soon

821
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,100
I agree

822
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,100
XMTVVJ's doing podcast

823
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,100
We'll never fly

824
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,100
It's a stupid idea

825
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,100
It just can't happen

826
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,100
Yeah, show was good

827
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,100
You know, she's she's the interim host

828
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,100
Is now what she's being built as

829
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,100
She's a co-owner named Joanne

830
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,100
I've never seen her on an MTV

831
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,100
Hold on a second

832
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,100
Let me just go to Rocket Boomb.com

833
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,100
That's the great name

834
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,100
Rocket Boomb three syllables

835
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,100
Always good

836
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,100
What's her name again?

837
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,100
Joanne Colon

838
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,100
Colon

839
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,100
How does she say?

840
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,100
Does she say Colon or Colon?

841
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,100
Uh, who cares?

842
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,100
Uh, she's cute

843
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,100
She's good

844
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,100
You know, she's professional

845
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,100
Uh, this is, you know, MTV

846
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,100
People who work at MTV

847
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,100
Or have worked at MTV

848
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,100
The MTV truly is

849
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,100
The purest form of gorilla television

850
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,100
The budgets are so incredibly low

851
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,100
It's not the MTV video musical words of course

852
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,100
But, you know, this is the segments

853
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,100
You know, these are taped in sequence

854
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,100
One after another

855
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,100
The videos are inserted later

856
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,100
So you're kind of pretending that you just saw the video

857
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,100
Some of the live shows, of course, is different

858
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,100
Obviously

859
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,100
Um, so there's a lot of pretending that you just saw something

860
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,100
The vibe is really what you create

861
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,100
On the studio floor itself

862
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,100
Because it's pretty dead stuff to do

863
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,100
Um, and particularly stuff on the road

864
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,100
You know, you know, the whole

865
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,100
What we used to call the wookie cam

866
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,100
It's like the tilting left

867
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,100
And then tilting right

868
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,100
And then moving in and moving back

869
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,100
That was developed because

870
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,100
MTV couldn't afford

871
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,100
Or wouldn't provide steady cams

872
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,100
And so it's, it's much easier

873
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,100
Um, you know, what we say

874
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,100
In the, in the music business

875
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,100
Actually, if you can't cover it up

876
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,100
Turn it up

877
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,100
So, you know, it's very hard to keep a steady shot

878
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,100
Um, when someone's doing a stand-up

879
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,100
Somewhere on location

880
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,100
Um, and that's why steady cams are so beautiful

881
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,100
And particularly the type of locations

882
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,100
MTV goes to the lot of shaking going on

883
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,100
Um, so camera men just started doing this thing

884
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,100
You know, the in and out zoom

885
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,100
And the left and right tilt

886
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,100
I have a feeling that maybe it was Warren

887
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,100
Who was one of our camera men

888
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,100
He may have started that in the studio

889
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,100
I'm not too sure

890
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,100
I think I, I think member Warren doing it first

891
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,100
And then all the freelance guys got into it

892
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,100
Because it also made it much easier for them

893
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,100
You know, hey man, why should I have to have a really steady hand

894
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,100
When I can do all this wookie cam stuff

895
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,100
Same with the jump cut

896
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,100
Um, MTV, you know, I think that they either didn't have the equipment

897
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,100
To make great transitions

898
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,100
Um, and probably didn't have the, I got a sneeze

899
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,100
Hold on

900
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,100
Ah, excuse me

901
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,100
Ah, I was looking at the light

902
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,100
And I heard you saying bless you

903
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,100
Don't do that when someone asked the sneeze

904
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,100
Oh, I'm sorry

905
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,100
That was, perhaps disgusting

906
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,100
I mean it that way

907
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,100
The jump cut

908
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,100
Um, developed an MTV, you know, just lack of knowledge

909
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,100
And lack of tools I think

910
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,100
And it turned into an art form

911
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,100
And people said all sudden like, well, that jump cut thing

912
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,100
We were taught in film school that we weren't supposed to do

913
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,100
It actually, well, it actually turns out

914
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,100
It's pretty cool

915
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,100
Um, it's anyway back to Joanne Colon

916
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,100
Colon, Colon just doesn't sound right

917
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,100
Um, she's a great job

918
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,100
And, but I think kind of the appeal

919
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,100
The, the underground

920
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,100
Um, non-professionalism of a man

921
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,100
I think that team, you know, that

922
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:11,100
To me was more appealing than any, any other part of her, or her, her appearance

923
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,100
Although that's nice too

924
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,100
Um, but, you know, it was a combination of things

925
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,100
Combination

926
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,100
So, we'll see, we'll see where it goes

927
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,100
So far so good, I would say

928
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,100
And, you know, I'm really waiting to see when a man is going to do

929
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,100
She can totally, um, go on to do great things

930
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,100
Uh, I do think she should start going

931
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,100
Because I do know that

932
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,100
It's all about the timing

933
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,100
And it's all about the talent

934
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,100
And the right talent put together

935
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,100
You've got to have the right team

936
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,100
And you've got to tiger your way through

937
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,100
Uh, and I think that the news is getting old

938
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,100
And she better start capitalizing on it pretty quickly

939
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,100
Uh, then just briefly something that, uh,

940
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,100
A number of people sent to me

941
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,100
Uh, it's a BBC story

942
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,100
And of course, I will link to that in the show notes

943
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,100
Opening it up right now

944
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,100
The, uh, UK's independent music labels

945
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,100
Now want to charge

946
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,100
Um, so they want, they want the law changed

947
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,100
So internet service providers become liable

948
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,100
For illegal file sharing by their users

949
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,100
This is the association of independent music

950
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,100
Uh, and they've outlined an entire plan

951
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,100
Um, about copyright reform

952
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,100
And they call this actually an innovative answer

953
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,100
An innovative answer

954
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,100
So the whole idea is

955
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,100
They want the your internet service provider

956
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,100
To pay them a licensing fee

957
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,100
And somehow apparently track what we're sharing

958
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,100
Even if it's illegal and to have them pay for it

959
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,100
It's a stupid

960
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,100
That's fucking stupid

961
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,100
Jesus Christ, you're open

962
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,100
It'll never happen first of all

963
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,100
We are opening yourself up

964
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,100
Because the law clearly states that they're, uh,

965
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,100
Conduit, you know, they're just a pass through provider

966
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,100
There's not their responsibility

967
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,100
But, you know, you do this

968
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,100
And you actually push that law through somehow

969
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,100
And in the UK it appears that you can pretty much, you know,

970
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,100
Buy your seat in government these days

971
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,100
Just by providing a loan to one of the parties

972
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,100
Um, you want to push that through

973
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,100
I mean, then everyone who has any type of copyright

974
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,100
Is going to turn right to the ISPs

975
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,100
And you'll shut it down

976
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:12,100
This is worse than any so-called net neutrality

977
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,100
Debacle, uh,

978
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,100
A annihilation of the internet

979
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,100
This will totally bring it down

980
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,100
And it's stupid

981
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,100
And the things that I'm reading in this article

982
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,100
He had the innovative answer

983
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,100
Uh, let me just find some of these quotes here

984
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,100
Just really bug me

985
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,100
Mmm

986
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:35,100
David Ferguson, chairman of the British Academy of Composers

987
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,100
And songwriters said quote

988
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,100
Professional composers and songwriters

989
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,100
Are only able to produce new music

990
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,100
If they are paid for their work

991
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,100
That's such bullshit

992
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,100
Cry-key

993
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,100
That is, you, all of a sudden you take a whole group of people

994
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,100
Who are just as talented

995
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:54,100
But certainly no more talented than podcasters for instance

996
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,100
Who also create a product

997
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,100
In fact, we create a lot more product

998
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,100
And saying, you know, if you don't get paid

999
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,100
Then you can't, you can't make your art

1000
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,100
And it's bull crap

1001
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,100
You know it is

1002
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,100
Oh, it's so, uh,

1003
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,100
Ignorant

1004
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,100
Ignorant

1005
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,100
You know, even from a technological standpoint

1006
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,100
There's no way to document it

1007
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,100
And police it

1008
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,100
And, uh, but to say, you know, this is an innovative answer

1009
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,100
To the problem

1010
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:24,100
And these, and this is the independent music labels

1011
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,100
Please

1012
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,100
Get a grip on reality

1013
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,100
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1014
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:33,100
Ah, then one final thing for today

1015
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,100
This is really nice

1016
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,100
A Nielsen study came out

1017
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,100
Which is, I have a PDF of it here

1018
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,100
Podcasting gains an important foothold amongst

1019
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,100
U.S. adult online population

1020
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,100
Now Nielsen are the guys that, uh,

1021
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,100
That really are the benchmark for billions of

1022
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,100
Dollars worth of advertising money

1023
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,100
Around the globe

1024
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,100
So, uh, I'll just read the first paragraph here

1025
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,100
Nielsen that ratings a global leader

1026
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,100
And internet media and market research

1027
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,100
By the way, owned by VNU, a Dutch company

1028
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:09,100
An ounce today, and this is nice, that 6.6% of the U.S. adult online population

1029
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,100
Or 9.2 million web users

1030
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,100
Have recently downloaded an audio podcast

1031
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,100
4% or 5.6 million web users

1032
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,100
Have recently downloaded a video podcast

1033
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,100
And then they have a whole table here

1034
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,100
And they've got all kinds of breakout stats

1035
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:27,100
Uh, these figures put the podcasting population on par

1036
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,100
With those who publish blogs

1037
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,100
Uh, 4.8% and online data is 3.9%

1038
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,100
Interesting

1039
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,100
How we're podcasting is not yet nearly as popular

1040
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,100
As viewing and paying bills online

1041
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,100
Which is, uh, one of the most popular activities on the internet

1042
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:45,100
51.6% online job hunting 24.6%

1043
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,100
So, they go through, um, they go through a lot of stuff here

1044
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,100
And, uh, there's already, uh, people are picking up

1045
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,100
Some of the statistics and saying, well, it turns out that

1046
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,100
People who listen to audio podcasts

1047
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,100
Most of them use Safari

1048
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,100
Uh, as the number one browser

1049
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,100
That would automatically make a lot of audio listeners

1050
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,100
Mac users

1051
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,100
That's interesting

1052
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:09,100
But I'd like to know where they got their data from

1053
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,100
Uh, number two is Firefox

1054
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:15,100
And, uh, really trailing way behind is, uh, internet explorer

1055
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,100
Now for video podcasts

1056
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,100
Um, the numbers even a little bit higher

1057
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,100
But still the same ranking Safari Firefox internet explorer

1058
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,100
I really, I should figure out where they

1059
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,100
Where they got their data from

1060
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,100
Um, okay, and then they, you know, then they say, you know, here

1061
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,100
The sites that these people go to

1062
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,100
And, uh, and that's pretty funny here

1063
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:41,100
It is, um, here, top content and e-commerce sites

1064
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,100
Visited by podcasters

1065
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,100
This is the US home and work

1066
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:51,100
Um, people who listen to, well, it says audio podcasters

1067
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,100
Hmm

1068
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,100
Oh, this is podcasters, okay

1069
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,100
Well, this, I think that's what they're saying

1070
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,100
So if I understand the verb, it's correctly

1071
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,100
The top content and e-commerce sites

1072
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,100
Visited by podcasters

1073
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,100
That means people who create podcasters

1074
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,100
Uh, on the audio side

1075
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,100
Their top site is Mac world

1076
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,100
Then it's a wired news slash dot

1077
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,100
Multiple e-commerce sites

1078
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,100
Niketown.com

1079
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,100
Apple and iTunes

1080
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,100
And video podcasters

1081
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,100
This is the astounding number

1082
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,100
Video podcasters

1083
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,100
All seem to go to startrek.com

1084
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,100
Follow by live thricks365.com

1085
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,100
That makes a lot of sense

1086
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,100
Because, uh, that's a streaming

1087
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,100
Uh, a streaming content provider

1088
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,100
Fark.com, because of course, a lot of these

1089
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,100
Video podcasters, humorous and cynical

1090
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:48,100
And, uh, and based on the topical

1091
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,100
News of the day

1092
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,100
Then the e-commerce sites e-music

1093
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,100
And also Niketown.com

1094
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,100
What the hell is going on at Niketown

1095
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,100
Won't you take me to Niketown

1096
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,100
Let's see, what the hell is it

1097
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,100
Why is Niketown so popular

1098
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,100
Oh, on Niketown.com

1099
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,100
Oh, this is going to be something really good here

1100
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,100
What the hell happens at Niketown

1101
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,100
Oh, you know what?

1102
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,100
So you hit Niketown and there you see

1103
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,100
I think this data is bogus

1104
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,100
I don't know

1105
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,100
Oh, I sound a Canadian there, didn't I?

1106
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:23,100
So that's the iPod that connects to your shoes

1107
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,100
I don't know, man

1108
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,100
They're me, you know, when you put it all together

1109
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,100
And you see that it's

1110
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,100
Mac people going to

1111
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:36,100
Macworld.com using the Safari browser

1112
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,100
And going to Niketown

1113
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:43,100
But it does appear from the data provided

1114
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:47,100
It does appear that Mac people

1115
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:51,100
seem to be doing more podcasting than windows people

1116
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,100
Which I really like as a statistic

1117
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,100
And you know why?

1118
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,100
Exactly

1119
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:02,100
Because that means when the windows people catch on

1120
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,100
Those numbers are really good

1121
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,100
Super hot, late com

1122
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,100
One more song for today

1123
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:14,100
Some about it, you know, sexism reverse

1124
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:19,100
Let me say yeah, perfect Charlie material

1125
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:23,100
Oh, it's a super hot, late com

From the podcast using that work on your daily source

1127
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,100
Don't want to take it

1128
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,100
I can't pay the fine

1129
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,100
Don't want to go to coma

1130
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:36,100
I ain't got the time

1131
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:39,100

Out of my mind

1134
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:58,100
Won't you stop writing that ticket

1135
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,100
Won't this hundred?

1136
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,100
Help you change your mind

1137
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,100
What to do with them now?

1138
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,100
Handcuffs, you're pretty late

1139
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:11,100
I thought that you and me could reach a compromise

1140
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,100
Super hot, late com

1141
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,100

You can't pay the fine

00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,100
So you got my license

1147
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,100
And I'm a registration

1148
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,100
So you got me going

1149
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,100
Close to 69

1150
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,100
That might be illegal

1151
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,100
And for the seventh day

1152
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,100
I can't help myself

1153
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,100

You can't pay the fine

1175
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,100
She had a nice set of guns

1176
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,100
30,80 least

1177
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,100
And as we talked

1178
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:49,100
I got into trouble when I tried to steal my piece

1179
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,100
See how I was sticking to myself if I

1180
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,100
I played my car grind

1181
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,100
I hope you get sprung

1182
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,100
By the end of the night

1183
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:20,100
I worked my way out of this situation

1184
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:24,100
And now I'm thinking I shouldn't pay the fine

1185
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,100
As a stepped in the van

1186
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,100
I heard a telepartner

1187
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,100
If the party wagons rocking

1188
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,100
