22

23
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,960
Hello, Curie.

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,960
Thank you for being a friend.

25
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,960
Travel down a road and back again.

26
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,960
Your heart is true.

27
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,960
You're a pal and a confidence.

28
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,960
I'm not ashamed to see.

29
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,960
I hope it always was day to sway.

30
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,960
My head is off.

31
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:19,960
We'll just stand up and take a bow.

32
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:27,960
And if you're through a party invited everyone you knew,

33
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,960
you wouldn't see the biggest gift would be for me.

34
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,960
And the card attached would say thank you for being a friend.

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,960

36
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,960

Thank you for being a friend.

38
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,960
If it's a car you lack,

39
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,960
I'd surely buy you a catalog.

40
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:15,960
Whatever you need in a time of the day or night.

41
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,960
I'm not ashamed to say.

42
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,960
I hope it always was day to sway.

43
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,960
My head is off.

44
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,960
We'll just stand up and take a bow.

45
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,960
And when we broke it all out,

46
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,960
with walking keys and hair away,

47
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,960
I've got fear even though it's hard to hear.

48
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,960
I will stand with those and save.

49
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,960
Thank you for being a friend.

50
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,960

Might as well start to show off with it.

87
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,960
With the thanks.

88
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,960
Thank you for making 500 episodes possible.

89
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,920
500 episodes possible without doubt it would be nowhere near that amount everybody how you

90
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,880
doing this is daily source code Delta Sierra Charlie episode 500 coming to you from the

91
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,320
Curry condo in a very misty northern California San Francisco to be exact good to have

92
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,720
you all long for for this 500th episode I haven't done a tremendous amount of preparation

93
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,560
I don't think I really ever do a lot of preparation for you know those round numbers

94
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,880
We've had some interesting ones episode 200 of course was at

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Nome decks in Seattle that was just coincidence. I could have actually done episode 500 yesterday

96
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,760
Or I'm sorry the day before I'm messed up already. It is now Monday. It's very early in the morning

97
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:08,120
As you know, I'm on my San Francisco schedule, which is a healthy 5 a.m. wake-up call and a diet of caffeine, aspirin, and maroine

98
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,680
And I'm feeling just fine. It was Saturday with the podcast con UK

99
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,960
About 180 200 people in in London

100
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,760
got together and

101
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:26,520
Had a an independently organized conference regarding podcasting a lot of the I would say almost typical discussions

102
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,200
Conversations which regardless of outcome if any

103
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,960
It's always good for people to get together and get those neurotransmitters

104
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,800
Bob and off each other

105
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,680
Anyway, so I could have done episode 500 there, but I definitely didn't feel that was that was appropriate

106
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,920
So so first time from from San Francisco

107
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:52,840
For the for the next 500 and really and I said this at podcast con UK is I was asked to introduce the shakes

108
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,200
Who perform live fantastic fantastic performance

109
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,080
Everything fucked up everything went wrong, but because they were just so funny about it

110
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,000
It really really worked and of course once things were cranked and they were slamming

111
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,720
And I actually said that I realized that those 500 episodes the majority of those certainly not all

112
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,040
But the majority have been created in the United Kingdom and I thanked everybody there who would

113
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:21,640
Sent in comments intros openings pod safe music and and as I was sitting down watching the shakes

114
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,640
I'm thinking fuck I forgot to say something else

115
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,280
There was one other thing I wanted to say particularly to that audience is I wanted to thank everyone there

116
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,680
For making myself and my family feeling so welcome in the United Kingdom

117
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,080
There's been every single time we had a question or or you know a yanks versus the Brits moment or just something like whoa

118
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,080
What the hell is going on here?

119
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:48,520
The it was literally yes listeners, but a lot of the podcast community in the UK who chimed in sent me audio comments and have helped us

120
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:56,040
Learn more about the country we live in which we're enjoying to the extreme amount I have to say

121
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,200
Um

122
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,560
So of course if you want to know about podcast con UK all you have to do is just to troll the voicemail lines and there's our trusty

123
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Yeah buddy Paul Nichols

124
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,560
Adam heights for Nichols here

125
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,600
Just driving home after the podcast conference and

126
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:20,120
I've just got so many things buzzing around my head up just to adjust the program and it was a couple of podcasts

127
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,960
The bands were fantastic the guys on the panel were fantastic

128
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,280
Thanks for coming thanks ever such a lot of again for helping to sponsor the

129
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,920
The podcast conference it really was a great success and I'm really looking forward to the next year

130
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,520
And what a great was and you don't see me chatman just

131
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
Such a good like

132
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,440
One great photographer is why we chat just like a side

133
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
Well lovely like

134
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,520
See you soon mate, but it's indeed a lovely blow. Yeah, we had a good time and afterwards we all went to the pub and hung out

135
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,720
I think it's a longer time of actually hung out in a pub and I enjoyed it very much

136
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,160
Particularly because I was able to have a a true traditional bitter

137
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,160
And not shows. Oh, man, that's a young spritz thing right there

138
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:15,880
So as Andrew Gold's said at the opening of the show, thank every single one of you for being a friend. It is truly appreciated

139
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,520
Independently produced audio entertainment audio entertainment

140
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,400
The internet is not something that you just dump something on it. All right, you just drag them

141
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Curious I love the run is

142
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Who cares if you're stumbling above

143
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,240
Oh, yeah, there's more where that came from coming to you from courty cottage

144
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,680
We caught it we caught it courty cottage

145
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,200
Wow, that was awesome. This is the daily source code everybody how you doing

146
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,400
Episode 500 love it with all the stuff you guys are putting together as fantastic

147
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,200
Even the

148
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,400
Even the artwork for today's show is extremely appropriate

149
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,040
I think if I say anything I need to talk about that happened over the week and of course some day morning

150
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,040
I left bright and early

151
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,680
Virgin Vs 19 to San Francisco

152
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,000
You know same old the same flight same chair actually I always get 12k

153
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,040
I love sitting on the right-hand side of the aircraft for some reason

154
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,000
Wasn't very full the flight and I wasn't at all that tired so it just you know

155
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,960
I still maybe an hour or so so by the time I went to bed last night around

156
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,000
Oh man, it was like a 10 30 or something like that

157
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,920
PST time I was tired. I was pretty ripped

158
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,280
I saw the queen movie the queen on

159
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,160
On the in flight entertainment system which truly is a fantastic

160
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,520
Selection date refresh it every single month at the beginning of the month

161
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,520
I was a pretty fun movie learn a little bit about about the monarchy and I think now I understand

162
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,720
Of course not having gone through the

163
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,800
Gone through the events of princess Diana's death in the UK. I can understand now where a lot of this hatred

164
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Towards the royal family is coming from

165
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,480
Just very interesting and another great great history lesson

166
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,480
So even though we've got

167
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,400
Oh man, I have so much stuff to play

168
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,200
It's gonna be probably a little bit longer show today and again

169
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,840
I didn't produce or prepare anything. I just basically collected all the stuff you guys was sending in

170
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,440
I'm just talking all the bits uh putting them all together. However

171
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,400
There was something that I'd asked Andrew Grummet to do

172
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,200
Well actually he came up with it himself

173
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:35,400
Remember we had this problem with juice which is the pod catcher formerly known as lemon iPod or lemon

174
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,960
um

175
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,640
With the new uh with the pod show plus upgrade version 2.0

176
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,200
A lot of users of juice all of a sudden found themselves downloading

177
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,440
a whole bunch of pod show

178
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,680
Podcasts again

179
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,320
Which of course is not desired behavior and

180
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,600
Well now we're fortunate enough to have Andrew Grummet

181
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,600
One of the lead developers on both those prod well on iPod or lemon iPod or iPod or lemon and juice

182
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,320
To be working with us here at pod show and

183
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,080
And so I said you do what happened there how do how do we do that and and you said you know what?

184
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,840
I'm gonna dress this and I'm gonna do a DSC style with an audio comment

185
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,480
plus one two

186
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Is this thing on oh

187
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,320
Hi there Adam. No hold on a second Andrew

188
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,640
Man why are you uh why are you in mono? How is that?

189
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,120
Ah

190
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,720
So of course, I don't have my uh the right mixing board here

191
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,360
I the hell is that a mono?

192
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
Oh that sucks so bad

193
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
um

194
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,880
I have no way to fix that right now

195
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,080
Shit

196
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,080
You know what it's so good

197
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,800
Oh I feel horrible now all I was like I have this uh this different mixer here

198
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,560
Uh at the at the condo. I don't think I can make it into a stereo fuck I just listen in mono

199
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,560
Andrew Grummet here um

200
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,880
I uh I'm sending you this comment to respond to Paul Smith's question about

201
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,000
Pod show shows read downloading in his juice receiver

202
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,720
Well uh I'll have to take the heat for this one and I'll explain why

203
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,280
Have to warn you though. I had to dig around in the juice code quite a bit to get the sensor and it's gonna be a serious

204
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,240
10-foil hat moment so oh hold on a second hold on a second if it's a 10-foil

205
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Oh

206
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:58,680
Pod casts are syndicated through RSS as many of you know RSS of course really simple syndication feeds

207
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:06,600
And just about all software programs that read RSS have a basic decision to make as they examine the contents of the feed

208
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,200
Have I seen this item before if I haven't it's time to download the pod cast

209
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,040
If I have seen the item before no further action is needed

210
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,520
So in the early days of pod casting we use the media URL

211
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,120
HTTP colon something something something slash podcast.mp3

212
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,200
We use that URL to determine if an item had been seen for

213
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,240
As pod casting evolved and people started changing hosts and domain names

214
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:44,680
We switched to using the RSS gooid element which if preserved when the pod cast changed domains would still be seen by the pod cast receiver as

215
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,680
quote unquote the same item and

216
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,920
That way a person could move their their pod cast from one place to another without causing redown loads

217
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:01,000
So once we had a good support to juice if you came clear that we could support even more obscure edge cases

218
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:07,880
We had a handful of people who at some point wanted to start reusing the same media URL

219
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,800
Something like you know food.com slash latest.mp3

220
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,960
I wanted to use that same URL over and over again for their pod cast

221
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,040
So in the old days juice would simply download the first version of that file and seeing that the URL

222
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,480
Was the same

223
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,080
Would stop there and then and none of the further pod cast would be downloaded

224
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,160
But if the pod cast changed their good each time that was enough to tell juice to read download

225
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,480
Even though the same URL was used

226
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
Okay, so coming back to pod show plus

227
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,480
When we launched v1 back in July we forgot to put in the gooid element

228
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,680
We finally added that element just before the v2 launch. Oh, sorry just after the v2 launch

229
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,320
So what happened was that juice saw the change in the gooid it changed of course from nothing to something

230
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,960
It saw that as a directive to read download even though it had seen the URLs before

231
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,840
So bottom line atoms right something did change in the feed

232
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:15,560
There is a much we can do it easily at this point since for most of folks the the you know download

233
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,440
Saturation is now in the past and in any case the problem will have cleared itself

234
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,080
After the read download so if you managed to catch things on time

235
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,160
Just go through your subscriptions and mark any pod cast episodes that you've already seen before as skipped

236
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:37,240
You can do this and juice by using the down arrow in the space bar quickly alternating

237
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,520
After clicking in the episodes area for the pod cast

238
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,240
So in some my apologies to folks for the bandwidth squeeze

239
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,240
You may now return to your regular porn downloading schedule

240
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,120
Yo

241
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,800
I was thinking of all kinds of appropriate punishments for Andrew

242
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:03,240
for doing that and I was thinking maybe we should make him suck a gallon of beer through a straw kind of

243
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,640
Emulate that bandwidth issue everyone's had

244
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,680
But now I just think and hey man if you just make your shit and stereo that'll be good enough

245
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:32,440
Hey there Adam Howard Greenstein here and I just wanted to wish you congratulations on your 500th episode of the Charlie

246
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,240
Usually I'm one to send you funny bits like I did for DSC 400, but you know this weekend

247
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,920
I had to spend some quality time with the family and it really was wonderful to be able to do that

248
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:49,000
So it didn't happen enough of time to create something really amazing, but stay tuned to have something in the works

249
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,720
And it will be a lot of fun and we'll show up as the intro to a Charlie in the very near future

250
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,720
I hope so

251
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,120
For me and my family to you and yours

252
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,120
Happy Thanksgiving

253
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,520
Congratulations on the new place and congratulations on 500 shows and

254
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:12,280
When you get a chance add me to your playlist. It's a chat and a song over there at Pod Show and

255
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,000
You know, it's just a small thing. I do for my friends a little chat and a song

256
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,240
Perfect podcast anyway Adam congratulations on 500 and take care

257
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,240
All right, I would thank you very much buddy

258
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:28,280
Thank thanks to all of you for calling in and leaving all these nice messages on our phone lines

259
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,080
Of course, we have two of them one in the U.S. and one in the U.K. and

260
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,520
Don't forget you need to put a plus before each number if you're dialing it from your cell phone

261
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,200
I've figured out that I can't play those to the the U.S. and the U.K. voicemails

262
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,000
After each other because whichever one is last is the one that sticks in your head and so we've got to really promote

263
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You get number a little bit better

264
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,760
So I'm here for the Thanksgiving week and of course work work continues here. I have no idea in a of the

265
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,440
First of all first thing I'm gonna do this morning when I get in as I'm going to

266
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:18,360
Sit and meet I think at least ten people who have not met yet who have joined since the last time I was here

267
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,360
Which was only a month ago

268
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,360
And of course I'm going back

269
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,800
for a quick week at home and then I'm coming back for another ten or fourteen days just before the holiday

270
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,960
Celebrations and of course second week of January we are moving house

271
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,080
So I've got a lot of stuff to do back in the U.K

272
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,920
And so you know, I figured I'm sure that there will be some lost souls here

273
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
It's always that way

274
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,440
You know during the holiday is always someone who doesn't have a place to go to or the plan wasn't

275
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,720
Go to go visit their family this year and so I'm hoping that I can pull a bunch of people together

276
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,040
And we can go out somewhere and we can have a nice Thanksgiving dinner

277
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,920
And you know of course that this this girl from San Diego Giselle has been calling up with some really

278
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,920
Sexual stuff she sent me a picture by the way as I asked her to and

279
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,120
I could get in so much trouble

280
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,120
She's very cute and she's then what she sent along with the picture of the thing she said

281
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,560
I can't even be repeated on not even on this show and

282
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,080
So you know what what's kind of like and I just I

283
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,680
Thought it was a joke honestly when she first started off

284
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
And now I'm starting to get a little bit worried

285
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Particularly when I heard

286
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,840
This call come into the voicemail line

287
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,360
Hey, I don't know who this is but stop fucking calling Giselle at home

288
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,360
Oh

289
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:51,960
That so here's what I what I think happened is she's been calling this this number and her boyfriend

290
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,920
Either saw the numbers dot well obviously I didn't call her

291
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:01,000
But he probably saw that number is dialed or received or thought it was received on her phone and called

292
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,440
Because she does call in quite a bit

293
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,960
That guy sounds really fucking pissed off listen again

294
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,440
Is now they at home

295
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,960
Oh man

296
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,400
And he sounds like seven feet tall like and beat me to a pulp

297
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,240
I think I'm gonna hang back on this one. Hi Adam. It's Phil from Cornwall just to let you know

298
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,720
Had a listen to the latest tweet

299
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,160
77 and it's titled as to you mate the

300
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,880
We're referring to you from

301
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,240
55 minutes 41 seconds and for Twitter. I think it's fairly

302
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,320
favorable

303
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,320
a piece

304
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,320
And not that you need the

305
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,320
Family whatever but

306
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,360
There you are

307
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,520
Will Harris from slash.net was there and mentioned he saw you so

308
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,120
If you're in a mood John's more like for the show so you'll probably will download it anyway

309
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,720
Just thought you'd like to know

310
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,760
Here's my tellings folder. Bye

311
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,720
Yeah, thanks for the heads up. I got uh now I do listen to uh to Twitter

312
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,880
And as you just referred to I wonder how they knew that

313
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,440
Usually I only listen when when I see in the show notes the chondavor acts gonna be on

314
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,040
Because it is a long show and I have you know even I have to

315
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:26,520
Select as to you know when I'm gonna listen to but I've gotten a lot of people saying that there's something on the show that I need to listen to

316
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,640
Hello Mr. Craig. It's a listener from Canada

317
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,440
Who unfortunately I didn't have the chance to listen to your show for the past months

318
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,320
But don't worry. I listen to you all summer can't be motivated during long work days

319
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:46,680
I just listen to Twitch. Would you say you listen to if John C. Devore Act is a member and I will admit

320
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,920
Yes, I sometimes do that myself

321
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,720
Well, it just maybe bumps on my priority list

322
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,960
But I think you should take them off on it because

323
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,600
On their deal

324
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,000
Because I think it would be really interesting just here your side of the whole story

325
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,880
Well, not your side of story, but we're in pain

326
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,720
That's a little interesting, but I do I do agree with some of you

327
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,480
Oh, okay, I get it. Ah, yeah, some guy it's podcast con UK interviewed me and he

328
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:20,360
He's a sometime he does a sometime appearance on on Twitter. Oh, okay, so what they were ragging on my

329
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,360
My sweater and they have some kind of bet. All right. I will listen

330
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,240
I'll have to find out what the Twitter boys are up to folks on serious satellite

331
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,080
If you want to hear the rest of this podcast, you're going to have to go to daily source code dot com

332
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,320
Because it's just outlasting the satellite window. I'm so sorry

333
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,760
Pretty good

334
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:48,920
Pretty good thought here. Hey, Adam. This is more cramsy in Austin, Texas and to simplify things

335
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
Why not just call it

336
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
D-S-C-D

337
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,440
Yeah, for yeah for for for Roman numeral

338
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,760
500 is that it I guess the D

339
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,600
I don't know. I mean for those of you who are wondering why these are numbered

340
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,640
It's something we figured out a long time ago. It's so much easier for people on the go to just

341
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,840
Hit the play button and know right from the get go if it's a show they've heard or have not heard

342
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:20,200
And these is way to do that is obviously by by numbering it and people do it kind of seem to remember that

343
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,000
And as mainly done for the nano users who had no display

344
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,440
But also for lots of other mobile devices that just you know don't display

345
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:34,360
Thing this show note to the title in in a fashion that you know that you could probably do on the go if you're driving et cetera

346
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:43,720
So I will just keep on going 502 501 by by tomorrow and I want to wind up today's celebratory episode with song from

347
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,240
Actually it is these song. I have to say that really got my juices flowing

348
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,600
Two years ago over two years ago

349
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,200
When we well I guess when we started numbering the shows

350
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,480
It was all talk back in the time

351
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:07,240
I think that we smartly had all kind of figured out hey wait a minute. Maybe we we should not be playing any music because

352
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,040
This music licensing thing is is very complicated. This is before the pod set music network as well

353
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,840
The music licensing is complicated and we got something really interesting going here

354
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,480
Why don't we just stay away from playing music all together because the last thing we needed

355
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:28,120
Over two and a half years ago is to have you know the RIA brand podcasting as some type of

356
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:35,960
elicit pirate activity and and so that's literally what it was there were very there were still little equies

357
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,680
Remember that we used to talk about it's the who was it who said that's still the liquid

358
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,520
Podcasting is nothing more than solid liquids which of course is partially true, but it's become so much more

359
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:53,080
But I do recall bumping into a band online who had their there's their songs online

360
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:59,240
Available for I think was a preview listen or whatever or no. I had one song you could actually download and they were selling

361
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:09,080
There's CDs on CD baby completely independent four girls from New York and I really really thought the song that I had found which is for off of their CD was so appropriate

362
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:16,120
In so many twisted ways is to what was happening with with this thing that at the time wasn't even called podcast

363
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,200
podcasting we didn't really have a name for it

364
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:25,240
That I you know, I sent the singer of the band and email and said hey, would you mind if I if I played this song?

365
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,840
Oh my I'll my show over here and I send you I'll give an example

366
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,120
She said yeah absolutely knock yourself out and so I put a link back to to their site and where they sell their CD

367
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,680
And as I said I you know iTunes even and no, I'm sorry not I would they selling it on iTunes

368
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,240
I think they might have had it on iTunes at that point

369
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,720
but definitely a CD baby and

370
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:51,000
And and I played it and then a couple other people who were experimenting along with us in those early days played it and then a few weeks later

371
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,560
I got and email back that said hey, you know, we're actually

372
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,040
selling CDs because of this and that's when I got that's really

373
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:04,200
When when Ron and I started to work on the pod save music network, you know, how can we make that I mean obviously it's working

374
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:11,400
There's there's I can now legally use content to fill up my show which I love doing it's it's you know to me

375
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,680
It's the same as

376
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,800
Someone's sending an audio comment. It's you know, it's someone's passion their art their their soul

377
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:24,360
And you know, they want to get credited for it and and if possible, they you know, they have a business model

378
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,200
They want to make some money so we came up with the idea for the pod save music license

379
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:35,000
And so really was in those early days this song that band that got my juices flowing and they have not stopped

380
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,360
In fact, they're they're pumping quite quite fast at this very moment

381
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:43,880
Of course, I'm talking about the listidious bitis and I want to be famous

382
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,840
That girl I want to be famous

383
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,880
He got it's art is how parties that's spy

384
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,920
I want to be famous go to Paris on private flights

385
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,080
I want to have lovers by the score

386
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,920
Movie producers knocking down on my door

387
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,480
This is the fate that is in store

388
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,440
For me

389
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:44,600
When I'm famous, I will wear the great trench coat and fake red hair

390
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,600
So they all will know that it is me

391
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:57,800
When they see me how they'll smile and me photo grass to sign

392
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,440
I will say sorry babe talk to my assistant

393
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,680
I want to be famous

394
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,680
Tabloids will bring what I eat

395
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,960
I want to be famous who I do will be news on the street

396
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,280
Then when I'm old, I'll have a ball

397
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,720
Then be shocked that I'm living at home

398
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:28,760
When I enter the gas will fall to the knees

399
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,680
And then I'll snap the throats on my head of peace

400
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,240
But all I don't want one in cheese when I'm famous

401
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,680
Spameless, famous, famous

402
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,680
So exhausting

403
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,760
I want to be famous

404
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,760
I want to be famous

405
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,760
I want to be famous

406
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,760
I want to be famous

407
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,760
I want to be famous

408
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,760
I want to be famous

409
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,760
I want to be famous

410
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,760
I want to be famous

411
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,760

00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,760
I want to be famous

416
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,600
La La La La La la!

417
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,560
La la.

418
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,760
Wow, I will be a Marby dog

419
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,480
If you fished head and have said

420
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:44,760
Oh

421
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,880
And I hate the attitude

422
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,800
And oh, whoa, whoa!

423
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,900
Everybody, I won't get high on

424
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,460
I don't get high on colored pills, Martini's dry

425
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,660
A little way and just a touch

426
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:11,260
I wanna be my famous better than all of my fellow much better than all of her

427
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,820
I wanna be famous slowly and alone at the end

428
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,860
I'll end up bitter and ugly and old

429
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,300
Not just my body, but also my soul

430
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:30,780
But a legend is my goal and a legend of being

431
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:36,460
When I'm famous, not only I'll give for the little people

432
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,900
I don't have kids when I'm famous

433
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:44,780
Hey, my famous famous, bye-bye-bye

434
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,620
From New York City, the Sylvia's Bitties, and famous

435
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,740
You see how music really is the soundtrack to our lives

436
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:56,700
Or I used to be radio and convinced it's things like podcasting

437
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,060
Because it really took me back in time to those days in the curry castle

438
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,180
And, you know, just north of Antwerp

439
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,780
And, and was just playing the song over and over again

440
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,820
And it was, it really, it was so funny and it still

441
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,260
It fits in in so many ways

442
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,460
I think you know what I mean

443
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:20,300
Anyway, you know, we're working, we've been working the past week on

444
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,660
A big pitch for a very large advertiser

445
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,300
We have a pretty, I think a pretty cool idea for them

446
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,180
And it's a video pitch and so a lot of

447
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,580
We ask a lot of people to help out

448
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:34,300
Because this would be a big network wide thing

449
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:38,700
And, and obviously it kind of shows an overview of a pod show

450
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,460
But also podcasting in general is that you're just what is out there

451
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,980
And when you look at it at all the different shows and all the different

452
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:50,860
Creative talent it's just we've done that we've accomplished so much

453
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
In a relatively short amount of time

454
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,260
That it really gave me chills just keep watching this thing over

455
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,660
I'm like wow, you know, I forget the pitch part

456
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,060
I'm just like, look at all the stuff that's been created

457
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,460
And look at how rich our lives have become

458
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:10,220
Because of what all all these creative people have have tasked themselves to do

459
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:17,020
And, you know, I certainly still feel as my mission to enable as many people to do that as possible

460
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,980
So thank you all very much

461
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,020
This is it for episode 500

462
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,740
