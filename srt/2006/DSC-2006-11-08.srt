1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Think the show can't get any better. Think again.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,280
In just days, podshow.com unleashes the new podshow plus network.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,920
Not necessarily in that order.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,920
Oh, snappin' eye are debating which is best, scrunching or folding.

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,520
Scrunching, folding, scrunching, folding!

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,560
Uh, don't you think that's a little weird considering both of you wipe your butts on the ground?

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,400
You are go for you know. Oh yeah, why don't you boys just introduce the show?

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,200
Ready happy? Ready snappin'?

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,280
Delta series, Charlie, four, nine, two.

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,960
With 15 bags of splinters stuck in our hands, sugar!

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,400
And 15 bags of toilet paper hanging from our cracks.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,880
We don't need no sticking sugar!

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,720
I'd like to think I'm right.

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,560
For the future, I hope, for the future, for the future.

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:30,480
They're heavenly liberty Jones, works in the shop that she owns, listens to music like swing.

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,360
When there's no customers in,

19
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,440
just because she don't like to drive.

20
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,440
Take the sea as stood five.

21
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:57,920
And tease her thoughts out of sight to the river at night.

22
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,920
If this is your selfie, why don't you come for me?

23
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,680
Take me away from my friends.

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,160
If this is your fault, why don't you worry?

25
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,120
We keep your mind back to my face.

26
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,160
If this is your selfie, why don't you come for me?

27
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,840
Take me away from your memories.

28
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,640
If this is your fault, why don't you come for me?

29
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,480
If this is your fault, why don't you come for me?

30
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:54,480
She's got a dream that I'd like

31
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,480
Because her name would imply

32
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,480
If things are only designed

33
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,480
Is it you, Sophie? Why don't you go?

34
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,480
Perfect, take me away

35
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,480
You can ride those

36
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,480
Is it you, Sophie?

37
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,480
I wish it to be what but

38
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,480
We could go by but to my face

39
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,480
Is it you, Sophie? Why don't you go for me?

40
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,480
Take me away

41
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,480
You can ride those

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,480
Is it you, Sophie?

43
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,480
I wish it to be what but to my face

44
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,480
Is it you, Sophie?

45
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:55,480
I wish it to be what but to my face

46
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,480
Is it you, Sophie?

47
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,480
Why don't you go to my face

48
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,480
Is it you, Sophie?

49
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,480
I wish it to be like this

50
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,480
Is it you, Sophie?

51
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:22,480
I wish it to be something

52
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:46,920
ning at the podcast con Uk?

53
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Hey, we can't after next, and I hope to introduce them if I'm in the country on the island.

54
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,920
The known as the United Kingdom.

55
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Liberty Jones, could find them on the podcast music network.

56
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
Gosh, I love that.

57
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,920
What a great song, really, really good.

58
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,920
Everybody, how you doing?

59
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,920
It is Wednesday coming to you from the Curry Cottage in the affluent suburb of Suri

60
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,920
The Alberta is the daily source code episode 491.

61
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,920
Thanks to the govers for opening up the show.

62
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,920
I'm sorry, 492.

63
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Yeah, you're listening to one tired mofo today.

64
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,920
It really started yesterday morning after only three or four hours of sleep.

65
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,920
Ron and I had a big meeting presentation over to BT at 730.

66
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
I love it.

67
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,920
And you know, as I've said before, with these bridgemen, particularly the BT guys, 730 is 730.

68
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,920
There's no two ways about it.

69
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,920
So, of course, we stayed up late preparing and there was stuff going on at the office at the evening before.

70
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:57,920
So yesterday was kind of, after we were done Ron and the lovely diva Marta jumped on on the plane back to San Francisco,

71
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,920
where Ron, I think, went straight to the office because of our unleashed.

72
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
Now, now we had some fun yesterday.

73
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,920
I don't know if you caught it, but we knew we're going to have significant downtime.

74
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,920
We're switching over to pod show plus 2.0.

75
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
Or as I say, it's 1.9.

76
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,920
That was right.

77
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
It is 1.9.

78
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
It's almost 2.0.

79
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,920
We've still got a very, very tired team working hard on stomping some bugs.

80
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,920
I think we're going to probably send him to bed and just forget about it.

81
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,920
We'll fix everything else tomorrow.

82
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,920
There are time tomorrow, which will be our time today here in the UK.

83
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
That's what it is, man.

84
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,920
It's like there's no good time to do this stuff.

85
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,920
It's always going to be late, lots of late hours involved.

86
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,920
But what was cool is we did our first dry run of the plus, which is our 24-7 video station.

87
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Amy Mac hosting talking to folks at Pod Show, there were interviews around,

88
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,920
quarter to two here.

89
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
I just had to stop.

90
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
I couldn't watch any more.

91
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
I was too late and you had to get up early.

92
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,920
And we had kind of a restless night because one of our cats, Cindy,

93
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,920
we have two and we're very, very fond of all of our animals as you know,

94
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,920
didn't come home.

95
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Now this is not abnormal for the cat not to come home during the night,

96
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
but it is getting a little bit cold.

97
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
So that really bothered Patricia.

98
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
So she slept kind of restlessly.

99
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,920
I know she went out of bed even after I went to bed to go and see if the cat was at the door.

100
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,920
And he wasn't funny thing, though, this morning, the neighbor came by had Cindy, had the cat in a cage.

101
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,920
The neighbors have a cat.

102
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,920
And this and every single cat in the neighborhood hates this cat.

103
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,920
In fact, when we moved here are the neighbor across the street,

104
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,920
and Mary and said, oh, you know, this cat over there,

105
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
the terrorizes the entire neighborhood.

106
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,920
And we were like, I know whatever, because our cat definitely doesn't take any shit.

107
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,920
And they have been fighting for two years,

108
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:52,920
often on the, our cat and the ferocious tabby cat have been fighting.

109
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,920
Now there's been trips to the vet, you know,

110
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,920
holes in his head and stuff.

111
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,920
And so the neighbor has Cindy in the cage.

112
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,920
He says, well, once again, he was in our house,

113
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
and he got locked in the closet,

114
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,920
but I just want you to know that he sprayed the entire house.

115
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:15,920
I say, Mark went up for the good guys.

116
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,920
Way to go, Cindy.

117
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,920
Patricia is off to the dentist, otherwise she would have given us a blow by blow,

118
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,920
because I was actually upstairs doing stuff for the serious programming today.

119
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,920
And she actually answered the door.

120
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,920
So, hopefully, you know, we are actually still married,

121
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,920
and we do live in the same house,

122
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,920
and we have a life together.

123
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,920
She's just, you know, coming onto the show just hasn't worked out.

124
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,920
Anyway, so everyone worked really, really, really hard.

125
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,920
And we've got the new pod show plus up and running.

126
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Some pieces aren't working, some things are buggy.

127
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,920
What's being worked on right now is your channel feeds.

128
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,920
If you make a channel, that feed seems to be broken right now.

129
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
So, that's being fixed.

130
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,920
The video uploader is also not working.

131
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,920
We'll help him wait until you try that shit, man.

132
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
You're going to love it.

133
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
It's really cool.

134
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,920
So, now we have four networks under one network.

135
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,920
We've got music from the pod set music network.

136
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,920
We've got people.

137
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,920
Of course, we have a huge network of people who are on pod show,

138
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,920
plus we've got shows, which includes everything from traditional podcast,

139
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,920
audio, video to, well, to some full-blown productions.

140
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,920
Like port city PD, which we'll talk about later on today in the show.

141
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
And there's video.

142
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,920
And we're doing something, I think it's really cool.

143
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,920
It was great to see sod was indeed, he's responsible for search,

144
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,920
and also a video.podshow.com.

145
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,920
And he was talking about, oh yeah, no.

146
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,920
We just got and steal all the stuff from YouTube and Google.

147
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
We bring in the top things.

148
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,920
If you want to see the top videos across the internet,

149
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
just a kind of pod.

150
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,920
Ah, very funny.

151
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,920
Very, very funny.

152
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,920
New tools for producers, lots of new things for, for users,

153
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,920
audience members to interact with their shows.

154
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,920
When we get a work again, you'll see that you can create

155
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,920
collection channels, so feeds essentially, of any element,

156
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,920
not just of shows, anywhere on the site we see a picture,

157
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,920
or a single episode, or a video, you can just drop it in,

158
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,920
as well as with a show and create a custom dynamic feed.

159
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,920
I mean, there's a lot going on.

160
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,920
I haven't even found all the things myself yet.

161
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
So, yeah, so that's the warning.

162
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,920
We're all kind of tired, and we know that things still are kind of broken,

163
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
that there's a stuff that has to be fixed.

164
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
But I'm sure in the next 24 to 36 hours,

165
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
that's all going to shake out.

166
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,920
And then within that time period,

167
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,920
BT.pot show.com is also going to launch.

168
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
So, busy, busy, busy.

169
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,920
There's like 50 people who are just hanging on by their fingernails,

170
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,920
but so cool to hear, particularly the British audience,

171
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
being very excited about this unleashed.

172
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,920
And was it talking about that two days ago

173
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,920
that I really had noticed the British audience has really,

174
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,920
you know, picked up on the DSC?

175
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Well, here's the theory.

176
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,920
I had on this shelf, not just on my way,

177
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
work, but on a program of folks.

178
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,920
Yeah, thanks for playing out fucking Christmas tune.

179
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
It had suddenly got colder.

180
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,920
So, it's the morning of the seventh,

181
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,920
I get to congratulations in order.

182
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
Your BT podcast, Ian, it's happening.

183
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,920
And do you, if I wanted to say,

184
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,920
you still seem to be, you seem to be surprised.

185
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
A lot of the British are phoning up.

186
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
We seem to have remembered the number.

187
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,920
Well, one, you told us to put the bloody thing in our night in our phone books.

188
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,920
But also, I think the popular audio,

189
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,920
amongst the British, can be attributed somewhat to the fact that you're here.

190
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,920
And you're talking about areas that we know,

191
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,920
places that we go to, places that we know of,

192
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
and I'll familiar with.

193
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
But when you're talking about the state,

194
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
they haven't the damn clue what you're talking about.

195
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
I really, I really don't know.

196
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,920
I know of the largest city, but there's some pieces.

197
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
Only.

198
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,920
So, it just feels a little, a lot more local.

199
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,920
If you were in the state, and you were talking exclusively about the state,

200
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,920
I wouldn't tune in anyway, it's game at night here.

201
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
So, yeah, congratulations.

202
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
Please see, bye.

203
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, dude.

204
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
Blok, I mean.

205
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,920
So, a question for you.

206
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,920
When I'm in San Francisco, and I'm there for two weeks.

207
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,920
Do you listen less?

208
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,920
Because I'm talking about things more local there.

209
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
You know, just a thought.

210
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,920
Great to show on television last night, by the way.

211
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Was it, I think it was ITV.

212
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
British heroes.

213
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,920
I think I said, was that totally true British heroes or something?

214
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,920
Ah, what a tiered jerker.

215
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
I'd tier streaming down my face.

216
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,920
See, now that's what I call a piece of local conversation.

217
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,920
Because people in the states are going, huh?

218
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
I don't care.

219
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,920
The hell is going on, I wonder.

220
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,920
And now we're from our spine tier.

221
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,920
It's the yanks versus the brits.

222
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,920
We'll drive each other crazy, but everybody knows that it's a parent to see.

223
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,920
Let's just like you and me, it's the yanks.

224
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,920
And the brits, the yanks versus the brits.

225
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
Mind the gap.

226
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,920
So, one of the things that I'm learning here is how

227
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,920
the traffic violation system works.

228
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,920
When I told you that our car was snapped on camera, speeding twice,

229
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,920
doing about 40 and 30 zone and gone through this whole rigour

230
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,920
morale and they asked me to send my driver's license, which of course I didn't do,

231
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,920
because I have a Dutch driver's license.

232
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,920
It is international or internationally accepted,

233
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,920
but so apparently they'd want to take points off.

234
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,920
And people are sending me a lot of information about driving.

235
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
It seems that this is one pretty big scam though,

236
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,920
but this morning, as I was listening to the voice mails,

237
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
and that number again.

238
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
Here's what came in this morning.

239
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
Disconcerning to say the least.

240
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,920
Hello Adam, this is Paul calling from Battersea.

241
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,920
Notice he doesn't give me a last name.

242
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,920
Adam, I thought I'd called to talk to you about your recent experience with the speed cameras.

243
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,920
And to just give you a quick warning,

244
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,920
you've been squeaky clean so far on music like this thing,

245
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,920
but I think you've dropped the car in terms of the seriousness.

246
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,920
Yeah, luckily I haven't violated any controlled substances laws either.

247
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,920
This is of what you've just inadvertently walked into.

248
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,920
You probably don't know, but failure to give information

249
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,920
as to the identity of a driver can be an offence in his country.

250
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,920
So then go on and deliberately supply false information,

251
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,920
amounts of drops in the police,

252
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,920
or attempts into the vertical suggestives.

253
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,920
And the bad news is that this can lead to a conviction

254
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,920
and a prison sentence.

255
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,920
So what's a face out of you seems to be quite a simple matter of a speeding offence.

256
00:14:52,920 --> 00:15:01,920
You've now gone on the air on a podcast and admitted that you're now providing false information to the police.

257
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,920
Okay, I didn't go back and listen to the episode,

258
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:13,920
but I think what I said is that the mail was sent to Brian Curry first of all.

259
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,920
So I corrected them on that.

260
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,920
And I presumed pretty much, and so does Patricia, by the way, that she was the one that was speeding,

261
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,920
but we don't know for sure.

262
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,920
We don't know. I speed all the time.

263
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
Oops.

264
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,920
Just did it again.

265
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,920
You could probably add to that as well,

266
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,920
that you're now also liable for three penalty points,

267
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,920
and what's called an NS90.

268
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,920
So both Patricia and yourself and now both eligible for penalty points.

269
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,920
You know, it sounds like you know a lot about this.

270
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,920
You've been down to the form numbers NS90.

271
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:54,920
My advice would be to quickly write back to the police,

272
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:00,920
and just say to them that you misunderstood and inadvertently gave wrong information

273
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,920
and split them with the correct information.

274
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,920
That way, at least they won't come back to you as any of your listeners,

275
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,920
healthy, provide the police with your podcast.

276
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,920
Oh, now do you hear that?

277
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,920
You hear that, my friends?

278
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,920
Which one of you would go and help the police without information?

279
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,920
Maybe only James from Battersea?

280
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,920
Not very good news, but that's the way it works.

281
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,920
And by publicly telling people you're getting false information,

282
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,920
you might be asking for someone to knock on your door quite soon.

283
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,920
So good luck and the structure.

284
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,920
Right.

285
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,920
Of course you're a scruncher.

286
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,920
Man, I do not like the tone of that message.

287
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,920
It was really pretty frightening.

288
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
Oh, I just remembered.

289
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
Of course it was me.

290
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,920
Yeah, yeah, I remember.

291
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
It must have been me speeding.

292
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,920
That was when I was testing out the cruise control,

293
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,920
when I said it to 40 instead of 30.

294
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,920
Yeah, that's right.

295
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,920
Dude, from Battersea, you're more frightening in this guy.

296
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
Yeah.

297
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,920
My original stocker is back.

298
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
Hello, I've been Roger Hayer.

299
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
I've got a question for you to ask,

300
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,920
Blender, the sugar paper.

301
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,920
Once you know why, don't go and make tea bags with sugar inside.

302
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,920
I hope you're not working too hard.

303
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,920
I've just finished my exams today.

304
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,920
And I'm going to be free a little more.

305
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,920
If you'd like to go out for a drink later.

306
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
You know, my number.

307
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
So bye for now.

308
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:56,920
Oh, you don't hear from the guy for months.

309
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,920
And then all of a sudden he comes back with that.

310
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,920
Interesting.

311
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,920
Roger, I think that's a pretty good idea, actually.

312
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,920
I think we should go and propose it to the splendor folks.

313
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,920
I think we should talk to them about that.

314
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,920
That's not so stupid.

315
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,920
And, you know, same for Jennifer, you're not low.

316
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,920
You're not low from food philosophy.

317
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:23,920
You know, why wouldn't we have folders with the, with the splendor flavoring put right in?

318
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,920
And the tea is a good idea.

319
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
Is it possible?

320
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:33,920
Can you, I guess you can put tea in sugar or sugar substitute or sucralose or whatever it is.

321
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,920
Splenda, as all I know.

322
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,920
I'm not one for flavor teas, but I, you know, flavor teas is a huge market.

323
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,920
In fact, in the Netherlands, which is a big, big tea drink in country as well.

324
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,920
You can hardly get a regular good old cup of rosy.

325
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,920
You know, rosy Lee would be a cup of tea.

326
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,920
He did it again, integrating into the UK.

327
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,920
Roger, are you going to be at podcasts on UK?

328
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,920
I think there's a lot of people who would finally like to meet you, my friend.

329
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
I really do, including myself.

330
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,920
And now that I know that you're inventor as well, that's very, very, very compelling.

331
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,920
So we got this new show on the network, which I'm very excited about.

332
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,920
It's called Port City PD.

333
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,920
And what's, what I like so much about this show.

334
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,920
Since here, I was Splenda.

335
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,920
Is, that it's done by, it's done by people part time.

336
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:34,920
It's, I'd have to say, amateurs, although they've gotten sponsorship in the form of products.

337
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,920
For the show, so they kind of are professional.

338
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:43,920
But, you know, it's like 20 people work on this to create an episode, a cop show,

339
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:50,920
which, for me, doesn't, is, is on par if not above anything Steven Batchko can do.

340
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:56,920
It's really good, the writing, the actors, the cinematography, the sound effects.

341
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,920
It's fantastic.

342
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:04,920
Oh, you're running a promo, just before the unleash, a promo for it on the homepage of Pod Show.

343
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
Maybe you saw it.

344
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,920
I can play some of the audio for you here.

345
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,920
The soul of the city is plagued with corruption.

346
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,920
I used to believe in justice.

347
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,920
Now, I'm on the air.

348
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:34,920
I'm going to tell you how I really feel.

349
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
I hate that.

350
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
I'm going to tell you how I really feel.

351
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,920
I hate that.

352
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,920
Wow.

353
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,920
I just want to say,

354
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,920
Okay, let me just tell you how I really feel.

355
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,920
I hate that.

356
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
I hate that.

357
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,920
Okay, Adam, we just want to let you know how we feel about this.

358
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,920
We're just, you know, we just want to be someone who we are.

359
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,920
Well, this is Robin.

360
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,920
I'm sorry, Adam, and this is Suzanne.

361
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,920
We're from InsideWorks.

362
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,920
And the divicast.

363
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,920
And we just want to start a dialogue about this.

364
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,920
Yeah, this is an, oh, my gosh.

365
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,920
How can this be on the first page of Pod Show?

366
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,920
You know, I feel like we're members of the Pod Show family.

367
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:22,920
And this is in congruent with who we are as InsideWorks and the divicast.

368
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,920
And for that matter, right underneath this advertisement, the very first thing.

369
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,920
And I know it's random.

370
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,920
Hold on, hold on, hold on a second.

371
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,920
First of all, advertisement is the wrong word.

372
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,920
It's a promo for the show for another network family member,

373
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:49,920
Poor City PD, who, you know, get treated with equal respect and equal vigor throughout the network.

374
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,920
You know, we, we try and promote everybody equally across the board.

375
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Very interesting, you guys take offense to this, particularly because you should know that at Pod Show we don't judge content by

376
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,920
Hmm, what is the word I'm looking for?

377
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,920
By its content, essentially.

378
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,920
You know, are you offended by yeast radio?

379
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,920
Are some people actually could be offended by, that's where you're going to talk about.

380
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,920
The bedtime stories, my kids love the gofers.

381
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,920
There's political shows, left and right wing.

382
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
We don't judge.

383
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,920
We don't take a stance on any of that.

384
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,920
Care, don't care to because then it wouldn't, it would be my network.

385
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,920
It's not my network.

386
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,920
It's our network.

387
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,920
Let's find out why they don't like this.

388
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,920
You know, it pops up, but it was bedtime stories, my kids love.

389
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,920
That was the very next thing in the director right underneath this advertisement.

390
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,920
So does that mean, I mean, bedtime stories, my kids love.

391
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:03,920
Does that mean that you can't enjoy a hard-hitting cop show?

392
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,920
If you want to listen to bedtime stories, if you want to play bedtime stories for your kids.

393
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,920
And what was so bad?

394
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:16,920
Did you see actual, you saw a lot of guns firing and cars peeling out?

395
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,920
What did anyone get killed?

396
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
I don't think so.

397
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,920
It's just such a contrast.

398
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,920
Yeah, it's an uncomfortable contrast.

399
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,920
For you, for you, it's uncomfortable.

400
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,920
For you, it's uncomfortable.

401
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,920
I wouldn't, it's not uncomfortable for me.

402
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,920
And you are the only people who have, um, who've complained about this.

403
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,920
Doesn't mean that other people aren't uncomfortable with it.

404
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,920
But let's listen to this because this really interesting stuff.

405
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,920
Just, I don't like it.

406
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
I just don't like it.

407
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,920
That's not a really interesting story.

408
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,920
That's what I want to do is give you some feedback.

409
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,920
Let you know what we think about it.

410
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,920
And we give it two thumbs down.

411
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,920
So I want to start a dialogue about this.

412
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,920
And also Robin, I just want it before you know what, before we close,

413
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,920
I just want to say, what it taps into for us.

414
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,920
And I'm sure we're not the only one.

415
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,920
But what it taps into up for us is Robin's mother was murdered.

416
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,920
And she was shot in the head.

417
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,920
There was blood spilled everywhere on the carpet.

418
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,920
It was absolutely horrific.

419
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
And so.

420
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,920
Whoa.

421
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,920
Okay.

422
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,920
I can understand.

423
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,920
Now I can understand why for you guys this might not sit well.

424
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,920
Although I don't think that, again, there was no blood splatter.

425
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,920
There's no shooting of people through the head.

426
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,920
It's just a promo.

427
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,920
It's a promo for something fictional.

428
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,920
You know, you just.

429
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,920
Ship, man.

430
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,920
The satellite window is closing.

431
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,920
Are you folks on serious stars one or two?

432
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,920
If you want to contribute to this conversation,

433
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,920
you have to go to dailysourcecode.com.

434
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,920
Download the show or click on play it and listen to it.

435
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,920
So you can hear everything else that was said about it.

436
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,920
Okay.

437
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,920
Understood.

438
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,920
Oh.

439
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
Hi, honey.

440
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
What's up?

441
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,920
Yeah.

442
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,920
I'm recording as do you see face microphone microphone face.

443
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
Yes.

444
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,920
Mouth open words.

445
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
Um.

446
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,920
How to go.

447
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,920
You have.

448
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,920
Okay.

449
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
I'll talk to you in a second.

450
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,920
Okay.

451
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
I'm just in the middle of something really heavy.

452
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,920
As typical.

453
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,920
For us to have to just see all the.

454
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,920
It's not that we don't like some violent movies.

455
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
I mean, you and I go see some different stuff.

456
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,920
It's not that we're all a crunchy totally.

457
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
Okay.

458
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
Okay.

459
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
Well, then what's the problem in this is.

460
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,920
But this is to the extreme.

461
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
Well, and it's.

462
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,920
I was it to the extreme.

463
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,920
Why?

464
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,920
What was the extreme part about it?

465
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,920
All I've heard so far is I didn't like it.

466
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,920
And it's a surprise when you.

467
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
It's in your face.

468
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,920
When you go to pod show and we told in our listeners in the past go to pod show.

469
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,920
But you know, when you have.

470
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,920
The match-weinstein.

471
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,920
A Richard blues thing, talking about americans on East Radio.

472
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,920
Also, that's been on the homepage when you've.

473
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,920
Kalilvo has who definitely exploits her.

474
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,920
herself.

475
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,920
Her beautiful, sexy self.

476
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,920
You don't take offense to that.

477
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,920
Wow, this is it's a personal thing.

478
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,920
And I don't think we're going to have a discussion about it because.

479
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,920
Well, it'll never end, it will never end.

480
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,920
You know, now we're going to, we have to have a rating system.

481
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:25,640
exactly what we wanted to rebel against. Now, I'm not saying that it would be boring to

482
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:31,720
me to have this type of promo on the homepage all the time or even more than a couple

483
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,520
day, even more than a day. I want stuff rotating all the time. But, you know, to say that this

484
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,840
shouldn't be on the homepage, that's just wrong. I'm up for a new account. Yeah, we really

485
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:47,560
promote Potcho and haven't seen this now. I'm like, wow, I can't do that right now.

486
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:53,160
Yeah, I feel uncomfortable with that. Why? I want to look, I will listen to one more comment from

487
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:59,160
you guys. Why? What are you still uncomfortable about? What is so incredibly wrong with that promo?

488
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,600
Not a single drop of blood, not a single body falls. It's just a whole bunch of noise.

489
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:12,440
Violent noise. Violent noise. I'm not comfortable with sending people to Potcho to sign up

490
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,400
with that being on the first page. So, Adam, I guess what I hope is that.

491
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,280
Okay, so we'll put a whole bunch of govers on the front page and bedtime story shows and

492
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:28,040
diva cast and inside works. Come on, guys. You're so intelligent. You're so much smarter than this.

493
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:34,360
This is a personal thing and it bothers you personally, but you have to recognize that we can't

494
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:40,440
be in the business of censoring out what the members of our network are making and I'm proud of

495
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,320
whatever one makes. Really proud of it, particularly port city PD because they do it on a almost

496
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:50,840
zero budget. These are volunteers. They were volunteers. Now, you can finally give them a little bit

497
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,240
of a production budget to get something going, but they've been doing this just because they wanted

498
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:03,880
to do it. So, we can't make that kind of art anymore because then you don't feel comfortable

499
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,680
sending your friends, but don't send, don't send anybody. Robin and Suzanne, you're here

500
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:14,360
by forbidden to send your friends to Potcho. No longer. Um, number one that you kind of hear us when

501
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:22,520
we say this to you. In number two, that you just respectfully contemplate what we're saying and

502
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,040
that you don't just discard it because you don't like the message because I know it first,

503
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:31,000
you might be thinking, oh, well forget those guys and blah, blah, blah. But we really, I love the

504
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:36,680
DSE, love Patricia, love Christina. Yeah. And I guess, um, Robin, we just want to leave

505
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:42,280
with two things of what we would like to see potentially happen. One is either to modify

506
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:50,040
you want to censor promo or to just to move it. So, I'm not saying to censor, but just to move it

507
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:55,240
either to a different place. So, it's not on the front page. It's not the first thing people see

508
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,880
or to modify it. So it's not so graphic and violent. All right. Love you, man.

509
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:08,120
There wins. Okay, Adam, and thank you for hearing us and bye for now. You know, you guys sent

510
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,360
me the first time we met, you guys sent me a comment when I was getting a lot of heat from people,

511
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,640
just about Potcho and just in general. And, you know, not that that's really stopped.

512
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,480
But you guys said something really smart, which, and I wish I'd gone back and found that episode,

513
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:30,440
but too lazy, frankly. You said, don't accept other people's baggage. You're doing exactly the same

514
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,400
thing. You're trying to put your baggage onto me. It's unfortunate that your baggage is really

515
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,800
fucked up because I can only imagine what it's like. You know, but is it, is it any worse,

516
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:45,160
you know, to see your mom die over the course of two years from lung cancer until she's just

517
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:51,560
nothing more than a bag of, a bag of bones lying there, gasping for air? Is that any worse?

518
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,800
Is that any less graphic? Is that any less disturbing? I talk about that all the time.

519
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:03,720
Is that any, you know, I just don't think it's any worse than then having your mom murdered.

520
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:11,880
Dead is dead, but don't try and push your baggage onto me. It's clear that this is a part of

521
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:19,560
popular culture. Shit, man, do you watch music videos ever? So, I'm not, I'm not, as you say,

522
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:25,880
Suzanne, I'm not saying forget those guys because of the message. I'm saying it because you clearly

523
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:32,280
state that this is a personal issue and will all your friends that you are no longer allowed to

524
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:38,600
send to podshow.com until you clean up your act. I love that. Are they going to have the same

525
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,720
baggage? No, probably not. They may not be that offended. You just might find out and go look at it again.

526
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,480
And by the way, I would really appreciate it if you would look at the show.

527
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:54,040
Look at the show and give me an honest critique of the show for it's for the artistic value and the

528
00:30:54,040 --> 00:31:01,320
work that would into it. Please, and by the way, this is all very much a representation of what's going

529
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:08,200
on in the world around us. This is really happening. The stuff you see in music videos is a representation

530
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,240
of the world around the makers of those videos. The stuff is really happening. You can't hide it

531
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:21,720
on another page and move it off the homepage. You don't have to. I need a chill. What happens when

532
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:29,320
two of podshow's sexiest podcasters get together? The booty needs to be shaken sometimes,

533
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,880
you know? It's just an important part of life to shake the booty. I was like,

534
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:39,880
disgusting, important things. I know. I was trying not to be a sex object. You recognize that

535
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,040
it's happened. It's happened whether I want to do it in my own. Not to treat you like a sex object

536
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:49,640
though. It's really difficult. I don't feel like a sex object can't find a baby really made a connection.

537
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,800
So you guys didn't hear it because it was happening during the song, but Angie was actually typing

538
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:02,920
me a little love messages on Skype and they're very, very, they're very, very secrets the things

539
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,880
that I will never share with anyone. Okay, so maybe I've embraced the sex object thing.

540
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,520
I think some babies have been created listening to a free and easy.

541
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,560
I got to tell you, I was looking at the plus last night as the engineers and the whole team was

542
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:34,520
working on bringing a podshow plus 2.0 and we rolled out the chill cast. It was real and I was sitting

543
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:40,040
here. You kind of got to imagine the scene. I was sitting in my in the studio office second bedroom.

544
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:46,200
And I had the stream full screen. I figured out if you if you right click on the for Windows users,

545
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,400
if you right click on the on the video and you can zoom to full screen. So boom, you know, I'm sitting

546
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,200
there and Angie B pops out and I'm kicking back in the big ugly green chair and I'm smoking away

547
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,720
and I'm drinking some tea and it was just it was she was sexy man. It was great. It was I even

548
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:09,960
I emailed her. I mean, this is Angie. Angie, it's so sexy, baby. So she teams up with Julian Smith

549
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,920
for a dual cast. I think it's did actually go out on you know, over your head. I think so.

550
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:22,520
You know, over your head, dud net. Still very happy with the Nokia E61. Not being paid for that.

551
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:30,600
Should be battery life, not bad. You know, this is what happens when you get a new new device

552
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:37,480
particularly with Wi-Fi and it's got, you know, all kinds of Bluetooth is consistently honest.

553
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,440
It's got all kinds of real battery slurping applications. Went through a whole day, you know,

554
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,800
problem, including all the extravagant work I've been doing. It was so cool. I'm on the train.

555
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:53,880
And I've got the I've got a scallop was a scallop 500 Bluetooth earpiece. It's only one

556
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,840
unfortunately only one year, but it kind of worked out because I'm on the train coming back

557
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:05,560
from the office and shortage, which is in London. And I threw the Wi-Fi at the office. I downloaded

558
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:11,240
a couple of shows, you know, just through the podcasting application, which Nokia, they actually didn't

559
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,400
come bundled with the phone, but of course you could download it and install it. No problem.

560
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:21,640
And so I'm listening away. I'm checking my email and then the phone rings. The podcast stops playing.

561
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:26,360
I answer. It's Patricia. We talk. I hang up. The podcast starts playing again. It's fucking cool.

562
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,040
All on one headset. Really, really cool. And then I got a message.

563
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:35,560
Yesterday, what do you got a message from? I might as well mention since I'm using Gmail.

564
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:47,320
There you go. Robert. There we go. And he turned me on to this thing, Goosink.com, golf,

565
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:54,520
Oscar Oscar Sierra Yankee November Charlie.com Goosink. And apparently you can then sink your

566
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:04,040
your Nokia or Nokia with your Gmail calendar. So I'm like, yeah, yeah, I'm sewing to that.

567
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:09,960
And so you sign up and then you're supposed to receive a text message. I guess with the link to the

568
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:17,240
application and an installation instruction, the text message never came. So now I'm registered.

569
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,320
I've been on to their forum. I've seen three other people have the same problem and no response.

570
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:27,880
So I remember upon sign up, it said, you know, oh, if you have a Nokia, then it'll just send

571
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,320
your text message or you can install it manually. And of course, I clicked on that, you know,

572
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,200
to go past the install it manually part. And that you can't go back to that page. So now I can't

573
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,320
figure out how to install it manually. It's really, really sucks because I, you know, that's like

574
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:49,640
to talk about the missing link. It's going to be so cool. I have to say Google really is changing a

575
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,640
lot in the world.

576
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:05,480
Hoody friends, just don't know where's he here. You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have no

577
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:14,360
delivisions, no DVDs, no interweb become pewter thingies. Nope, we had the wireless radio in our

578
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:20,280
imaginations to entertain us. Join me as I wander down memory lane with my friend Robert,

579
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,680
as we listen to the podcast from yesterday. Available at history here dot pot show dot com.

580
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:36,440
Yeah, it's cool. Excellent show. So the rest of the day will be spent working on pot show plus

581
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:43,240
2.0, BTpot show dot com. Shoot, I hope the show even gets up normally. It looks like all other

582
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,240
feeds are working well. So that shouldn't be a problem. I haven't actually tried cast blaster. So

583
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:52,040
we'll find out soon enough if that works. But the overall vision is pretty clear. You know,

584
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:59,080
you'll be able to manage your media, your friends, your music, your shows, and put them anywhere.

585
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:05,240
So forthcoming from pod show, a mobile application, you think it's an accident that I have this

586
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:16,200
Nokia, which really kicks ass. A, of course, IPTV. So it'll work on on your set top box

587
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:22,600
across the world. I think I saw some messages about Tvo. I mean, this is we're really getting

588
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,680
the distribution. It's really, really kicking in the high gear. And I got to tell you, I'm

589
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:33,480
chaffed my friends. Suggested sent to you by Tino Felon. Adam, you'd like this one.

590
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:39,720
Bit like the Peshitamo, Durand, Durand, and others from that time. And of course,

591
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,040
on the pod save music network. Okay, Tino.

592
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:11,880
My turn, moving up the line with something warm, my mother told me I said I'm gonna keep

593
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:17,880
in your line. All good things can't diverge in me.

594
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,880
My turn was here.

595
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:22,280
For a miracle, always come in late. Everybody holds and everybody waits for something

596
00:40:52,280 --> 00:41:12,280
energy out of me. Everybody holds and everybody waits for something energy out of me.

597
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:33,720
Yosa, sorry, a little distracted there. A stereo movers. And waiting, thank you very much for

598
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,280
the suggestion. Of course, you can find a link to that, which is on the pod save music network

599
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:45,560
from daily source code.com. Folks from Canada. And just getting some news in here. Let me see,

600
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:55,960

601
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:01,160

602
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:10,120
metal region every single one of them. We're doing the earthly clues. That's right, baby. Earth

609
00:42:54,600 --> 00:43:01,640
Now Andrew Grummit is still on what times it for him? Crap. It's a, if I calculate backwards,

610
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:08,840
six, wait, I'm going the wrong way. Am I, oh, Jesus Christ? It's like 530, 435, 30 poor guys.

611
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:19,400
Okay, so most, I guess most of it's working. So stay tuned. Updates will follow. And of course,
