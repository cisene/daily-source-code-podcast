5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,680
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,680
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,680
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,680
But yes, dear.

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,680
It's an old curry.

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,680
The other end.

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,680
I'm going to give you a moment.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,680
It's not something that you just don't something out.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,680
It's not a big drive, right?

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,680
It's a series of tools.

15
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,680
Tools.

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,680
Tools.

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,680
Time to let tools.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,680
I just the other day got in and I was set by my staff at 10 o'clock in the morning fighting.

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,680
I got it yesterday.

20
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,680
Time to let tools.

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,680
I keep up my sense.

22
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,680
Because I've got time to let with all these things going on the internet.

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,680
Conversely, I think it's absolutely essential.

24
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,680
This is the tip for my streaming stuff.

25
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,680
I have to go out and down and down and down and down and down and in and in.

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,680
That's a bit strange.

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:48,680
I don't have to have that kind of speed.

28
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,680
I don't think anyone here is to find what the net quality is.

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,680
It's not a big truck in the series of tools.

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,680
And here we have this one situation.

31
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,680
The streaming process that internet.

32
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I

33
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:55,820
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I stop, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't I can't, I can't, I can't be

34
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:03,820
tubes. Why did we do that? Why? And normas tubes.

35
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:16,820
Massive tubes. It really is in that consumer-bill of life. Because it got tangled up with all these things and going on the earth.

36
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:43,820
The world has turned against this. Everybody how you're doing. I love that song. I found it a couple days ago. Now it's on the pod save music network.

37
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:52,820
From the bold headed pod cast. It is DJ Ted's techno tubes. And there's also extended version. I'd love it so much. I was on the plane.

38
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:59,820
I should let me see if I have that for you. I was on the plane coming over from London to San Francisco.

39
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:08,820
And I was digging that so much. I actually came up with a tube's cowbell remix. Hold on a second. Do I still have that here?

40
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:17,820
I probably already trashed it. It wasn't all that good. So maybe I should remake it. Anyway, how you doing everybody coming to you from Northern California looks like it's going to be.

41
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:24,820
Well, not too short. It's not going to be a super sunny day, but it could burn off pretty quickly. I'm in the curry condo.

42
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:37,820
Here for another another stint on the oil rig. But boy, it's going to be a lot of fun. Today we've got board meeting, which is the first one we've had in a while. Of course, it coincides neatly with

43
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:53,820
with the unleash of pod show plus and a whole bunch of initiatives that are going down. There's so much happening. So much. Not just in my life, but in your life as well. And I cannot believe. I cannot believe. I fuck this one up.

44
00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:14,820
Check it out. Hi Adam. Danny Boyle here. I just wanted to wish the pod safe music network a happy birthday on July 15th. And question why you hadn't mentioned it. Is it something in the branding? Is it going to go away or change names or become something else? Is the pod show plus kind of the be the future? Anyway, happy birthday.

45
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:43,820
Well, let's say happy birthday to all the artists on the pod safe music network. All of the podcasters who are a member of the network. And of course, extra mega special thanks go out to Chris Rockwell, Sioux Fleming and CC Chapman. We really worked hard. And that was more than a year ago at launch the year ago on July 15th. But it was so funny. This was built via Skype before pod show existed before even Ron and I.

46
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:51,820
I decided to go on and create a company. Well, I guess it was kind of at the same time. We knew that this had to happen. And we were just excited.

47
00:05:51,820 --> 00:06:00,820
It only took a couple of months to do. And the site looks like it. But it it fulfills the prophecy. And that's what I like about it so much. So congratulations to everybody.

48
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:11,820
Well, up onwards to the next year. And then the next. And who knows how big we can blow this mother out. But I'm very excited about it. And of course, no, we're going to leave it the pod safe music network.

49
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:19,820
Obviously, we need much better integration with pod show plus. And we made some decisions early on. Let's get to pod show plus out.

50
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:25,820
Then we'll start integrating everything because you have all these databases that got to talk to each other and do all kinds of things.

51
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:31,820
And, you know, why do you with that when you can listen to wonderful messages like this one?

52
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:41,820
Hey, Adam, and everyone at the daily source code. This is Lindsey from Carlisle, which is in the north of England. Just wanted to tell you something Alan.

53
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,820
Who's Alan?

54
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:54,820
Adam. Sorry mate. I just wanted to say, Adam, that our first child was conceived to the sound of the daily source code. My wife is just announced that she is pregnant with our first child.

55
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:02,820
And it's all down to you and Patricia. Yes, it was playing there in the background as we made sweet words.

56
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,820
People could work here. Adam, and I'm going to be a daddy.

57
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,820
Yeah, baby.

58
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:15,820
Okay. So a couple of things about that comment. First of all, it was sent through the voice mail numbers.

59
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,820
And if you're in the car and the train or on the bus or you're anywhere that you can grab your mobile phone.

60
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:28,820
And once you grab it right now and punch these digits in so you have them because you know that's going to be a point when you just have to say something and you're not going to have the number handy.

61
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:34,820
So entering plus where you could do, yeah, just do plus that's easier. Two zero one.

62
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:47,820
Six two five six three five seven and we have a UK numbers well in London plus four four two zero seven six eight one three seven five three. So you call me with this fantastic news and I got to tell you that is great.

63
00:07:47,820 --> 00:08:00,820
I love hearing this story, but I need a little bit more detail. You know, it's like was it a Wambam. Thank you, man. Was it was it. I mean, we actually were you listening and laughing to what we were doing while you were doing.

64
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:08,820
Or were you totally ignoring us? Do you remember which episode it was? Was there something in particular at the right moment that really made it work for you?

65
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,820
In acquiring minds need to know you got to call me back buddy.

66
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:24,820
Oh, yeah, it's been way too long. Thank you, this the man is back on the scene.

67
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:34,820
Hello, I've been Roger here. Now you mentioned on your recent shows that you're interested in looking at women's rest in public, which coincidentally something that I enjoyed doing too.

68
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:56,820
Hold on a second before you get the wrong idea. No, what I mentioned is that it's so nice in the UK when the weather is so warm and we're going through a virtual heat wave in most of the world, but in the UK specifically we're looking at 92 93 degrees is like 30 to 35 degrees.

69
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:08,820
And then what happens in the UK is particularly in London that while they just start popping out is women just love showing them. So I guess I guess I do love watching him, you're right.

70
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:42,820
And when they walk into the freezes section, they tend to pop out like this, but if you want to be conspicuous, then I recommend that you wear some of those back sunglasses and not those rose colored ones that you've got as the way you might get kicked out for harassing customers.

71
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:51,820
Also, if you wear your sunglasses, it means Patricia won't know that you have in the pervever and I'm sure they're coming you for when you drive past all the types on the street.

72
00:09:51,820 --> 00:10:04,820
I'm sure there's nothing better than staring at a couple of jeans, toes sticking out, rather you're out buying fish fingers. So he wants to meet up in the magazine section, number lunch break, and then I can show you all the best places for high.

73
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:16,820
What do you do? Don't go down between 9 and 11 in the morning because that's when all the pensioners go shopping and I think the only thing you want to see are a pair of shoes that fry eggs, press that against delicate housing counter.

74
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,820
So that's my suggestion for this week, go and check out the flags it's saying it's bris.

75
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:28,820
And I also wanted to let you know that I'm a squenching off-road, because it's a lot more so, right? And it doesn't get as much new sprint round you ring.

76
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,820
By now, Russia!

77
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:38,820
Oh yes, sometimes you'll stock here, sometimes you'll just throw you some love through the phones. It is Roger Smalls, ladies and gentlemen.

78
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
Yeah!

79
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,820
Greetings, Adam. This is Chuck Palm, once again calling from Tampa, Florida.

80
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,820
One of the lets you know about a new show we're putting out on ESP Productions, shameless plug.

81
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,820
That is the casting couch, a pot show plus network show.

82
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,820
We wanted to let you know about it. The host is my boy Flash from a country station here in Tampa.

83
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,820
The 19th market is what he wanted me to say.

84
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:17,820
It's a talk show style format, and our first episode we started talking about the podcast phenomenon,

85
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:23,820
and who was involved, and we mentioned the pod, father. I thought I'd put that out there to you.

86
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,820
There's about two minutes at the end of this, feel free to edit for content.

87
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,820
We wanted to let you know that we really appreciate the pod show plus network.

88
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:35,820
I think it's a great thing. We've got three shows up there right now.

89
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:42,820
My URL is chuck palm.podshow.com, and you'll see the casting couch is casting couch.podshow.com.

90
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,820
Check out that show. I think you're really going to like it being a reform DJ yourself.

91
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:54,820
You got to listen what happens when you put a couple of country DJs in the same room, put a podcaster, a producer, and a voice guy,

92
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,820
and a couple of cases of beer. It was an absolute riot. We had a blast.

93
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,820
Take care, man. We'll shout out to you soon.

94
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,820
All right, dude. Thank you very much. Casting couch.podshow.com.

95
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,820
You can go get your own piece of that internet if you want at podshow.com.

96
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,820
You can find all kinds of shows. You've got a program guide.

97
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,820
You can collect your own channels. You can put stuff together.

98
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,820
You can create an entire, an entire radio station of your own,

99
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,820
just consisting of podcasts that you'd like to listen to.

100
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
Share them, show people what you're listening to.

101
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,820
Dig people. Do all kinds of fun stuff.

102
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,820
Excellent, dude. Excellent. Thank you very much for the feedback as well.

103
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:35,820
Told that I was flying over the weekend, and how busy it was on the radio.

104
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,820
I mean, this is the busiest corridor in all of Europe, where in all of Western Europe,

105
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
where we happen to live and where I'm flying.

106
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:47,820
So I'm confident enough now to do it, but I got this wonderful piece of feedback here.

107
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,820
Let me see, this is from, here we go.

108
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,820
From Dwight Dunlop, from, where's he from, from Ottawa in Canada.

109
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,820
And of course, the saying does hold true.

110
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,820
If idiots worked here, we need air traffic control.

111
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,820
Hey, Adam, you ever have days like this?

112
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,820
I'm talking to the numbers. I'm counting on you to go down the runway.

113
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
Now, don't touch down and show it to ZK.

114
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:20,820
You know, I got to say that.

115
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,820
It's good fly. We need air traffic control.

116
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,820
Listen to that. Listen to that.

117
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,820
Listen to that control.

118
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,820
I'm going to go hide somewhere and see if they've all landed.

119
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,820
I love that.

120
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,820
Don't land short. Use the whole runway.

121
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
I got someone coming up here, but okay, forget about it.

122
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,820
Just do it. Go around.

123
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,820
Yep. That's the stuff you never hear when you're just flying around.

124
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,820
Is it passenger?

125
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:48,820
Hey, wow. The feedback on shadow falls has been outstanding as I knew it would.

126
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,820
Gosh, and I listened to the final mix.

127
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,820
Because I only heard a rough edit that Patricia and I listened to.

128
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,820
And I listened to the final mix on the plane right over.

129
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,820
Wow, man. That was just awesome.

130
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,820
And I had the big Sony headphones on.

131
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,820
You know, the ones that Patricia bought for herself that I stole from her.

132
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,820
And people are digging it.

133
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,820
Really are. I've seen responses to shows before.

134
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
But this is this is beyond belief.

135
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,820
You can check it out at shadowfalls dot pod show dot com.

136
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,820
It is an originally produced drama series.

137
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,820
It's audio only. So you can listen to it anywhere you want.

138
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,820
It's about 24 25 minutes each episode.

139
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,820
And this first one really sets the tone.

140
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,820
I'm totally totally excited about this.

141
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,820
Can't wait to see how the story of Molly unfolds.

142
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,820
Also, big news today on the pod show front.

143
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
We released pod show pro.

144
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
Of course, you have the pod show plus.

145
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,820
Now you've figured out what that is.

146
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,820
And we've got a pretty cool deal with with aim.

147
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
I don't know if you've ever seen, you know,

148
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
A well instant messenger, of course.

149
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,820
So there's an aim pro version, which is completely without,

150
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,820
you know, without all the wacky colorful.

151
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
It's a business thing. Really.

152
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
It's a business instant message application.

153
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
It's aim for business users.

154
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,820
And what's cool about it is now that we've released pod show pro,

155
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,820
which is for a small medium sized businesses.

156
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
I guess big business could use it as well,

157
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,820
but they'd probably want a more custom solution.

158
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,820
But it also, it really focuses on business podcasts.

159
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,820
You can find that it pro dot pod show dot com.

160
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,820
And I believe today as well,

161
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,820
if you download the new A well instant messenger pro client.

162
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,820
So that's aim pro.

163
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
It'll work with your existing aim account.

164
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,820
There's a little, a little icon at the bottom.

165
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,820
You click on that.

166
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,820
And I think you can listen to some streaming channels.

167
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,820
But right there, pod show pro.

168
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
And you can have your, your channels set up.

169
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,820
So they can play right inside your instant messenger.

170
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,820
So this is just another example of,

171
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
of really what we've dreamed about.

172
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,820
You know, having a place where you can manage all the different places

173
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,820
your podcast go to.

174
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,820
So whether it's on your iPod, your MP3 player, your cell phone,

175
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:04,820
your TV, your, uh, your instant message client,

176
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,820
you know, it can go anywhere.

177
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,820
And you can manage it all from one place.

178
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,820
And I'm really, I can tell you how much stuff is just coming at us.

179
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
It's now it's starting to happen.

180
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
This is the point where we wanted to get to.

181
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,820
Sure, we've got at least a couple more weeks of clean up to do on,

182
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,820
on the pod show, plus side getting all kinds of just bugs,

183
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,820
stomped on.

184
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,820
But also some thought mistakes we made,

185
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,820
which, of course, is a, is so beautiful now that it's,

186
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,820
it's still in beta.

187
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,820
We can, we can, we can mess around the night.

188
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,820
Of course, appreciate everybody's patience as we do that.

189
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,820
But shit, it's coming together now.

190
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,820
I think the channel bug is working.

191
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,820
So shows don't fall out of your channel.

192
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,820
Um, and, and I was amazed this morning when I woke up at, like,

193
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,820
five, thirty quarters six.

194
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,820
You know, there it was.

195
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,820
All these shows that I, that were just sitting there,

196
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,820
ready for me to play.

197
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,820
I was like, yeah.

198
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,820
Finally, someone helping me listen to podcasts.

199
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,820
Hi, Adam.

200
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
I'm, um, this is counselor.

201
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,820
I am the French speaker.

202
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,820
Yeah, it's like a blur.

203
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,820
It's one of these lazy French bastards, isn't it?

204
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,820
I'm, um, between the UK and Ireland.

205
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,820
I just want to give you two feedback today.

206
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,820
The first one is about a biodiesel.

207
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
I run a pleasure field six.

208
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,820
So what is all?

209
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,820
And I pour biodiesel in it.

210
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,820
It's, it's great.

211
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,820
The crown's better.

212
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,820
It's cleaner.

213
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,820
It's smoother.

214
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
You can feel it, you know, the engine is more,

215
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,820
no performance.

216
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,820
And the best thing is that it only costs seventy five

217
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:28,820
pounds a liter, um, which is a bargain as far as I know.

218
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,820
Now, the second thing is,

219
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,820
Louis, on the elephant land, um,

220
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,820
there is something special about them,

221
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,820
a place over here.

222
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,820
Sorry.

223
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
And all in the place have to include

224
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,820
better M from other.

225
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,820
And N for November.

226
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,820
Um, so, you know,

227
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,820
you know, the place could be A, M, N,

228
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,820
1, 2, 3.

229
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,820
Now, what happens with some people

230
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,820
have related P for Peter.

231
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,820
So, day in November,

232
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,820
3, R, P, M, N, 1, 2, 3.

233
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,820
And, uh, without knowing that,

234
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
therefore, I've utilized the process,

235
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,820
music network.

236
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,820
I thought it was quite funny, um,

237
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,820
enough, I mentioned it.

238
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,820
Unfortunately, you cannot put those P,

239
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
M, N, or M, you know,

240
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,820
in November, place on a UK car.

241
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,820
Because you listen to me,

242
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,820
you're French lazy bastard.

243
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,820
What are you doing on the island, man?

244
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,820
And get me one of those license plates.

245
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,820
I want the PM, N, 1, 2, 3 license plates.

246
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,820
Please.

247
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,820
The French aren't really lazy bastards.

248
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,820
That just got stuck from that other guy.

249
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,820
Where is the French lazy bastard?

250
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,820
Actually, he used to check in a while.

251
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,820
He was telling us all about that,

252
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,820
you know, the iTunes stuff in France.

253
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,820
And now that that's changed,

254
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,820
I don't hear from him anymore.

255
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,820
I did hear from the podcheck.podcheck.com.

256
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,820
It was also on the podshow podcast network.

257
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,820
And she's doing a lot of really interesting stuff.

258
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,820
You know, she's into sky diving.

259
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,820
And she's been sending me, uh,

260
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,820
she's really never, uh, KFC.

261
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,820
She, uh,

262
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,820
KFC.

263
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,820
I don't think it really has a lot of experience with video.

264
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,820
In fact, when I first met her,

265
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,820
when she was first doing podcheck.com,

266
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,820
she didn't have a lot of experience with audio either.

267
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,820
And so I helped her kind of get rolling on that,

268
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,820
and she figured the stuff out.

269
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,820
And now she's editing these videos.

270
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,820
And so I'm just giving her some ideas as to,

271
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,820
you know, how you can make a show flow.

272
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,820
And I know a little bit about video,

273
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,820
not much.

274
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,820
I know a lot about jump cuts and wookie cans.

275
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,820
But she's,

276
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,820
that it's really the content that I'm so interested in.

277
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,820
What she basically has is hot looking chicks who are skydiving.

278
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,820
And in the, in the most recent clip,

279
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,820
she sent me.

280
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,820
I was like, yeah, you know,

281
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,820
I can really get into this.

282
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,820
It's exactly what it is.

283
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,820
It's hot chicks who go skydiving

284
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,820
and do other dangerous,

285
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,820
Daredevil things.

286
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,820
You might want to check it out podcheck.com.

287
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,820
This month on BFBS multimedia,

288
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,820
you'll use a friendly guide to computing technology,

289
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,820

290
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,820
It's a very special show.

Yes, we're celebrating our 100th program.

And to mark the occasion,

293
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,820
we've got to cake some sparklers

294
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,820
and the biggest competition give away in the show's history.

295
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,820

296
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,820
but 100 prizes in the multimedia competition.

297

More chances to win than ever before.

We've got a lot more chances to win than ever before.

299
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,820
We've got a lot more chances to win than ever before.

Congratulations, dudes.

308
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,820
It's 100 episodes, it's very good.

309
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,820
It seems like a lot of that is coming around.

310
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,820
Now, folks have been podcasting for a year,

311
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,820
or they've reached some kind of pillar,

312
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,820
which would be the 100th episode,

313
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,820
and I congratulate you.

314
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,820
If you've been using the Podgeau Plus dashboard,

315
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,820
is what I call it.

316
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,820
You might just call it the player,

317
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,820
but you'll see that this player has a lot more under the hood

318
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,820
than just playing stuff.

319
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,820
In fact, if you click on any Podgeau podcast,

320
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,820
you can have channels set up.

321
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,820
Just go to your Podgeau Plus tab on the dashboard.

322
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,820
And you'll see your channels right there,

323
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,820
and you can open them up,

324
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,820
and you can play them from there.

325
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,820
So no need to go back to the website.

326
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,820
You'll also see that the dashboard now plays

327
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,820
enhanced podcast.

328
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,820
Now, it's still a little bit hidden.

329
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,820
We're not doing all of the, in fact,

330
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,820
right now, I think the chaptering is what is available.

331
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,820
So if you subscribe to a show that is enhanced,

332
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,820
and has chapters,

333
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,820
and I believe sometime this week

334
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,820
will finalize the, you know, all the enhanced stuff,

335
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,820
then the pictures will actually rotate

336
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,820
in the, in the dashboard player,

337
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,820
and the links will be hot.

338
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,820
Already now, I think the links are hot

339
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,820
if there's chapters put in there,

340
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,820
and I believe that the images will rotate.

341
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,820
So go ahead and find your favorite

342
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,820
enhanced podcast,

343
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,820
and it will just work.

344
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,820
It's cool stuff.

345
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,820
Just like this show,

346
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,820
the popped up on Podgeau Plus.

347
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,820
This one blew me away.

348
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,820
It's so cute.

349
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,820
A mom and her 11 year old son.

350
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,820
Hello.

351
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,820
This is Dan.

352
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,820
And this is Shayna.

353
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,820
We're bringing you the mind and body cast.

354
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,820
This is our promo podcast.

355
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,820
We're going to be talking about our show

356
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,820
and what we plan to talk about.

357
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,820
Yep.

358
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,820
And we're going to be talking about vitamins,

359
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,820
skincare, all kinds of beauty,

360
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,820
you know, all that good stuff.

361
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,820
Are you going to cover the beauty stuff, Aaron?

362
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,820
Yes.

363
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,820
I'm going to lovely.

364
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,820
Aaron is my 11 year old son,

365
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,820
and we're both huge podcasting fans.

366
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,820
And we've just been listening

367
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,820
for over a year and decided to finally put

368
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,820
together a show of our own.

369
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,820
Check us out at mind and body cast.

370
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,820
Com.

371
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,820
Shoot us an email or a question,

372
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,820
mind and body cast at gmail.com.

373
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,820
Yep.

374
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,820
And so I'll be looking forward to young emails.

375
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,820
And feel free to send us any link

376
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,820
to anything that sounds good.

377
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,820
And they think my help is in a new podcast and experience.

378
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,820
And what did you want to listen

379
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,820
or check out on our website, Aaron?

380
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,820
The funny junk link.

381
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,820
I have a funny junk.com link,

382
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,820
which is links to funjunk.com,

383
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,820
which is some pretty funny stuff.

384
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,820
You can just click on the funny Aaron's funny junk.

385
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,820
And it'll take you right there to the links.

386
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,820
Click on one to view it.

387
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,820
And yeah, pretty funny.

388
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,820
So we're looking forward to that.

389
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,820
All right.

390
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,820
So we'll be talking to you soon.

391
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,820
Again, mind and body cast.com.

392
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,820
I'm Shayna.

393
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,820
And this is Aaron.

394
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,820
See you later, peace.

395
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,820
Yeah, this podcast.

396
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,820
Yeah, peeps.

397
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,820
See you later, peeps.

398
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,820
How cute is that?

399
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,820
You know, when I hear that,

400
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,820
I have this only one thing I really think.

401
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,820
I miss my mommy.

402
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,820
I really do.

403
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,820
And last time I was in San Francisco,

404
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,820
she was still alive.

405
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,820
So it was beautiful to hear that podcast.

406
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,820
Aaron and his mom on the mind and body podcast.

407
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,820
Find that on pod show plus.

408
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,820
Adam, see the piece.

409
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,820
London.

410
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,820
You said enough to use Charlie to go.

411
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,820
HD.

412
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,820
We don't have HD.

413
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,820
Adam on behalf of everybody.

414
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,820
It doesn't live in the state.

415
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,820
Just let me say something about you.

416
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,820
Sirius, we don't have serious.

417
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,820
We physically can't get it.

418
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,820
Even if we talk for it.

419
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,820
Why?

420
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,820
Why?

421
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,820
Keep on going on.

422
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,820
Everything left about serious.

423
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,820
I know you've got a commercial relationship with them,

424
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,820
because it means you can put your podcast on the serious.

425
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,820
That's fantastic.

426
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,820
Not a problem.

427
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,820
But surely peed up and sorted out for you every time.

428
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,820
And you can quite leave a small gap.

429
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,820
Rather than continually telling it every single day.

430
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,820
I'm a little listener.

431
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,820
I love the show.

432
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,820
But please, still going on about serious.

433
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,820
Adam, serious.

434
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,820
We don't have serious.

435
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:36,820
Dude, the whole reason I say that is to build the bridge between the listeners in the

436
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,820
United States who have the capability to receive serious.

437
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,820
And who can listen to Pacific Coast Hellway, which is coming up next.

438
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,820
It's just the bridge, my brother.

439
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,820
That's all that it's about.

440
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,820
Really?

441
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,820
Hi Adam.

442
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,820
My name's Nathan.

443
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,820
I'm calling from Australia.

444
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,820
It's one of the, say, been shooting in since about the mid 300.

445
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,820
Love in the show.

446
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,820
I think it's great.

447
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,820
I can't wait to get my fix.

448
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,820
I work away in the mine site.

449
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,820
Working two weeks on and one week off.

450
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,820
So I've got a way to travel with you to get my fix.

451
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,820
I think so.

452
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,820
I can take my trust as a little MP3 player and my laptop.

453
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:13,820
And while I don't have internet access to speak of while I'm there.

454
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:18,820
I can at least play with things on the MP3 player.

455
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,820
Had a question for you.

456
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,820
And you may or may not be offended by this.

457
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,820
And I apologize if you are.

458
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,820
Sadly some of us are old enough to remember.

459
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,820
And you can say that a like, a song from the 80s called,

460
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,820
We built this city by Starship.

461
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,820
Now, there's a bidding that where there's a DJ talking about.

462
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,820
He's from San Francisco.

463
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,820
Now, my question is in fact you.

464
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,820
I know your affinity with San Francisco.

465
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,820
I don't have to say I've listened to it recently since hearing your show.

466
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,820
It sounds like you do.

467
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,820
Great.

468
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,820
And could I see if it is?

469
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,820
That's fabulous.

470
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,820
It's not my apologies.

471
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,820
I don't want to offend anybody.

472
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,820
I know you're probably going to play it because it's nice and smooth.

473
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:09,820
But I wonder whether you could just play that little snippet of the DJ talks about it being a lovely sunny day in San Francisco this year by the day.

474
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,820
The city would be a bittersweet or that stuff.

475
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,820
Anyway, I hope the show is going well.

476
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,820
I'm loving it.

477
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,820
I'd love to do it from you more.

478
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,820
I'll be shooting him.

479
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,820
We're saying he liked it.

480
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:27,820
Maybe some sort of inspiration to your mind podcast and attack.

481
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,820
So the flyer needs tailwind and I'll text you soon.

482
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,820
Thanks, mate.

483
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,820
Bye.

484
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,820
All right.

485
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,820
All right, mate.

486
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,820
Thank you very much.

487
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,820
Yeah, it's interesting you say that because, well, the first of all, no, it's not me.

488
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,820
But when I was doing the countdown show,

489
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,820
and that's not the same as old Molly used to host there in Australia.

490
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,820
He had a show called Countdown.

491
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,820
I had the show in the Netherlands and in Europe called Countdown.

492
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,820
We had Starship visit the studio.

493
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,820
And this was around the time they had Sarah, was their head and we built this city.

494
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:01,820
So, of course, it was a grace lick and Mickey Thomas.

495
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,820
Mickey Thomas, who you might know from fooled around and fell in love.

496
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:11,820
They were the two main people in Starship, which, of course, was a

497
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:16,820
derivative of Jefferson Starship, slash airplane, et cetera, et cetera.

498
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,820
And when they did that song, they actually,

499
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,820
the camera cut away to a shot of me in a radio studio,

500
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,820
lip syncing that actual bit.

501
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,820
From San Francisco, the city by the bay, the city that never sleeps.

502
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,820
It's funny you mentioned that.

503
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,820
I just brought back a whole bunch of memories.

504
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,820
But no, it was not me.

505
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,820
I've done a couple of different things.

506
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,820
I did a Vandenberg album, I did some stuff,

507
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,820
and I should have, man, there's so much I've lost.

508
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,820
I wish I had all that material now.

509
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,820
See, I never gave a shit about it back then.

510
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,820
But, of course, we didn't have digital archiving.

511
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,820
We had huge real-to-real tapes that had a lug around,

512
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:57,820
or really shitty cassette tapes that just always had that hiss on it.

513
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,820
Frank Barnico sent in a comment.

514
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,820
He's been listening.

515
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:07,820
He writes for CBS Market Watch on the site there.

516
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,820
And he has his own weblog, Barnico.com.

517
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,820
And it's nice to hear his voice for a change.

518
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,820
Good morning, Adam.

519
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,820
Frank Barnico here from Barnico.com.

520
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,820
I think this data is bogus.

521
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,820
Right you are, Ollie.

522
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,820
I ruffled with that release last week from Nielsen that ratings,

523
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,820
which had lined about six and a half percent of web users

524
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,820
have downloaded a podcast in the last 30 days.

525
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:32,820
Something like 9 million people that 5 million or so had downloaded video cast.

526
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,820
Well, the first clue is something wasn't right, certainly.

527
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,820
And it was one of the words, podcast and podcasting were used in fairly confusing ways.

528
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:44,820
I call the analyst on the report and the company's PR person when he wasn't available.

529
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,820
After asking me to wait a bit while she checked, she came back and said,

530
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,820
yes, podcasts were podcasts.

531
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,820
Podcasts were people who listened to podcasts.

532
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,820
And podcasting was listening to podcasts.

533
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,820
Then I asked a bit more about the survey.

534
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,820
And the next day the analyst said, well,

535
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,820
the question about podcasting also mentioned music.

536
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,820
As in, have you downloaded music or a podcast?

537
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,820
So he said, the answer may well have been not as specific as we would have liked.

538
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:14,820
Now I think the problem here is this release wildly overstated how many podcasts

539
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,820
have been downloaded and how many people are listening to them.

540
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:21,820
We can't help but believe the answer included a heck of a lot more music responses than podcast.

541
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,820
Now I certainly believe there are a lot more podcasts being downloaded now than a year ago.

542
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,820
But any advertiser who takes this at face value and a podcast or ask for the order?

543
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,820
Well, does it as what they don't get?

544
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,820
But then the release was full anomaly.

545
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,820
It wasn't that Apple's browser the most popular for instance.

546
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,820
Reports I've seen given in that Explorer 85% of the market,

547
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,820
Firefox as much as 15% doesn't leave a whole lot left to Apple.

548
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,820
Think back to your TV and radio days, Adam.

549
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,820
Remember our ratings report that was screwy?

550
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,820
We call them fluke books.

551
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,820
Nielsen net ratings has given us a fluke book.

552
00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:00,820
Sorry back to you Adam and by the way I am a folder for crank market go at barnico.com.

553
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:05,820
You know Frank there's never too much information about you my friend.

554
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,820
Yeah I agree.

555
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:12,820
I you know it's I've never really paid much attention to ratings.

556
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,820
Not during television.

557
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,820
I was kind of trained that way.

558
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,820
MTV was the same way in fact it still is kind of the same way.

559
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,820
Typically there are about 300,000 people watching MTV at any given moment.

560
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:29,420
And in fact that was definitely when they still played music and then the whole and if you're interested

561
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,940
It's the YMT doesn't play music anymore. They were paying attention to the ratings

562
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:39,060
Because what would happen is they put on a show like it started actually with the remote control

563
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:44,620
MTV's remote control with that Ken Ober and Kari were and Colin Quinn

564
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:50,860
Colin Quinn. Yeah Colin Quinn and Steve trick us in the band. Oh, guys. How are you doing?

565
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,500
It's been a long time

566
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,860
Those shows would get like a 1.0 which meant

567
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,420
You know almost

568
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,460
Often twice or three times the amount of people who would be watching

569
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:08,380
During any other hour on MTV and so they said hey shit this short form stuff is getting as better ratings

570
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:14,220
It means we can sell more advertising means we can make more money and that's that was the death now of music on MTV

571
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:21,500
However, I think that what MTV's strongest property really is is the brand. It's a it's affinity with its viewers

572
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:28,940
And you know that of course changes over time and and people grow up and move on et cetera and you're supposed to flow right into VH1

573
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:35,900
Who now are playing metal video? Metallica is on VH1. I don't know what happened there. Maybe we're just all getting fucking old

574
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:46,140
But really it's the brand it's the big am the little TV and and I and I think that that really showed for me at least that advertising is not all

575
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,700
Just about reach. It's not all just about the numbers

576
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:56,620
It you know we're changing advertising as media as a media landscape is changing and it's of course the shotgun blast approach is a big deal

577
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,460
But advertisers are very very smart that we've talked about this before

578
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,980
They understand what influences they understand what a relationship is between

579
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,340
Content between programming and

580
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:14,140
It's audience at how audiences are now interacting. It's not just you know calling phone numbers

581
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,220
It's talking about it. It's posting about it on your web blog. It's linking to shows

582
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:24,060
It's actually buying purchase, you know purchasing goods and services that are discussed on on the show

583
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:29,100
I've sold so much stuff on the daily source code without ever intending to sell any of it

584
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,460
You know if I came out today right now right this very minute

585
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:38,540
If I came out with the folder scruncher toilet paper, I know it would sell

586
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,540
Hey Adam Dave from South Florida here

587
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:46,780
Just got an email from crews that I always go on called the rock boat and saw that at the bottom and had the logo for pod show on it

588
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:52,460
And I was just curious what was going on. You guys a sponsor or what it didn't really mention anything other than having that logo there so

589
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,940
How about some information on that man?

590
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:59,500
This is the my sixth one on there. I've been on all of them and it'll be a great time. January

591
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,740
Had not a lot of day will go into turns and cakeos for anybody who's interested. It's sold out

592
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,740
But I know they have a waiting list. Anyway

593
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,300
About some info man. Thanks a lot. Nice

594
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,140
Dude

595
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,940
Interesting. I don't know anything about it. Maybe

596
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:18,540
I really don't know rock boat. I've never heard of rock boat like I can imagine what it is

597
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,660
But send you more info dude send me a URL or something so I can figure it out

598
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:26,140
No idea. I'm sure it's someone with good intentions, but let's figure it out. That's a

599
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,740
Shoot if we got our logo on it. Can I get a free ride perhaps?

600
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,460
Hey good morning Adam

601
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:39,500
I was just listening to source code 422. You mentioned that the podcasters will be able to click and see

602
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,660
Did our listeners are how many of us pinnors they are see their faces in a rank with them

603
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:49,340
Is there a way that I as a listener can go to these podcasters not only

604
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:54,380
See some of the other listeners, but see how many people are listening to a certain show

605
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:59,580
Just curious of one or time to time how many people actually listen to this show along with me

606
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,380
Is that possible? Thanks

607
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,860
Yo

608
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,860
Well, if you go to podshow plus

609
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:12,620
There's a module you can that any podcasters can put right on there on their page

610
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,540
Which is

611
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:19,820
listeners and what it does is it not just shows you how many people are listening and that of course means

612
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:27,020
Who who got the show through podshow plus and I think I've got over a thousand now is just unleashed and in people are now starting to use it

613
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:33,420
But so not only can you use that number for yourself, but you can also see the actual pictures

614
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:37,820
See who those people are what other shows they're listening to. I like it as a podcaster. I like it a lot

615
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:42,620
But also as a listener I'll be listening to a show that it's just like the pod save music network

616
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,620
This is exactly the same thing that worked with that

617
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:50,540
Is you you hear a show you hear a song you check out the song what other shows are playing the song

618
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,940
Hey, they might have some other songs. I like it's the same thing

619
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:57,100
Who's listening to what show and you can see you know you can go through all

620
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:01,980
1000 people who who have gotten the daily source code through podshow plus

621
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:07,180
You can see what other shows that listening to what they have in their channels. It's it's it's pretty spectacular

622
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,380
It's exactly what we wanted it to be

623
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:15,820
Let's see. Oh shoot. I I did I not queue up the song. Oh, man. Oh

624
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:21,420
Oh, I saw a colonel second let me just load up this song here. There's a beautiful email

625
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,900
that I got from

626
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,420
Jason Miller from the finer points.net

627
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:31,660
How he says he left me a message on the voicemail, but I couldn't find it or couldn't retrieve it

628
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,860
And he said that he was going to send me a couple songs

629
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:40,140
And this is in regards to my mom. He says his mom died of cancer when he was 17

630
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:47,660
I wasn't able to be with her and that was very hard but it inspired the following song

631
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,260
So I want to play that for you as the last one on today's Charlie

632
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,020
To be there with you

633
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,100
It's where I should have been that day

634
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:26,700
If I was there I could told me that I loved you

635
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,260
Could have fell the hand in the water

636
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:44,300
I know that never could save you on that dark summer night

637
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:48,700
But I know that I could have been there

638
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:55,420
And if I was there we could talk all about you

639
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:02,780
Should have left me send you a sing up all the game

640
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,980
And I would have surrounded you with flowers

641
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:17,340
Try to think about it like it's a new beginning

642
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:24,460
And I would have given back some of the gifts you gave me

643
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,260
Make the best out of the first you'll find away

644
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:41,500
And I know that it could save something to make it easier on me

645
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:46,060
Should have known that it came from me

646
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,780
Should have known that it came from me

647
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:30,380
I could feel your blood and I feel your soul inside of me

648
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,420
You know I think that's who makes me strong

649
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:44,460
And I know that you're lying and I know that you'll still love me

650
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:49,820
I feel in my heart I hear in my songs

651
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,620
I feel like I'm one to get you

652
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:03,740
Maybe that's why I'm not afraid of dying

653
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:11,020
That's why I'm here and California

654
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:17,820
Maybe that's why I'm never stopped trying

655
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,260
Maybe that's why I'm never stopped trying

656
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:32,940
If I was there I know things wouldn't be different

657
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:40,140
I mean I know it wouldn't have ended any other way

658
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,300
I could have done nothing to be there with you

659
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,220
It's where I should have been that day

660
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:58,380
Jason Miller

661
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:04,060
Not afraid of dying Jason I'd love if you would put that up on the podcast music network

662
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:11,020
If not you can find that at the finer points dot net and I was fortunate to have been there when my mom passed

663
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:17,500
So I think I was able to say everything and more importantly I perhaps she was able to say everything she wanted to

664
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:21,020
Which was very nice and I listen that song and I think about your story

665
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:28,220
I'm just like wow you know I feel I feel really lucky really lucky that it you know what the inevitable went down and it went down on the way it did

666
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:33,100
Okay to wind it up a couple things you'll see new show notes today

667
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:37,100
This is I hadn't even seen this new feature in cast blaster

668
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:44,140
But there's an automatic show notes feature that we've talked about for a while and now it's it's actually in there

669
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:50,460
The minute you fire up anything any any audio element or a song or just anything you've got loaded up

670
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:56,780
It'll throw that into the show notes with a timestamp which I know a lot of people have been asking for and I've been wanting so I'm gonna

671
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,700
Put this out there and see what you think

672
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:06,300
It the spacing is a little bit a little bit wide forming or you know as like double spacing or whatever

673
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,700
But it doesn't matter. I think it's a very cool feature

674
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,860
In addition

675
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:17,340
So nice of cast blaster mic to hook up my sister willow willow.podshow.com with with a key for cast blaster

676
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:21,900
So now she's off to the races man, you know she could she could do the 10-minute podcast on with a free version

677
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:29,900
Now she's finding a Italian pod safe music and she's playing that and and she's taking the opportunity to tell me how fucked up

678
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,020
Podshow plus is that Bob who was a mom's husband

679
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:36,620
He bought himself an MP3 player on a USB stick and

680
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:42,380
He used to just download stuff via the direct download link and he couldn't find the direct download link

681
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,460
So yeah, we're putting that one in in fact

682
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,460
I know exactly where I'm gonna put it so that

683
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:50,540
You know we just make it as easy as possible for anyone and everybody

684
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,620
Alrighty

685
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:56,300
Time check we've got 739 which that's AM by the way

686
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:01,420
Which means I gotta get shoured up lathered ready for the board meeting which will be the afternoon

687
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:06,220
It's gonna be as I said. It's always a always a lot of fun to meet up with the the guys and gals and

688
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:13,580
Exchange ideas and and look at the strategy and where we're going and and how we're doing and how we're feeling and just so much love in the room

689
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:19,980
And and I'm sure there's gonna be a lot more. Oh, I'm gonna try and hook up with Andrew Rummit and do a dev cast this week as well

690
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:25,100
There's a lot of shit we got to talk about there because now we need to developers to come on in with your modules

691
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,620
We got lots of modules. We want to push through and there's a lot of requests for more

692
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,180
So you have yourselves a great day everybody
