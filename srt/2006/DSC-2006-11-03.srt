130
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,040
it should be deemed as such by Tony Blair there's just hope just big piles of

131
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,480
wires and

132
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,960

bonfire night and it's just gotten more confusing now we'll get into that in a minute

142
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,240
and it's other thing and this is kind of it's not pissing me off it's the

143
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,000
lack of response that's well it listened to this

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
uh...

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,520
explained the other day

146
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,800
that uh... the podfather logo

147
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,880
which is basically the podfather poster

148
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,120
with me on it and says podfather has been used for a couple years now

149
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,040
and the guardian newspaper is now plugging their three extra boner shows with rickie

150
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,400
jervais which by the way in paragraph or so you know like

151
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,280
in the second minute of each show he's begging for money

152
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,920
i guess that audible thing didn't pay off so well

153
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,680
uh...

154
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,880
he's using they're using the exact same poster and podfather moniker to promote that show

155
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,880
and it's just that's plagiarism

156
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,760
that's all and people are picking up on finally hello at the

157
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,560

159
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,760
podfather thing

160
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,200
just in the sense you're talking about

161
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,320
it seems to me that uh... you know they when they play the arson maybe you should

162
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,200
you know you put you should go off of

163
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,720
when he uh...

164
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,360
it's not the same sort of thing is when the

165
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,080
juts magazine went for a

166
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,280

169
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,960
years

170
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,040
that's uh... in you know in the court

171
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,120
i think he's basically said we're both they're taking your copyright

172
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,200
over uh... in this case is the device in the garden taking

173
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,560
portrait of the right

174
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,760
just a little

175
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,360
actually later

176
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,640
yeah although i appreciate the thought of course not i've absolutely no rights

177
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,040
i mean i stole the podfather uh... poster myself i actually i didn't do it

178
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,200
i didn't come up with a name podfather

179
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,800
but it just pisses me off that everyone's a fucking self-righteous when they think

180
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,760
pod shows done something a evil or wrong or

181
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,680
we stole and or hijack something and everyone's up and arms but then when it

182
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,160
respected mainstream media

183
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,600
uh... publication

184
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,080
plagiarizes everyone's fucking silent because it's about me

185
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,600
uh... it's just lame

186
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,960
it's just fucking lame

187
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,760
i got all your names and numbers too assholes

188
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,840
i added this is uh... johnson girl can ask us this up the road from here

189
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,320
little bit of the nation that bonfire night

190
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,320
the actual bonfire night is

191
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,640
this from a member which is sunday this year

192
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,200
but for practical reasons bonfire's occur

193
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,280
whatever it's convenient around that time

194
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,560
it's not on the fifth doesn't know it's all happened on a weekend

195
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,560
so there's no reason why we shouldn't be bonfire's on fire night or second night or something

196
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,280
night

197
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,680
and they're influential thinking also if i don't believe this

198
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,800
fog forecast of sunday may make saturday back at that anyway

199
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,360
they like to share an awful lot of times i'd follow this day

200
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,640
if you say to the air on the back of the night for seven nights

201
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,440
that's an out

202
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,400
older

203
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,960
and so we're planning this trip you know to go and uh... get video of uh... of bonfire night

204
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,520
no one gave me a straight answer on this thing

205
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,960
yeah so it's november fifth everybody agrees on that

206
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:27,080
uh... but apparently it's uh... going to be celebrated on the november fourth

207
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,440
on the uh... saturday night in a lot of places including gilford as far as i can tell

208
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,600
and i get all kinds of conflicting information let's see uh... david graham says

209
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,360
true bonfire night is the fifth

210
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,080
small garden parties will be held out often

211
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,080
will be held but often big fireworks as players are often delayed to

212
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,600
to the closest weekend there's more people will likely to go on that's not even

213
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,560
english man so this year will be saturday

214
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,640
okay uh... let me see do we have more guy fox night from john

215
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,160
go last cock

216
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,480
little research on the what on the web reveals these tidbits yet dude wikipedia is not

217
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,560
research anymore my book seems at the night of the fifth is bonfire night

218
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,720
throughout britain week commemorate the capture of guy fox bonfires and fireworks and

219
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,200
by burning an effigy of guy

220
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,480
uh...

221
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,200
by the way that uh... that nursery rhyme is a lot longer than the uh...

222
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,840
then the bit that we uh... that we're aware of

223
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,480
remember that this is a no-zember

224
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,200
jump out of treason and flocks i seen a reason why gump out of treason should never be

225
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,160
and it continues with guy fox guy fox

226
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,200
twesses intent to blow up the king and the parliament

227
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,200
three score barrels of powder below portled England to overthrow

228
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,160
by god's providence he was cached with a dark lantern and burning match

229
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,640
hola boys hola boys let the bills are it let the bills ring hola boys hola boys

230
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,760
i think that's what it is

231
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,200
god save the king hippy parah hippy parah

232
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,360
a penny loaf to feed all pop a farthing cheese to choke him

233
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,280
a pint of beer to rinse it down a faggot of sticks to burn him

234
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,080
that's interesting burn him in a tub of tar burn him like a blazing star burn his body

235
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,440
from his head then we'll say all pulp is dead

236
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,880
a faggot of sticks no less

237
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,360
and yet go there's some proper use of the english language

238
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,720
one more bob bonfire night

239
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,120

240
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,920
uh... deterred in the death of the show

241
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,160
uh... you're questioning about all fine i guess

242
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,480
traditionally on fire night fifth and a member

243
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,000
would you track his own day

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,040
but in those days uh... those people hold their events

245
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,640
and on seven night

246
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,360
and uh... are you fans or in the paper

247
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,600
uh... and then sell a couple weeks ago

248
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,920
but to sell about one by night

249
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,080

253
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,600

254
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,680

255
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,280

beat four from out in five thousand but she won't stop and she won't listen

Oh no, watch me, and watch me

How do we do your own song and story?

347

How do we do?

348
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
When are things and glory?

00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:47,840
We're both on time, all in every moment

352
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,580
something you didn't know you were going to kill him.​

353
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,640

358
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:05,120
7L AndSO Terric, you can find them in the Podajuian Music Network at music.podshow.com,

359
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,840
they're from Massachusetts,

360
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,300
that's from destiny, album and new dope lots of people,

361
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,060
there you go, which has been out for a couple of months, and I guess doing quite well, I love that.

362
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:23,420
very cool song. I told you the other day that we'll be launching with a new show in the

363
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:30,620
attic with Rachel Fuller and Pete Townsend of who fame and just next week actually and I

364
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:35,180
did want to point out that this is not a coincidence those of you listening to serious

365
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:45,020
satellite radio and hearing the show. The who who are currently on tour will well they have a

366
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:50,220
channel on serious right now it's called guess what the who channel it's channel 10 on your

367
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:55,980
serious receiver and every night at nine o'clock eastern time they play a full recent concert

368
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:02,700
recording by the who so actually tonight it would be the show from London which was recorded

369
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:09,980
2004 and let's see they've got another show they got show throughout the weekend as well

370
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:15,340
with Rachel Fuller's backstage reports as we know her the backstage bitch but that's only on

371
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:21,340
serious she's a superstar when it comes to pod show to check that out for sure. The comics are

372
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:27,100
blogger I'm sure will give us a report I think he can receive that at home. Let me just see here

373
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:35,420
for a second I had some more stuff and what to talk to you about. Hey wow Google released a

374
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:42,940
an email client for mobile phones the Gmail mobile app I guess it's called hey this thing is

375
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:49,420
really really good I tried it out on the the Nokia N91 phone damn it's like it's fantastic it

376
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,380
gives you all the functionality plus some of the shortcuts actually because you can use your

377
00:21:54,380 --> 00:22:02,060
your phones keep had as it does on the web it's really good really fast very nice even better than

378
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:08,700
the mobile web web page that I've been using I'm really really liking it of course it doesn't work

379
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:14,860
on the blackberry which is well that's a bummer to say at least now I do believe that I have a new

380
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:21,340
Nokia N93 come in my way so I know it'll work on that and that's really the only thing I'm worried

381
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:26,060
about you know about giving up the blackberry I'd love to have additional functionality but it's really

382
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:33,580
the speed with which you can navigate and create and and reply to emails and now it looks like

383
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:39,660
that problem will be solved you can go to gmail.com slash app and download it now they say it only

384
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:44,700
works for US networks but I tried it with my UK phone and I have I think a T mobile account works

385
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:51,580
fine so I don't think that's entirely true but man it's really really really cool totally digging

386
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,980
definitely check that out if you can. Hey Adam this is Chris and I find actually about just

387
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,940
on the road just listening to the October 31st episode of the DSC we're going to explain

388
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:06,700
that there are a small number of people myself including who are allergic to it what we're specifically

389
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:11,660
allergic to is the chlorine in it because it's one that's made circular this is made by you're

390
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:16,780
chlorinating sugar effectively so it's not so we're not life threatening it's just something

391
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:23,420
caused some discomfort and stuff like that but there are people who are allergic to it so if you

392
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:27,900
are chances are you should probably just not use it you'll know if you are the easiest way to tell

393
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:34,380
this obviously take a few days or possibly a week don't have any and then how to expose yourself

394
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:41,100
to dose of it either in soda or the powder form and see what happens if you have a rash or reaction

395
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,900
then you know splinters not feel it's the chlorine probably so you may be allergic to other chlorine

396
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,540
products may have a hard time for example using bleaching or laundry you may have a similar reaction

397
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:58,460
so that's the one thing about splinter my dad works for J&J and he's very very pleased with how

398
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:04,300
well splinters done in the market and glad to see that podcasts are sponsoring it but it's not

399
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,140
for everybody so just be aware that this is good so find actually podcasts trying to avoid

400
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:14,060
splinter every day that's all right that's cool dude some people got to avoid eggs you know some

401
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:19,900
people got to avoid me quite frankly so that's all right but appreciate the input there

402
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,660
and say hey to your dad we'll come up and take a factory tour one of these days it's the assembly

403
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:35,260
line or is he working at some desk job it's a fine product made with sucralose how the heck do you

404
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:42,300
pay for speeding tickets here in the UK this has this has me completely baffled this is speed

405
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:47,580
camera on the main drag near our house and you have to be going 30 miles an hour if you go above it

406
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:57,820
and of course Patricia was a snapped twice doing 40 you go through this series of unbelievable

407
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:04,380
postal exchanges before you can finally get to the meat and potatoes so the first thing is they

408
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:09,820
send you a letter saying was this your car and so of course I've had to do this twice because

409
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:15,340
there were two tickets like one week a week apart was this your car yes this was my car by the

410
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:21,180
way my name's not Robin Curry my name's Adam Curry and letterback were you the driver yes I was the

411
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:29,180
driver they got another letterback so do you wish to fight this or do you want to pay for it can

412
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:36,780
another letterback is 60 pounds fine okay there you go and then I have to send my license

413
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:43,020
they say you have to send your license I don't have a UK license I have a Dutch license I

414
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:49,500
got your mind I'm not going to send my license through the mail so I basically sent them 260

415
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:55,180
pound checks and a copy a color copy of my license but I don't understand why they make it so hard

416
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:01,980
for me to just pay the fine and move on with my life please Brits can't you help a brother out

417
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,980
understand then how it works can't you

418
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,220
Earthling got some bad press when they announced that they were installing a free

419
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,780
Munny Wi-Fi access in New Orleans do you hear about this or eat it in the news and people started

420
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:33,260
blogging and saying great now they have free internet but no food or shelter you know as if that

421
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:38,700
was somehow Earthlings fault okay now if I'm a large company looking to do something to help people

422
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:45,100
in need okay and I know how to do a thing internet service for example don't you think that's what

423
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:50,700
I'd bring to the table and offer up hmm maybe why would Earthling offer to rebuild houses are

424
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:56,140
provide food when they have no expertise in those fields right I for one think it's great that

425
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:01,020
they're doing something down there but you know who fought them the telcos the cable companies of

426
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,500
course thinking about a new internet provider give her a linkage ride at least they're trying to help

Oh, man, that's good.

452
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,780
Who Patrick Hall won for the ages,

453
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,780
brand new on the Podsave Music Network just went up yesterday,

454
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,780
he's from California.

455
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,780
I received from Arkansas and that kicked ass.

456
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,780
I love the classical bit in the middle.

457
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,780
It was fantastic.

458
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,780
I'm telling you that today.

459
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,780
It's Friday.

460
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,780
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Thursday Thursday.

461
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,780
Friday at a spinal thundering.

462
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,780
Yeah.

463
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,780
Well, I guess the final thought of the week.

464
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,780
I'll put my hand in my own bosom here for a moment.

465
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,780
Yeah, we complain about us rich people,

466
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,780
complain about a lot of things.

467
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,780
And by the way, if you're listening to this show,

468
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,780
you're rich.

469
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,780
Okay, compared to other people in the rest of the world,

470
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,780
you are stinking rich.

471
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,780
You're listening to this thing.

472
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,780
You got a computer.

473
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,780
You got some kind of portable player, something going on there.

474
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,780
Even people in a rock are rich compared to other people in the world.

475
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,780
I'm talking about Africa.

476
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,780
And so the next time you find yourself complaining,

477
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,780
bitching, moaning about rich people like Madonna,

478
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,780
adopting Malawi and children.

479
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,780
Please think about what's really going on in countries like that.

480
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,780
Countries like Somalia.

481
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,780
Countries like Darfur.

482
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,780
Think about the famine, the hunger, the peril that people are in.

483
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,780
And do something about that.

484
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,780
Complain about that, will you please?

485
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,780
Stop complaining about things that are just less important.

486
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,780
And I think a human life stands above all,

487
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,780
particularly on the mass scale.

488
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,780
And we're not seeing it.

489
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,780
Those of you, citizen journalists,

490
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,780
who claim to be citizen journalists,

491
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,780
please find something really important to talk about.

492
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,780
Talk about people dying on mass scale.

493
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,780
Go out and cover that.

494
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,780
Would you please?

495
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,780
A podcast, Paul, of course, excluded from this rat

496
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,780
because he's actually doing something about it.

497
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,780
And I'd have to say that would be it.

498
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,780
Sorry, I've been a little bit out of sorts today.

499
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,780
Ah, there you have it.

500
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,780
I'm ready for the weekend.

501
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,780
How about you?

502
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,780
Don't forget to send in those voice mail comments

503
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,780
plus one, two, one, sixty, five, six, three, five, seven.

504
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,780
Adam at podshow.com.

505
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,780
And of course, daily source code.com

506
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,780

507
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,780
in the show notes.

508
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,780
Have a great weekend, everybody.

509
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,780
I will talk to you on Monday.

510
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,780
Bye now.

511
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,780
Another podshow podcast.

512
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,780
Stick it in your ear.
