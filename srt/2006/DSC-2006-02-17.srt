1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta's Yeracharly 338, it's good to be back home.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm just a kid, I don't care.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Somebody told me you're a San Francisco.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Somebody told me that you're not on top of the world.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You probably walkin' down the street with your earbuds.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Champs so deep in your ear, yeah, you go and death.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You probably found this little MP3 for free.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We're looking play this, but not on the radio made this.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Just so I could let it go, there's anyone around here.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Still have a radio and anyone here at all.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Anyone here at all.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You should go and see a mountain cool bird seen.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's way cooler out there, yeah, I think so.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But maybe you just like it in your cozy little world.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You can play this, but not on the radio made this.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Just so I could let it go, there's anyone around here.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Still have a radio and anyone here at all.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Anyone here at all.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Maybe I'm just better won't you save me.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm from my hell.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Maybe I just like it if you turn it off now.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Turn it off now.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Forget about a sound wheeling West Virginia.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We can make it on our own.

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And we're doing just fine.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I can't afford your record, but it's out of sight.

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We can play this, but not on the radio made this.

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But not on the radio, hey now.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Switch off your radio, off your radio.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We can play this, but not on the radio made.

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Just so I could let it go, there's anyone around here.

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Still have a radio and anyone here at all.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Anyone here at all.

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Anyone here at all.

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's the Jeff Smith.

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Not on the radio.

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's Friday.

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
They come into you from Curry Cottage in Guilford.

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The affluent suburb of Surrey in the United Kingdom, just southwest of London.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Got in this morning from New York.

45
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Great trip, as always, as expected with Virgin upper class.

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I did something new this time.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000
They have a special sleeper section, which is basically the forward portion of the upper deck on a 747.

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's really nice, because the flight is only 6 hours.

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's like no nonsense and you even get where you check in and actually when you book the reservation.

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But especially when you check in, they say, do you understand what the sleeper cabin means?

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And basically no nonsense.

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You've got to shut up, you've got to just be quiet and go to sleep and you've got a night cabin.

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's it and then the wake up for breakfast if you want.

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And then actually put a little stamp on your ticket that says,

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What is it? Oh, I don't have the ticket anymore.

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Something like sleeper cabin has been explained to this passenger.

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I guess they need that so that they can tell you to shut up.

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So that was really nice actually.

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And it was, it was, um, what was your name, Liz?

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I think I think it was, yeah, Liz.

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Nice cottage last.

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And she woke me so nicely, so gently.

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's really weird because I really was asleep.

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And I was asleep on my back.

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Usually I'm a, I'm a side sleeper.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And I'm asleep on my back.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And then I just feel something on my leg.

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And it was, I don't know.

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I think I enjoyed it a little too much.

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Hey, Jeff Smith, who you heard with not on the radio.

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He's the guy behind.

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh, such a illustrious thing, such as, uh...

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Or...

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Or...

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Or...

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Sorry.

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Sorry.

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Got no Roger Smalls for you.

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Just wanted to play the jingle again.

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Um, you can find Jeff Smith at TheJefSmith.com.

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Hey, you know, um, last night before I went to bed, uh, or actually while I was in bed,

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and I was, uh, trying to unwind and I knew I had, uh,

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
the whole Thursday to do a couple things, which I'll talk about in a minute.

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I flipped on.

85
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I actually flipped through a couple of, uh, a couple of the late night talk shows.

86
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I just missed, um, John Stewart show, which bummed me out.

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I usually watch that every night, religiously in San Francisco.

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Um, so actually I tuned into Letterman.

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And of course he had some, you know, pretty funny, uh, Cheney jokes.

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Um, but I noticed something.

91
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Look at the microphone on his desk, which I presume, of course,

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
is, uh, it may be hooked up, but I don't think they actually, you know,

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
the way it's pointed doesn't seem like it would be a functional way for that

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
particular microphone to work, but look at it.

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Doesn't it look just like the Hile PR 40?

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Without the logo, but I mean, the structure, the, the way the,

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
the casing is built, it looks exactly like it.

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So the question is, hey, is it a PR 40 with the, uh, label removed?

99
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Um, is it a knockoff of the PR 40, just a prop?

100
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Or was the PR 40 modeled on that microphone, perhaps?

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I just thought it was interesting, then, just point that one out.

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Now about Dick Cheney.

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I know someone who knows Dick Cheney very well.

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Uh, in fact, I know someone who knows Donald Rums, Rumsfeld very well.

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Uh, Colin Powell very well.

106
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Uh, George H. Bush very very well.

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And this person is actually in my family.

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Uh, I know him is Uncle Don.

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I've always known him is Uncle Don.

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Um, you can Google him if you want.

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
His name is Donald P. Greg Golf Romeo Echo Golf Golf.

112
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Um, and he, so he's my uncle.

113
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He's married to my, uh, my father's sister.

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And I got a beautiful email from him, uh, on Wednesday as well.

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Wednesday evening.

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And he said, you know, um, and I really, I should have realized this.

117
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Um, that, you know, communicate.

118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Of course, there's been lots of communication by email and phone.

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Um, and he said, well, you know what?

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I can move some stuff around tomorrow.

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Uh, I was actually planning on seeing a carry-wise burger.

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Ice burger?

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Carry-wise burger?

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Ice burger?

125
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Ice?

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Ice?

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Ice?

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Ice?

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Ice?

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Ice?

131
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Ice?

132
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Ice?

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Ice?

134
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Ice?

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Ice?

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Ice?

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Ice?

138
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Ice?

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Ice?

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Ice?

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Ice?

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Ice?

143
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Ice?

144
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Ice?

145
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Ice?

146
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,480
And there you go, my uncle worked at the CIA for 31 years.

147
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,320
I believe he might have actually run it for a period of time.

148
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,960
Then he got heavily involved in Asian affairs.

149
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,680
He was in Vietnam for four years.

150
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,720
He was also the ambassador to South Korea for a couple of years.

151
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:26,720
And when George H 41, as we say, was vice president, Don was,

152
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,920
I know he's a personal advisor.

153
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,320
He was on the VPs personal staff.

154
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,720
I don't know if it was security advisor or, well,

155
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,520
we're going to find out because I am going to interview him

156
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,400
in the not too distant future.

157
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,880
Because he's just fascinating guy.

158
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
70, yet years old.

159
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,640
And currently, for a while, he's been the CEO of something called

160
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,760
the Korea Society.

161
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,000
And the Korea Society is a nonprofit.

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,520
And its entire purpose is to help Koreans

163
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,680
and Americans, North Koreans, as well, understand each other better.

164
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,160
He's also been in North Korea several times.

165
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,320
And he's met with the regime.

166
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,040
And he has been, I believe he's been instrumental in some

167
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,200
of the negotiations and the table of six,

168
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,160
or what are the meeting of six, whatever it's called.

169
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,240
So really, kind of stupid of me, not to have thought of

170
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,640
hooking up with him much, much earlier.

171
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,040
So I said, you know what, I'll drop by the office.

172
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,120
We had a great Korean lunch.

173
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,160
It was really weird because I walked in and everyone's like

174
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,760
Ambassador Greg and Ambassador Greg.

175
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,800
And I'm 41 still calling him Uncle Don.

176
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,440
Could help it.

177
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,240
And so, you know, we had some family conversation,

178
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,520
which was really nice, just have a nice lunch

179
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,320
and sit in this beautiful library surrounded by pictures of

180
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,040
presidents and him and all just fantastic artwork,

181
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,640
Korean, just literature, all kinds of stuff,

182
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,720
all over the place, really fascinating.

183
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,080
And we really started talking about politics, of course.

184
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,360
I mean, this is a guy when I used to stay at my cousin's house,

185
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,120
which, of course, you know, kids of the ambassador.

186
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,600
He had a red phone and it was literally like,

187
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,560
you pick that one up and you get the situation room.

188
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,560
I do remember picking it up once and hearing some,

189
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,440
and didn't, you know, I was just like,

190
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,680
I'll just pick it up and listen to the dial tone and immediately

191
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,560
it was like, you know, White House operator.

192
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,760
What's wrong with the Greg?

193
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,960
So I, you know, I said, you know, we just went on,

194
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,560
you know, he had so many, he has a lot of frustration

195
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,240
because he knows Korea so well.

196
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,560
And obviously North Korea being on the so-called

197
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,680
Axis of evil.

198
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,080
So he's a guy who's a Republican who is not at all happy,

199
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,360
not at all happy with 43.

200
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,120
George W. Bush, he's very, very vocal about it.

201
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,120
In fact, his Christmas card was, was a beautiful Christmas card

202
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:07,160
with a picture of Don, his wife, Meg, the Korean ambassador

203
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:13,560
and his wife, and 43, George 41, George H.

204
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,840
No, Barbara wasn't there.

205
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,080
And he had actually written on the picture, you know,

206
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,600
Merry Christmas, this is the good Bush.

207
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,120
And I believe some people were very upset and, you know, wrote

208
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,160
some other message on the card and sent it back to him.

209
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,200
But, you know, this so this guy's very, very politically minded

210
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,320
and very outspoken.

211
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,320
And I said, you know, but you know, you know, a whole bunch of these

212
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,520
guys in the regime and of course, the topic was Cheney and he said

213
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,520
something very interesting. He said, I do not recognize Cheney.

214
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,600
He says, this is not the guy that I work with.

215
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,880
He's 180 degrees, the opposite of the Cheney he knew.

216
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,040
And I thought that was pretty interesting.

217
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,800
But he has all kinds of just fascinating insight into what's going on in the

218
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,840
world and then he had a guest speaker in and he's caught me. He's slick.

219
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,400
You know, he's sitting with me for like an hour and a half and then

220
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,120
he goes and meets with his speaker and I introduce his name.

221
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,360
We're talking and then we walk right into the auditorium.

222
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,520
He goes right to the podium and introduces Ian Bremer, who's from

223
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,960
the Eurasia group, which is also very interesting.

224
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,360
This is another guy I want to introduce. I just want to introduce

225
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,320
some of these people because, you know, it's so the quality of information I

226
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,560
received and just an afternoon was so much better than any publication

227
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,440
or news program or just anything that I've been able to learn about

228
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,040
what's going on. And, you know, so of course we talked a little bit about

229
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,240
podcasting, which he had not heard of. And I said, look, you know, I had

230
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,800
really love to have you on the show and just ask you questions.

231
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,680
And he said that he would be delighted to, there's going to be stuff that's

232
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,880
off limits. I think I probably have to ask him first, you know, if there's

233
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,480
stuff I can't even ask about because, you know, throughout the years, I'm sure

234
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,240
as, you know, growing up in family, you know, you hear stuff that maybe

235
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:11,960
not, maybe isn't meant for, for rebroadcast, particularly in the

236
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,320
earlier agency years. But I'm really excited about that. So in the next,

237
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,920
I'd say in the next four weeks or so I'm going to try and make it happen.

238
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,480
I'm going to have the ambassador on the show. It'll be, I think you're really, really

239
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,080
enjoyed and he has great stories and he does accents when he does stories,

240
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:37,320
just a, he's a great storyteller. So that was, that really just perfected an

241
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:43,400
already perfect week, even though I was dead dead tired, just from running around

242
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,600
in the, in the snow in the city, it was very productive and it's good to be home.

243
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,840
Patricia is leaving in a couple hours. She's, as, as I think I told you, she's going to

244
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,400
rhododam to help her sister open up her accessories store.

245
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,840
And I don't know what it's, I should ask her what it's called. So anyway, she's

246
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,880
getting packed up and then Christina and I will be here for the weekend. Then on

247
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,680
Sunday, as Patricia is headed home, I'll be heading out to San

248
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,400
Fran for a week out on the west coast. Because, you know, there's some really

249
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,040
important stuff that has to be done. Like getting Trinity ready to be

250
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:28,040
pumped out. Let me see. Okay, let me see. I, I something I want to talk about,

251
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,840
but let's just, let's do some some audio stuff first. Okay, then we'll get to

252
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,920
go back out to Adam. It's got me from Geek Brief TV. Since the Charlie's

253
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,720
a testing ground for podcasting, I'm wondering if you'd be willing to

254
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,320
help me try something on the brief. Now, I know everyone's mind goes to a

255
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,080
slightly inappropriate place when they hear the term Double Ender. But for

256
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,120
people who don't know, a Double Ender is a technique where people in two

257
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,800
different places talk on SkyBrown Foam and each recorded conversation. The

258
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,400
two files are edited together, so you end up with audio quality equivalent to what

259
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,080
you'd get if both people were recording the same room. I want to do that with

260
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,800
video and I'd like the first experiment to be an interview with you. Here's how

261
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,040
it work. We set up a time for an eye chat and we have TV cameras rolling

262
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,320
on both sides. We do the interview. You send me your aunt and I'll

263
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,400
mash it up with mine. Mm, dirty. What do you think? Wanna give it a

264
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:27,000
try? Okay. How can I refuse and offer for a double ender with you?

265
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,400
Of course, I'd love to give it a try. I'm going to be in San Francisco. You know, we

266
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,800
could try the double ender between two rooms or something. You know, just in

267
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,720
case, you know, the distance is too great in the ass. If you haven't seen

268
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,640
Callie, you must see geekbrief.tv. Great gadgets, great presentation. It's

269
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,720
very consumable. It's short. It's fun. It's surprising. There's always

270
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:58,200
something else going on. And then, of course, there's, uh, there's Callie.

271
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Podcast listeners around the world. You're invited to party with Matthew

272
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:07,800
Evil. Thursday, February 23rd in Nashville, Tennessee. Join Matthew and

273
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,320
friends of the French Quarter Cafe to celebrate the release of his new

274
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,720
album, Beer and Coffee. It's an all-ages show. He'll take it

275
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,360
rice. No cover charge. And if you tell him you heard about it on this podcast,

276
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:25,160
you'll walk out of there with a free prize. I know you're

277
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,400
Thursday, February 23rd in Nashville, Tennessee. Matthew and his band will play the hits

278
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:42,360
from the new album, like wasting my time. I'll keep wasting my time again and the top

279
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:49,400
by rated song, Drive Away. Drive Away. The show starts at 830 p.m. Visit

280
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,480
www.matuevil.com for driving directions and more details.

281
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:04,440
Oh, man, we had some good talks over at a serious, uh, serious satellite radio

282
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,640
HQ about Podsafe music on the bird. Nothing firm that I can talk about yet, but

283
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,320
we had some really good conversations. And they're really kicking some

284
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,320
ass over there. It's every single time I go back to serious, there's more

285
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,480
shit, more paraphernalia rolling through the hallways, but it really

286
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,480
actually it has a very early 1980s MTV vibe to be, to be honest with you. And

287
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,680
that's just, you know, besides the fact that Steve leads a sitting in

288
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:36,120
office overseeing things, it really does have that vibe to it. And it's

289
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,560
cool, man. It really is. And it was, what a great trip. Great to hang out with P

290
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:47,560
dub as well. And he'll eat. So, um, I was reading in the financial times, I

291
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,880
believe it was probably Thursday's financial times, uh, but the reports were,

292
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:57,880
you know, all over the place that, um, now there are more pictures of Abu

293
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:05,160
gripe, uh, more pictures of detainees of, uh, apparent torture.

294
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,600
And, uh, these have been obtained out of the Freedom of Information Act, and the

295
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,040
government doesn't want them to be out because that'll cause unrest amongst

296
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,120
Muslims and blah, blah, blah, blah, and you know, I'm like, okay, uh, I

297
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,640
think that there is some process. As far as I know, there's some process

298
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,080
taking place. And, and of course, you never get to the people who may be

299
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,760
ultimately responsible, but people have been held to account for the

300
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,960
atrocities that took place in Abu gripe. To me, you know, and this comes

301
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,960
right back to the cartoons, and really the atrocity of, uh, of what the

302
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,160
mainstream media is really doing. And to be honest, how influenced

303
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,520
heavily by of all things, an episode of Boston Legal, um, James Spader, just

304
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,040
fantastic actor, but the writing on that show is very, very clever, and

305
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,520
and it does intertwine between reality and the twisted reality that is

306
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,720
the law firm that includes Captain Kirk. I mean, let's be honest, right?

307
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,640
And Candace Bergen, and we did have the lockler go, man. I was digging around the

308
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:13,640
show. If you really want to make a stir, and you really want to help in

309
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,400
the outrage that clearly there's outrage about the invasion of Iraq,

310
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,240
um, there's lots of confusion about what's going on, but, you know, in the

311
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,840
meantime, more than 2,000 soldiers, US soldiers have died. Over 300

312
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:41,240
British soldiers, I believe, uh, Italians, certainly one Dutchman. I'm not sure

313
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,520
about the Japanese, but they're also part of the quote coalition.

314
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:54,040
And during the Vietnam war, the media really brought that war home. And what they

315
00:20:54,040 --> 00:21:02,440
did was, they showed our young men and women dying on foreign soil. And it

316
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:08,280
caused an incredible outrage. And as I was thinking about this and that

317
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,920
Boston Legal episode influenced me and thinking about this whole cartoon

318
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,000
controversy. I'm like, you know, you want to be, you want to be a really big guy

319
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,640
and really publish something that's really going to get some attention and we'll

320
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,680
really get you in the news. Publish some pictures of dying marines,

321
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:30,600
GIs, mail, and female. Publish some of that. And, you know, and this is not, and this

322
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,000
is just, so I'm very clear, this is not out of disrespect for our service men and women

323
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,560
quite the opposite, quite the opposite. It's about time that they really got

324
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,640
respect for what's going on over there. And I feel that our media has not given them one

325
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,680
single ounce of respect. I mean, even the pictures of the coffins coming back,

326
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,920
drape with flags. Remember that? Those pictures had kind of been, they tried to

327
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:58,600
muffle those away as well, because it's not good from morale. Come on, media, do your

328
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:08,200
fucking job. Please excuse me, excuse my French. I hope that we can start a conversation

329
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,760
about this, because, you know, now that I've been back in the States for a week again,

330
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,600
I'm really thinking, where is it? Where are the pictures that will actually cause outrage?

331
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:23,320
That will actually start a real conversation. And this kind of comes back to the, to the White

332
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,880
House as well. You know, this whole chainy thing with, you know, trying to hide from the media,

333
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,440
trying to cover up the story. Look, this is what what's happened. These guys are just like the

334
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,560
Danny came movie are referred to, at least once a quarter, where they're writing the book of music

335
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:42,520
and they sit in some university basement for 10 years writing this book. And by the time they

336
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:49,240
come out, jazz has happened and has, has evolved. And, you know, they've completely only written

337
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,840
maybe one quarter of the entire book of music. So too, with this, with this, with this administration,

338
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,480
who've been in office during an entire internet revolution, yeah, Al Gore invented it and all that

339
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:05,320
shit. But broadband has come really come home. The tools are there. We're creating. We're able to

340
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:11,320
communicate very fast, very efficiently with each other. And these guys just don't know what happened.

341
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,440
They're still doing it the old way. They're not even trying to cover anything up. But the old way

342
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,480
was, you know, hey, we got to, you know, draw the wagons in a circle. Let's come up with how we're

343
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,640
and by the way, Uncle Don has some shit to say about this as well. Draw everything in a circle,

344
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,960
get everything, you know, completely positioned and do it all the right way. These guys can't

345
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:37,640
deal with the speed of communication, the speed, which, which the constituency is living at,

346
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,920
that's what's going on. That's why their PR nightmares continuously, because they're still trying

347
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,240
to do it the old way. It doesn't work anymore. It does not work.

348
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,520
Hey, man, that feels good to do that on a Friday. Hey, pretty soon in about two weeks, we'll be

349
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:00,200
moving to channel 102 on serious. Currently, you're probably listening to the daily source code on

350
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:06,040
serious stars 103. Glad to have you. If you really want to know what all the cool, uh, if you really

351
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,760
want to hear all the cool stuff, then you have to check out some of these podcasts. Go to a podcast

352
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:17,800
dialie.com, go to podshow.com or any podder.org or podcastpickle.com. You could check that out as well.

353
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,880
For you guys in about five seconds, uh, Mark Yoshimaru Nemkov will come on with a

354
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:32,120
Pacific Coast highway and after that the illustrious match Weinstein, and back on the podcast here.

355
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:39,560
I have a, a Gmail inbound Gmail from Hank Garner. And I thought was a good question, a fair

356
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,520
question. Adam, I'm a devout listener. I have a question for you. Does your daughter know about your

357
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:51,640
quote, recreation? Just wondering, Hank Garner? Hank, yes, she does. Talking about the recreation.

358
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:58,760
Remember now, I grew up in the Netherlands. I moved there when I was seven years old and

359
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,560
very interesting country. It has changed quite a bit since, uh, since I live there, at least the

360
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:10,200
first time around. Um, but there was, and it always has been in the Netherlands, um, culturally

361
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:16,440
completely accepted. If you want to smoke a plant, that's your business. And it's not a process

362
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:23,800
plant. It's just a plant. In fact, it's a, it's a, it's a weed. It grows just like a weed. Uh, so to are the

363
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:29,800
drinking laws very supple in the Netherlands. Um, certainly when I was a child, if you were sick, if you,

364
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:36,120
if you, at least look 16, you could walk into any bar and have a beer. And it really, none of these

365
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:44,200
things were a big, big prostitution similar, um, regulated, um, kept under wraps, um, prostitutes

366
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:49,240
plate, pay taxes, they have regular health checkups. This two has changed somewhat in the years.

367
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:55,320
But because it was there and opened, it's no big deal. And nudity, I remember watching, uh,

368
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,920
comedic shows that would come on at 730 in the evening and, uh, and they would be naked women

369
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:06,920
walking around and either for humorous purposes or whatever, but uh, there's no shame for the naked

370
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:13,240
body, uh, in the Netherlands. And that, that two has changed a little bit. Um, but that's the environment

371
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,480
that I grew up in. And so all these things were just not considered a big deal. And guess what,

372
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:24,840
if it's not a big deal, then it's not a big deal to have to try these things to an excess. Now,

373
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:30,200
what they did do in the Netherlands is made driving very difficult. Most people will not get their

374
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,800
license on the first go around probably two or three times that you'll have to take the exam before

375
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:41,560
you actually pass. I think that's pretty smart. If you take the combination of all those things and

376
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:46,200
also, you know, they really need less cars on the road and such a such a pimple of a country.

377
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:54,680
Um, so I, uh, this is, this is it within my DNA that it's just not a big deal.

378
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:02,600
And, um, when Christina was growing up in the US, she certainly did not, uh, know about any recreation,

379
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,600
uh, for the simple reason that I wouldn't want her speaking of it, uh, at school because in the

380
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:15,880
US, they would probably come and throw my ass in jail. I was really worried about that. Really.

381
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:22,600
Um, so, um, but, um, no, she knows what it is. Of course she knows what it is. She's 15.

382
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,480
She goes to public schools. She knows what everything is. Believe me. But it's no big deal. And she

383
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,440
doesn't care. And she doesn't, um, she doesn't want to use it herself. She doesn't want to smoke.

384
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:39,240
She doesn't smoke cigarettes. Uh, she doesn't drink. Um, and I think it's all just because it's

385
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,320
no big deal. And if she wants to, then, uh, she knows where she can get a drink. Or if she wants

386
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,360
something else, she knows where she can get that. She doesn't have to do that outside. So that's

387
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:52,680
our vision on parenting. And I have to say we're really, really proud of this kid that we've, uh,

388
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:59,000
we've produced and put on earth. We really are. What's this? Oh, yes. Oh, no. The

389
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:07,240
cinema playground screens. I was a movie. Hey Adam, Jim from the cinema playground.

390
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,960
I do. In honor of our one-year anniversary and our hundreds show, I have a new test for you

391
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,600
in your daily source code listeners. I'll play three movie clips. You guess the movie.

392
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:23,880
Okay. It might be a tumor. It's not a tumor. Uh, the Schwarzenegger.

393
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:31,480
Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Oh, and in case I don't see you,

394
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,080
good afternoon, good evening. Jim, uh, do you carry in the Truman Show?

395
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,080
That one I know.

396
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:46,760
The sportos and motorhips, geeks, sluts, bluts, waste oils. Do we be the kids? They all adore it.

397
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:52,200
They think he's a righteous dude. Classic. Isn't that the principle from Ferris Bueller's Day off?

398
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,800
Here they are one more time before giving you the answers. Give yourself extra credit for

399
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:03,400
knowing the year and the actor of the movie. All right. Might be a tumor. It's not a tumor.

400
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,760
From kindergarten and our star Arnold Schwarzenegger from 1989.

401
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,240
Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Oh, and in case I don't see you,

402
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,640
good afternoon, good evening and good night. Jim, carry in the 1998 film The Truman Show.

403
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:32,360
Sportos and motorhips, geeks, sluts, bluts, waste oils. Do we be the kids? They all adore it.

404
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,960
They think he's a righteous dude.

405
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,440
In 1986, 80 McClurg and Ferris Bueller's Day off.

406
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,960
Wait, I deserve a boring day off. Thanks for playing. Your feedback is appreciated.

407
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,080
Feedback at cinemaplayground.com. We'll talk to you soon.

408
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,320
Please remember to replace the speaker on the post when you leave the theater.

409
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,560
Visit the cinemaplayground at cinemaplayground.com.

410
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:09,800
Very cool. Congratulations on 100 episodes. There's a lot of those that have popped up recently. Very cool.

411
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,640
This is not good at this. You actually pulled some movies that I have seen. And of course Ferris Bueller's

412
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,520
Day off is such a classic and it was hard not to recognize Schwarzenegger. The boy,

413
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,440
do I miss those hit tests? Oh, I wish we could do hit tests again. Really?

414
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,960
Hey, Adam, this is Tokyo Jo from the newly released Made in Japan podcast.

415
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,800
Hey, TJ. I just wanted to come in briefly and a couple of things that came up in Delta,

416
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:39,000
Sarah, Charlie, 335. I see that Howard Stern has received some interest again from some

417
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,800
of your listeners. And I was reminded of his thoughts or I lacked their love about podcasting when

418
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:52,280
you're first talking about him a few months ago. So I decided to take a look at what podcast

419
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:59,080
Ali is showing for statistics. And I see that as of today, there's 14,627 podcasts listed on podcast

420
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:06,120
Ali. Now, it's thinking at each of them averages 100 listeners. Now, I know that not every podcast has

421
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:12,360
100 listeners, but if you consider the DSC and Don and Drew probably make up for quite a bit of us who

422
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:20,120
don't have the 100 listeners on average as yet. 14,627 podcasts times 100 listeners is 1.5 million

423
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,000
listeners. Now, in the end, that may not be many just yet. But I think the important point of

424
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,120
all this is that that's 100 or sorry, 1.5 million listeners listening from around the world.

425
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,400
I've liked and I've listened a stern for a number of years when I was in the States,

426
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,400
but on terrestrial radio or satellite radio, I can't hear them at all here in Tokyo, obviously.

427
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,560
And you know, from that perspective, isn't one reason that podcasting is better than radio,

428
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:50,680
it's simply because it's reach that can go around the world. And secondly, and briefly,

429
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:55,400
this whole thing on advertising, you know, I heard the the communal earthling idea yesterday,

430
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:01,160
I think it's great. But like some I said, also on the PSA's podcast, the impact of the

431
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:06,920
burp in the Sinsayo comment, it's hit me like a ton of bricks. And I'm so in tune with the burping

432
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,880
idea that anytime someone around me burps, I fall off with the Sinsayo, I actually board it out.

433
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,160
And now all of my Japanese colleagues and friends, I'm sure they think I'm nuts,

434
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:22,200
because you know, Sinsayo's not here and none of them have it, of course. Anyway, association

435
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,840
advertising for my perspective really works. I don't care if you burp or fart at him,

436
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,800
don't matter at all. This stuff really has my attention. I think it's something worth pursuing.

437
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:37,560
Hey, keep it up, Adam, and thanks. All right, man. So two things, first of all, I think there are

438
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,280
some podcasts of stirring around. And I believe that there's like a daily one minute or something that's

439
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:49,000
uh, I had a meeting with Jennifer Betcat at serious. She's a formerly of AOL and she's actually got a pretty

440
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:56,040
difficult task of integrating their website into their programming, which, of course, is not necessarily

441
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:03,560
in the DNA like it is with podcasting, not of broadcasters. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

442
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:14,360
comic strip, a blogger. Guess what, dude? Your wish is my command. Jennifer has promised me

443
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:21,160
that the serious pod shows will be streaming. It's coming, my brother. It's coming.

444
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,000
Now, regarding the earth link and advertising, yeah, the sound advertising, of course,

445
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,120
was a tremendous experiment and I'm very happy with it. I can't even deprogram people. In

446
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,880
fact, when I tried that, I got lots of people angry about the whole burping thing just by itself.

447
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,840
So it is kind of limited in scope, because I don't have that many more bodily noises that I can

448
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,800
that I'm guaranteed will show up within each, you know, within a half hour, basically, in any given

449
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:52,040
half hour, and recording the show. So it's what somewhat limited in scope. Now, I'm a little disappointed

450
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:58,120
for all the noise, all the pushback, all the the the flames and the ranting about the earth link

451
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:03,720
advertising. So here we are. A Tuesday, I have a strategy, a strategy meeting.

452
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:12,600
Thank God, it's not a steering committee, but we have a strategy meeting about the next earth link

453
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:18,200
campaign. And this is going to be user generated. So, you know, now I've heard from lots of people,

454
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,200
but all the people who yelled the loudest haven't come up with any really creative ideas,

455
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,840
and I'd really like to hear from you because here's the opportunity. You know, you get the

456
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:33,080
determined, how you want it to happen. So, you know, it's real easy to slag it, but now let's

457
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:38,200
come up with some creative stuff, looking forward to it. I got plenty of ideas. I'm just very curious

458
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,680
to see if some of the loud mouths have ideas. Hey, Happy, what are you doing? I'm about to jump

459
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:49,080
on the information super highway in that old plunker. You got a better idea? Sure, do.

460
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,640
First one. What can earth link give me that? I don't have here already. Earth link can give

461
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:58,200
you an internet safe from viruses and scammers. Earth link can keep your personal information

462
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:03,960
personal with free antivirus software of firewall and a spyware blocker. But I want to get on the

463
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,960
information super highway. Come on, get in. Earth link has high speed options that really need.
