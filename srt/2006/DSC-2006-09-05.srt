You want the breeze?

65
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,160
No, just because

66
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,160
It's on low and you know what I know

67
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,160
This my present is worrying

68
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,160
Should you tell her yeah?

69
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,160
No, I guess yesterday

70
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,160
Oh, okay

71
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Yeah

72
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,160
I have the portable refrigerator

73
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,160
Yeah, it's cool. But I've got to move it a turn it off

74
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
Yeah

75
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
We're kind of excited here

76
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:39,640
at the cottage because we're yet again we're in the game. We are we are jumping in and

77
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:45,680
just barely clinging on to the lowest rung of the property ladder by our fingernails.

78
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,640
Yes. We're trying to hop on the property ladder. Yes. Yes. So we've we've made an offer and I tried

79
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,720
something different. Did you notice I tried something different this time? I just said, what's

80
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,640
the asking price? Okay, that's my offer. I mean, what difference does it make? I don't want

81
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,040
to wait around anymore. So we saw a place yesterday. We drove around the town. It's

82
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,640
about 15 minutes from Gilford. Yeah. It's technically is Gilford, actually. Yes. It's the

83
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:19,560
council. We're all, we're all, we're all, we're all of Gilford. Yeah. We liked it very much.

84
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,280
We've been looking at the picture for over a week because we couldn't get an appointment to

85
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,000
go and see it. Yeah, that was actually amazing. What? Well, we called. Oh, yeah. This

86
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,440
is on vacation. It's a lady who handles this. It's on holiday. On the holiday. So we

87
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:40,040
have to just wait for a week. Can you imagine that is that is a British or what? I guess.

88
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,960
Okay. It's not very good. It could be almost Jamaica. Yeah, really. Next week, man. It's

89
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,920
our iri. Yeah. Not a problem. Yeah. I mean, happy if somebody is calling for your house

90
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:57,480
no, just wait for a week. Yeah. Okay. We're not in hurry. Right. So, but I think it's perfect.

91
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:04,760
There were so many signs yesterday that this house was perfect for us. It started with there

92
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:11,240
was a, that was the little statue outside. Yeah, the little lady that I used to have in my

93
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:19,520
bathroom. Yes, that our housekeeper broke. Yeah, with her butt. Yes. Her scrunchies, scrunched

94
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:25,760
used butt. Yeah. And so she had the exact same thing. It's more like a bust, isn't it?

95
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,680
It's a bust of a beautiful lady that actually, it's almost like she's holding a towel around

96
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,760
her. Yeah. Very chic. A very beautiful beautiful. And it was the exact same one. It was the

105
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,960
Uh, today we're done at 230. What was that all about? We're glad they're gone. So why?

106
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,600
Why she done at 230? I don't know. Because it's the first day and um, and it's it would

107
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,680
don't want too much stress on the kids. I do remember I do remember going back to school

108
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,520
that first day is like, oh, oh, you could put them in just and it took forever. I know that.

109
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:58,880
But um, now can I walk with with Liz home and then she will be home on time? Okay. But

110
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,040
so she doesn't need anybody to pick her up. So back to the house. Okay, back to the house.

111
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,880
Back to the house. Uh, so there was this statue. It was the lady, actually.

112
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,960
Call it to say that her offer had been accepted. Yes. Yeah. Good luck. Well,

113
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,400
she said it was accepted for 50% already. Well, that means crap. That means that means

114
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,600
completely nothing. Well, she was very happy. Well, wait a minute. Let's talk about the rest of the house first.

115
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay. You want to talk about just the other signs that we saw. Oh, yeah. So, so we saw that lady.

116
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,200
Yeah. Okay. I'll move down from that. And uh, the kitchen. That was one sign. The kitchen was good.

117
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,640
There were, oh, so in her kitchen, it was filled with Dutch Delft Blue Croquery.

118
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:45,840
Thanks. Yeah. Coquery. Yeah. Delft Blue Birds. Yes. Sports. Yes. Plates and salt pepper

119
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:52,000
shakers and her, her son and I think was working at Mike's bike tours in Amsterdam. Yeah.

120
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Sound like a real winner this boy. Right. What she was really nice. She was like 60 in a yoga instructor.

121
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,920
Yeah. Yeah. And then we went upstairs and they started opening up. She said, you go ahead and

122
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,840
she took us through a little tour and then said, now I'll go and sit in the garden. You can do whatever you want.

123
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,960
Yeah. And you can talk about it without me. Right. So I'm opening up the cabinets and the

124
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,680
closets in the hallway and I opened up the linen closet and I was like, I was floored. I was like,

125
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:23,120
oh my gosh. It is exactly exactly like your linen closet, which let me just detail for you. Yes.

126
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,520
Every single piece of linen should be folded properly with the round edge, the folded edge facing

127
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:36,240
outward. Just in the shop, just like in the shop. Yeah. And she even had her sheets and towels

128
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,760
and things all tagged with little pieces of paper. It's just like you. Yeah. And it had the same kind of

129
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:48,560
nice warm, whafting, lightly perfume, soapy stuff. Because I put pieces of soap in between them,

130
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,720
just like my grandmother did. Unbelievable. I said, yeah. And towels also. Yeah. We had brown

131
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,720
rounded side out. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Fantastic. So. So I said, oh my god. That's my closet.

132
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:07,200
And what's really cool about it is, if I fly, uh, it's close. It's actually pretty close to

133
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,440
uh, to Fair Oaks. Yeah. It's about the same distance. No. Yeah. But maybe even a little bit shorter

134
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,840
because we're closer to them 25. Uh, but if I were to, you know, usually when we come in from big

135
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,280
and hill, then we go to Arkham, which is an unused airfield, which has a beacon on it. This is,

136
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,760
like, I don't know, maybe four or five miles from that actual beacon. Don't, you don't have to

137
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,440
go all freaky. I'm not going to tell anyone where the fuck it is. Okay. I see going twitching.

138
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,400
How do you think of stupid? That's what you get. Okay. So let's talk about this for a second. So

139
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,760
I told you that this, um, gossip TV show, listen, uh, in Holland. They call it show news. Yeah.

140
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,720
It's sort of entertainment tonight. No. It's, it's, no. It's not entertainment tonight. They wish it

141
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,520
was entertainment tonight. Correct. It's fucking crazy. Do not, I mean, that's no way. Mary Hart would

142
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,560
turn over in her grave. She's not even dead yet. She's not even dead yet. John Tash. I guess.

143
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,400
But, you know, so then they report on the whole Liam thing, which is to be expected, except. And

144
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,440
now, I want to say I still have not heard what they actually said. I've only heard it's second hand

145
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,120
from you from your mom, which I have to be honest, gives me a degree of accuracy of about 40%.

146
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,080
Well, I, you know, it was very easy to check that because I never told her anything.

147
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,120
Has nothing to do with that. It's just to do with the way your mom relates what she sees and

148
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,880
hears on television. Well, the information was enough. The way they said it, I don't care.

149
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,760
Yet that makes all the difference. But, you know, so now Patricia's like, we'll see now we can't

150
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,600
do. We can't talk about anything fun because of course they're going to use it on the air.

151
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,760
And I thought about this because we had a pretty heated debate about this. And I thought about it.

152
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:48,560
I said, you know, actually, you, you, it's your obligation to the independence of free media

153
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:58,080
and, and, and our comrades side by side, using mainstream media to further our cause

154
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,200
because it's only promotion. People are going to say, oh, that's interesting. They don't give

155
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,960
a shit about what they said. They're going to come and listen to the source to the real show.

156
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,440
Did they, I, I'm pissed because they didn't say daily source code dot com. That's what I'm pissed about.

157
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,520
But not about anything else. No. So, what, what I mean is see if I'm talking, you know, right now.

158
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,320
No, you're totally restrictive. You're stuck with today. I'm saying, no, no, no, no.

159
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,560
You feel like you can't say it. No, no, when I'm talking right now, I say the way I say it,

160
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,440
then I've said it. You know, that's okay. But that's the way I want to say it. Right. But

161
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,920
if Dutch people translated and do it in a certain way because it sells so much better if you say it in

162
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,840
different way. If you don't, yes, it gets and it becomes a different story. And that's what I hate.

163
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:53,440
Okay. If they would, if they, if they, for example, could hear us or let them hear us in the show,

164
00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:00,160
the way we say it and we, the way we tell our stories, I wouldn't even mind. Can I just say something

165
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,120
until I, but I hate the way they, but I didn't hear the actual reports. So I don't know what they

166
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,400
twisted. And you know what, your mom already translated their translated version to her,

167
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,200
her language, which is a whole different thing altogether. And then it came to you. You didn't,

168
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,880
I mean, how many times is your mom said something? We went like, huh? Remember, it was like

169
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,840
Julie London. Julie London is dead. Because I can't stand it. You haven't gotten like what,

170
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,400
you don't know what really said. It's free because I know them and they always twist and turn

171
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:36,160
everything. So it sounds differently and it sounds more dramatic. Well, of course, you read the

172
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,760
fucking song every single day. You think that's not the same thing. I think about that. I know.

173
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:47,440
But, but I see, I'm like, wow, that's great. We made, we made this fucking stupid TV show.

174
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,360
I'm pissed off. They didn't tell people where they can go and listen to it because it's just more

175
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,200
listeners. Isn't that what it's about? Is it about growing the audience and and showing that you

176
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,520
can do different things? Well, they get the information for fuck them and fuck them. But you know

177
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,840
that normally when they call, we don't even answer. Because I know that. We actually don't want to be

178
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,640
in that show. If you answered, maybe they wouldn't take stuff from our show.

179
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,960
I don't want to answer. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. I didn't even know this was

180
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:21,760
interesting. Did you? Are you kidding me? Wow, I wasn't thinking about it. Well, people like it.

181
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,800
This is what I keep telling you. People listen to the show. They like it. They think it's,

182
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,320
this Liam thing has been amazing. I don't even shit about the Dutch. Listen to this.

183
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,360
What is poor one? How poor Liam? No, no. No, no. He's going to be okay. Listen to this.

184
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
We're alone.

185
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Obviously, I said daughter, daughter,

186
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
obviously she's a lot.

187
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,800
She always likes daughter.

188
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
You're daughter.

189
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
Her daughter, I said,

190
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
God, she's,

191
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
please, have alone.

192
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
She's, she's, she's looking guy.

193
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
You know,

194
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
second, secondly,

195
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
42, 42, as big.

196
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
Okay, so that was about the beginning.

197
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Please,

198
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
I'm alone.

199
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
Leave from alone.

200
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
So, now the message,

201
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
I told you the Dan,

202
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
uh,

203
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Dan played,

204
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,800
and of course,

205
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Dan's a real nice guy.

206
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
Yeah.

207
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
He played like little pieces of it.

208
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
Dan is another friend.

209
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Did he, I don't know if he played the whole show for,

210
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
uh, for Liam or not.

211
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
And Liam got really freaking out.

212
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
Yeah, because he,

213
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Liam said, I want to,

214
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
I want to listen to it myself,

215
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,800
you know,

216
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
but what did they really say?

217
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
Right.

218
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
And Dan said,

219
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Oh, good.

220
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
So he, um,

221
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
he played us for him.

222
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
And he was,

223
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
he was freaking out.

224
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
But what he doesn't get

225
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,800
is that.

226
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
The same thing that Dutch journalist don't get.

227
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,800
Yeah, don't, don't.

228
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
Fucking show business.

229
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,800
We're having fun here.

230
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
Come on.

231
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
We, we don't go on here.

232
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,800
I mean,

233
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
but we don't exaggerate.

234
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,800
It's a real story.

235
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Absolutely.

236
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
It's the real story.

237
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
So the only thing he has to do is grow some hair

238
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
and get some new pants.

239
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,800
He doesn't understand our,

240
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,800
your way of talking probably.

241
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,800
You know, he thinks he,

242
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
he takes it very seriously.

243
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Well, you may be starving.

244
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,800
If you don't know us,

245
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
you know,

246
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
it scares the hell out of you.

247
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
I don't know.

248
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Yeah.

249
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
Because all the parents doesn't,

250
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
they don't talk like we do.

251
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
No.

252
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
No.

253
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Really?

254
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
Yeah.

255
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Guess you're right.

256
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
Guess you're right.

257
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,800
We are too old.

258
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Poor Liam.

259
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
Show is farce.

260
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
So.

261
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
But so now Christina said he might be going back to university

262
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
instead of going joining the RAF.

263
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,800
I don't know.

264
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
I don't know.

265
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,800
Excuse me.

266
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,800
That's what it does to me.

267
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Yeah.

268
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
It doesn't mean sense.

269
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,800
Yeah.

270
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
You, you get,

271
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,800
um,

272
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,800
acid reflux from.

273
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,800
Oh.

274
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Boyfriend reflux.

275
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
Boyfriend reflux.

276
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Oh.

277
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Oh.

278
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Oh, you see what this guy had to say.

279
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
It's a month.

280
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
About 42 is a special number.

281
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Number.

282
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Uh, absolutely my favorite number.

283
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,800
And I don't know it.

284
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Almost every single thing.

285
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
She's going to link to number 42.

286
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
She desired.

287
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,800
I don't know why.

288
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Any of these.

289
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
Um, also also.

290
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Uh, do you know any good podcast and volume grid locks?

291
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
Uh,

292
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
No.

293
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
What was the 42?

294
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Oh, we were talking about.

295
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Because I, because I turned 42.

296
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Oh, yeah.

297
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
At 42 seems to be a really magical number.

298
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
There's your number.

299
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
Yeah.

300
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
Yeah.

301
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Yeah.

302
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Something else about it.

303
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
What was up here it is.

304
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,800
Uh, yeah.

305
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Listen to this one.

306
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
So this, that hitchhikers guide to the galaxy.

307
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
Yeah.

308
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Which is a book and an audio book and a movie, which is very successful.

309
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
There, um,

310
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,800
you know, the master says the answer to all things in the universe is 42.

311
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Oh.

312
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Yeah.

313
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
Here's why.

314
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
Hi Adam.

315
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
It's cool for out here again from Somerset.

316
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,800
Um, I just thought, you know, 42 related piece of information.

317
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Um, not many people know that.

318
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Um, the reason that that was Adam shows the number 42 is to being the answer to everything.

319
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,800
Is because he was very fond of blend 32.

320
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
T from parents.

321
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Blend 32.

322
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
But then 32.

323
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Blend 42.

324
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Um, and so when he was looking for an ultimate answer.

325
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
He's ultimate answer to things in the cup of tea.

326
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,800
So, uh, the ultimate answer was obviously 42.

327
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,800
Um, a little bit trivia.

328
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,800
Uh, happy birthday for the other day.

329
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
And also, too soon.

330
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Oh, yeah.

331
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
It's gone.

332
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Yeah, of course.

333
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Oh.

334
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Yeah.

335
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
That's funny.

336
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
Yeah.

337
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
So we should try here is Sarah's blend 42.

338
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Oh.

339
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
It's the answer to it.

340
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,800
And I must say for the, for the, for the bridge, the, a cup of tea really is the answer to a lot, isn't it?

341
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Yeah.

342
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,800
Don't you think?

343
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
Yeah.

344
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
I hear that everywhere.

345
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Yeah.

346
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
I just do.

347
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
And I know it.

348
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,800
I've just miscarried.

349
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
Let's put a kettle on.

350
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
Let's have a cup of tea.

351
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
I don't just been hit by a song.

352
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
I think I'm dying.

353
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Oh, let's have a cup of tea.

354
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Put a kettle on.

355
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Time to put a kettle on.

356
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
Yeah, right.

357
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
Yeah.

358
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,800
So it looks like, um, the 13th of September.

359
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,800
We have our, uh, we have a big announcement coming up here in, uh, in the UK pod.

360
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
So UK.

361
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
Oh, yeah.

362
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
So I'm going to stay until then.

363
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
I think Ron's coming over.

364
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
Nice.

365
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
And then that's not sure yet.

366
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,800
But that we're going to find out today.

367
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,800
And then after that, I'm going to go back to San Francisco for a couple of weeks, two weeks, probably.

368
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
Really?

369
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
Yeah.

370
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Well, how long have I been here with you?

371
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
I mean, too long.

372
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
I hope.

373
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
How tired are you of me?

374
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
I'm going to get the fuck out, right?

375
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
You're like, can't hear him out of here.

376
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Oh, God.

377
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
Please.

378
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,800
So I can have a, a, a decent night's sleep.

379
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Sleep.

380
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
How about the other day when I was an answer day when I stayed overnight?

381
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,800
I slept like a bed.

382
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800
I don't know what it is.

383
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,800
I can tell you, you know, we need to get a place that has my own bedroom.

384
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
We don't have that in this new place.

385
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,800
You turn off your brains and sleep like you're in a coma.

386
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,800
But it's like, almost, I get everything.

387
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
It's almost you give it to me.

388
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Maybe you should lay a little bit further away.

389
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
We need bigger bed.

390
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Or like, a bigger bed is a pretty big bed.

391
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
Yeah.

392
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
I know.

393
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
I'm about a piece of lead between, between our heads.

394
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
So the, no brain.

395
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
So whoa.

396
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,800
So have you seen my mom yet in your dream?

397
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
No.

398
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Because that's usually been dropped by.

399
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Every being, every living being that, that passes humanoid.

400
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,800
It says good morning or whatever drops by Patricia's dream.

401
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Yeah.

402
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
And it's.

403
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,800
They shoot, they shoot, they should say goodbye.

404
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,800
You know, on a certain level, they, they come and say goodbye.

405
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
So that you can let go.

406
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,800
How long does that take typically before that happens?

407
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,800
Well, it doesn't, I don't know actually.

408
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
Sometimes it goes real fast.

409
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,800
And I think it depends on the person that they don't want to leave yet.

410
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,800
If they struggle.

411
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,800
That's my mom.

412
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
Yeah.

413
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,800
I'm thinking she wanted to know.

414
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
No.

415
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,800
So there's so many things she wants to do probably.

416
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,800
So when we spread my mom's ashes at a whole calm.

417
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
It was a group conversation.

418
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,800
And Willow said, you know, mom promised me a sign.

419
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
Yeah.

420
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,800
And she said, you know, because my mom, our mom, got a sign.

421
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
It was promised a sign from Whiffy.

422
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
Yeah.

423
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
My grandmother, our grandmother, which he never got.

424
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
That's what she thinks.

425
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Exactly.

426
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
And so Willow's like, I want a sign.

427
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,800
It has to be something really good.

428
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,800
It's, well, you know, maybe you have to define what that sign should be.

429
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,800
Yeah.

430
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,800
Exactly.

431
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
Because it comes in two ends, right?

432
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Things happen.

433
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
And, and you know, why they happen?

434
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,800
And you never think that that's the sign.

435
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,800
You know, so Tiffany and her boyfriend.

436
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
Yeah.

437
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
We're on the beach in central pay.

438
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
They went away for a couple days.

439
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
Yeah.

440
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,800
And they're on the beach in central pay.

441
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
And a huge butterfly.

442
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
I'm showing you how big it is.

443
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
Oh, my God.

444
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Right.

445
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Settle down on the beach on the sand in between them for about a minute.

446
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
And then flew off into the distance.

447
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
So they thought that was a sign.

448
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Yeah.

449
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,800
And Willow's like, that's not going to be enough.

450
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:05,800
She's like, I want the book to fall open to a page that has something in there that

451
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
Mom would have said.

452
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
Okay.

453
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
And like, oh, okay.

454
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
See, that's better.

455
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
That's a better definition of what the sign should be.

456
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Yeah.

457
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,800
But sometimes you are somewhere in something drops behind you or something moves.

458
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
And you think, oh, it's the wind.

459
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
Oh, it's this.

460
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
Oh, it's the cat.

461
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,800
You don't know that.

462
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
Right.

463
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Yeah.

464
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
I've gotten so much.

465
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Because if you think something, if you see something really special,

466
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
you probably don't believe it.

467
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,800
I've gotten so many voice males and emails from people who see butterflies and have to

468
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,800
think of my mom now that I've programmed everyone to do that.

469
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,800
It's really cool.

470
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,800
The butterfly.

471
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Yeah.

472
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
One day I'm going to do a whole butterfly tribute and play all the stuff that everyone

473
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
is sent to me.

474
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Now, I call it the butterfly.

475
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
The butterfly.

476
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Yeah.

477
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
The butterfly.

478
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
Instead of the butterfly.

479
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,800
So anyway, so we put the off in on the house.

480
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Yep.

481
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
And then the Linda.

482
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
Linda.

483
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
It's Linda.

484
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
It's Linda.

485
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Hello.

486
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
It's Linda.

487
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
The real estate.

488
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,800
We'll call us back today.

489
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
Yeah.

490
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
She said, well, she was, what was she?

491
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
She was.

492
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
What?

493
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
She was nervous all of a sudden, though.

494
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
Well, the lady was actually in shock.

495
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
She was in shock.

496
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
And she's been on the market for a couple of months.

497
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,800
I have to discuss this with somebody.

498
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,800
Yeah, she's a winner.

499
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
I'm going to do this.

500
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
And how quickly I have to do this because we're in a hurry.

501
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Yeah.

502
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Yeah.

503
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,800
So she has to check if the people.

504
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
So the people who.

505
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,800
She's going to buy the the cottages.

506
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,800
She's going to move in for now.

507
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
And then after that, she's going to travel to France.

508
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,800
But if she's buying a cottage, I thought she was going to rent it.

509
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,800
If she's buying it.

510
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
Or rent it.

511
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Then we're in a chain.

512
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
Did you hear?

513
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
I thought she said rent.

514
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Oh, rent.

515
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Because it was buying.

516
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Then we're in a chain.

517
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
That would be not great.

518
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
She's not in a chain.

519
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
The cottage's already empty.

520
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
But she needs to find the people.

521
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,800
So I think she's checking everything if she can really do it.

522
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,800
So we're still leaving in about 10 minutes to go look at some other houses.

523
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
Yeah.

524
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
We've got to be there.

525
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,800
We're in Woke.

526
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
A two.

527
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
Crap man.

528
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
It's one thirty four.

529
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,800
You're going to call.

530
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
I'm going to call.

531
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Is that Helen who we're going to see?

532
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
No.

533
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
It's Helen's calling.

534
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Yeah.

535
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Maggie.

536
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
Yes.

537
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
Maggie.

538
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
Maggie.

539
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Graham in Norfolk.

540
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
You wanted some feedback on profiles.

541
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
I've got some feedback on a profile.

542
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,800
This is a guy who sent in who he is.

543
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
Listener.

544
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
Really source code.

545
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
Graham 40.

546
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Norfolk.

547
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
Queer.

548
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
And now I want to tell you either.

549
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Don't rush in Charlie fucked up my life.

550
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
For six years.

551
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
I used an Apple Mac.

552
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,800
Perfectly happy.

553
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,800
No worries whatsoever.

554
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Looked absolutely great.

555
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
Works absolutely great.

556
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
But the pot father said,

557
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
I've got to use cast blaster.

558
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
So I bought a fucking laptop.

559
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,800
For as long as I can remember,

560
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,800
I've always enjoyed a cup of rosy.

561
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,800
Always.

562
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,800
You never drank a cup of rosy.

563
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Tea.

564
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
Anything else?

565
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,800
Don't have a taste for coffee.

566
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
But the pot father says,

567
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
I've got to have a bleeding sense.

568
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
So I bought one.

569
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
At my sixteenth birthday,

570
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,800
I've got given a Phillips fillet shave.

571
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,800
Triple-headed electric dry shaver.

572
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
It works.

573
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
I love it.

574
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Never used anything else.

575
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
But the pot father says,

576
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
I've got to have a bleeding Gillette with a battery in it.

577
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
And it's my brace.

578
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,800
I have a brace.

579
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
So I might have argued.

580
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,800
So the laptop catches a bleeding cold or something.

581
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,800
And sends out me entire address book to a spammer.

582
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
Which then everyone I know.

583
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Everyone I've emailed.

584
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
All my friends.

585
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
All my relatives.

586
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Get fucking spam emails.

587
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
Thank you very much indeed.

588
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
And now, of course, they're not talking to me.

589
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,800
I gave the sense.

590
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
I owe to my mum.

591
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Could she likes coffee?

592
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
Your mum is a sense.

593
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
I love your sweet heart.

594
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
Sweet heart.

595
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,800
A bleeding thing caught on fire.

596
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
And burns me mum's kitchen down.

597
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
No.

598
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
She ain't talking to me no more.

599
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Oh, do you believe me?

600
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,800
And the Gillette Razer.

601
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,800
Well, it was me boyfriends birthday.

602
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
I said to him,

603
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
The art darling.

604
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,800
Have a nice Gillette vibrate in Razer.

605
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
The pot father says it's fantastic.

606
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
He's now me ex-boyfriend.

607
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
But he's in a beautiful new relationship with the end.

608
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,800
Liverpool Eden Razer.

609
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
So pot father.

610
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,800
Thanks very fucking much.

611
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
May you always have wind.

612
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Right up your asshole.

613
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
Folder.

614
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
Folder.

615
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
That is so funny.

616
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,800
That's the guy that the does Linda.

617
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
Oh, really?

618
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
Yeah, that's a creative shit out there.

619
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
Yeah.

620
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,800
And that is very funny.

621
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
That's good, isn't it?

622
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
That's good.

623
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,800
I think next we're going to meet with some more independent producers.

624
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
They're very manly queer.

625
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Very manly queer.

626
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
That's very manly.

627
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Yeah.

628
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
All right.

629
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
Anything we need to talk about.

630
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
We need to talk about MTV Awards real quick.

631
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
Because we used to go to them.

632
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,800
Yep.

633
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,800
Yeah.

634
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,800
Well, actually, it was a good show.

635
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
I mean, it was not cheap.

636
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
I mean everything.

637
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,800
Well, expensive doesn't always translate.

638
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
No, no.

639
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,800
There's a lot of things happening there.

640
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
Yeah.

641
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
But it didn't flow.

642
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
It was way too much hip-off.

643
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,800
Yeah.

644
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,800
Way too much fucking hip-hop show.

645
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,800
And then you see the panic at the disco wins best video of the year.

646
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Yeah.

647
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
Well, we're good.

648
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
I love that.

649
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
Yeah.

650
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
They love that.

651
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
That is so good.

652
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
Well, they're smart.

653
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
They're on the positive music network.

654
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
These guys got it together.

655
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,800
I love that sort of clothes.

656
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
Mm-hmm.

657
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
I love that sort of music.

658
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
I was so inject black fabulous.

659
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,800
Everything you did, like, didn't work.

660
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
I mean, I know all the gags and everything.

661
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
It wasn't supposed to work.

662
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Yeah.

663
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
It was supposed to be stupid.

664
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
But it turned out being pretty stupid.

665
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
Yeah.

666
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
You know.

667
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,800
And I guess the part I liked the best was Al Gore.

668
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,800
Yeah.

669
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
Al Gore came out.

670
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,800
He was good.

671
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800
You know, just...

672
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
They adored him.

673
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
Yeah, just...

674
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,800
The kids adored him.

675
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,800
Yeah.

676
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
Talked his, just did his thing.

677
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,800
Yeah.

678
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,800
Showed his slides.

679
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
Boom, boom, boom.

680
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,800
The one sort of movement.

681
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,800
The way he said it was very good.

682
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Yeah.

683
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,800
Yeah.

684
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,800
No.

685
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,800
I mean, and it was such a brush of breath there after...

686
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
Fresh air, yeah.

687
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
You know what?

688
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,800
Yeah, I want to thank Jimmy Alvin.

689
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
Jimmy Alvin.

690
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
Jimmy Alvin.

691
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
Jimmy Alvin.

692
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,800
To the peeps.

693
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
Each child.

694
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,800
And I'm like, oh.

695
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Please, please.

696
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
Please.

697
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
And Christina Aguilera wasn't...

698
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
I didn't like that song.

699
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,800
I didn't know.

700
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
No, no.

701
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
She normally blows me away.

702
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
No.

703
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,800
So you had to have to say that the best was...

704
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,800
That was a little bit too, too.

705
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
How can I explain that?

706
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,800
You have to be very patient to listen to a song like that.

707
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,800
It's not for the...

708
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,800
It's a wrong song.

709
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Yeah.

710
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,800
The audience...

711
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
Yeah.

712
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,800
It's exactly that.

713
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,800
So it was not the place for it.

714
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
I don't know.

715
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,800
Let me say that.

716
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,800
So that was a pity.

717
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,800
Yeah, that was too bad.

718
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,800
I thought that a Beyonce, Beyonce, was very, very good.

719
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,800
Totally stolen from Janet Jackson.

720
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,800
But it was Janet Jackson all over.

721
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
But I mean, it was...

722
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,800
We were saying Jackson.

723
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,800
This is already on the internet.

724
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,800
People are now comparing the two performances.

725
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
It is completely the same.

726
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,800
Michael, a little bit of Michael in there.

727
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,800
Well, Janet's always had a little bit of...

728
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
Yeah.

729
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,800
It's probably Paul Abdul choreography.

730
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,800
And I think about it.

731
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
She used to...

732
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,800
Yeah, she did a lot of Janet Jackson's.

733
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,800
Doesn't do...

734
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,800
No, no.

735
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
Beyonce.

736
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,800
No, Beyonce stole it.

737
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
That was stolen.

738
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,800
I mean, I thought you meant that...

739
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Paul Abdul did the...

740
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
The...

741
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,800
Goryography of...

742
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Of Beyonce.

743
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
I don't...

744
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
I don't think so.

745
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
No, no, no.

746
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
No, no, no.

747
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
What I mean is that Beyonce just totally ripped...

748
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
Janet Jackson's dance.

749
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,800
Yeah, absolutely.

750
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
So that...

751
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
And...

752
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
I wonder what she looks like at night...

753
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,800
What she takes off the wig.

754
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
She has no hair, does she?

755
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800
I don't think she has a lot of hair.

756
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,800
I bet it's really...

757
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,800
You really...

758
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,800
Oh, that's the problem with a lot of people.

759
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800
Like someone taking, you know, shaving off their mustache, you know?

760
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
Yeah.

761
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,800
But a lot of women have extensions and there's actually nothing left.

762
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,800
And especially when you wear extensions, your hair will fall off.

763
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
Like Paris Hilton.

764
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
Did her hair...

765
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Didn't her hair fall off?

766
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,800
Well, that's why you see those girls walking around with your hair after a while.

767
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
Because there's nothing left.

768
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Nothing left.

769
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,800
It's too heavy.

770
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,800
But talking about Algorra...

771
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
Uh...

772
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Wouldn't he make a wonderful precedent?

773
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Am I wrong?

774
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
Well, what are you looking for in a president right here?

775
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
Something like...

776
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,800
Like he is.

777
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
He's...

778
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
Well, what would be the first thing you'd want him to do?

779
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,800
He's so warm.

780
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,800
He comes over as somebody who really means it.

781
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Who means well, who doesn't have that certain smile that you might...

782
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,800
But do you think when he needs to kick ass, he can do it?

783
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
I think he can.

784
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,800
Yeah.

785
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,800
I mean, because...

786
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:53,800
He comes over as a very intelligent person who thinks very deep.

787
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
Yeah, deep.

788
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
Deep, that is the word.

789
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
I wonder what he's doing.

790
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
I see that in Bush.

791
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,800
Bush is very on deep.

792
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,800
On shallow.

793
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
On deep.

794
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,800
On deep.

795
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,800
Yeah.

796
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,800
Shallow.

797
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,800
Shallow.

798
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,800
And...

799
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,800
Well, I didn't vote for Bush.

800
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
I know that.

801
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
Yeah.

802
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,800
I don't know if Carrie would have been any better.

803
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
He seems to have the personality.

804
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,800
And I don't like that smile that he constantly...

805
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,800
He produced like everything's okay, you know.

806
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
And that...

807
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,800
I call it a smoke.

808
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,800
A smoke?

809
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
A smoke?

810
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
Yeah.

811
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,800
It's horrible.

812
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,800
I don't see any other...

813
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,800
I don't really know who's going to be a worthwhile candidate.

814
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Yeah, I think...

815
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,800
I think American needs sort of a father figure.

816
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Don't you think so?

817
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,800
I don't know.

818
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
I really don't know what we need.

819
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
Come to Daddy.

820
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
I really don't know.

821
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
I think about this a lot.

822
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
I saw that whole...

823
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,800
There was an al-Qaeda special on the BBC.

824
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,800
And you...

825
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,800
And you just...

826
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,800
Look at that.

827
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,800
And you're like, we're all doomed.

828
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,800
Yeah.

829
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,800
We're talking...

830
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,800
Forget about it.

831
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,800
We're all fucked.

832
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Wasn't it amazing?

833
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,800
And so their conclusion was that all of this would go away.

834
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,800
If...

835
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,800
America stopped supporting Israel in the Middle East.

836
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,800
Yeah.

837
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,800
If it stopped supporting...

838
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Yeah.

839
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:21,800
...radical regimes that were either against...

840
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,800
...islam or any radical regime.

841
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,800
And what was the third one?

842
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,800
It was like...

843
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
It sounded pretty simple all of this.

844
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
It was very simple.

845
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
Oh, and get out of Iraq.

846
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,800
Yeah.

847
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,800
And it wasn't that there was a...

848
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
A quest of...

849
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,800
Uh...

850
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
That's...

851
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Bin Ladenau...

852
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,800
Who was it?

853
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,800
Somebody wanted to have a talk...

854
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,800
...with the president for a solution.

855
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
And he didn't want...

856
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,800
He said, I don't want to talk to...

857
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,800
I think was Iran, wasn't it?

858
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,800
I think...

859
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,800
Yeah.

860
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
Because the US...

861
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
Don't...

862
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
We don't talk to you, terrorists.

863
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
No.

864
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
There you go.

865
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Yeah.

866
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
No.

867
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,800
That was a very good point.

868
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,800
I mean...

869
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,800
I couldn't believe that.

870
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,800
Yeah.

871
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,800
The does sound pretty stupid, doesn't it?

872
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,800
It's childish.

873
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Yeah.

874
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,800
So I don't talk to you.

875
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
You know, I hate you.

876
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,800
So I'm not going to talk to you.

877
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,800
No solution at all.

878
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
Right.

879
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
I think...

880
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,800
I think...

881
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,800
I think we could bend on that.

882
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,800
And...

883
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,800
And do you remember that guy came...

884
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
...a couple of guys had...

885
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
...wemps weapons?

886
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
And they said, see that weapon?

887
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,800
I'm going to kill an American out with their weapons.

888
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,800
Well, yeah.

889
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Because, you know, it's money-made.

890
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,800
The way they said it...

891
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,800
Yeah.

892
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,800
It's all making machine.

893
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,800
Yeah.

894
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,800
Now, I was more afraid of...

895
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,800
You know, people who...

896
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,800
The kids...

897
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
Kids are just radicalized, which is pretty easy.

898
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
You know, if you have no future...

899
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Very nice country.

900
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,800
Yeah.

901
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
That's pretty easy.

902
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,800
So...

903
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,800
But I'm thinking...

904
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
Of all the principles that America stands for...

905
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
Yeah.

906
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
All the principles.

907
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
And you know me.

908
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,800
I'm pretty much a yank.

909
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
All the way through.

910
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
Yeah.

911
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,800
You know...

912
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,800
I'm more of an international yank.

913
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,800
But you are yank, you know.

914
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,800
A yank.

915
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,800
A yank.

916
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,800
A yank.

917
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,800
International yank.

918
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
I'm a yank.

919
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Yeah.

920
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
I think we could certainly bend...

921
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,800
There's no law that says we don't talk to terrorists.

922
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,800
There's no law.

923
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,800
I think you should listen to...

924
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,800
...everybody...

925
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,800
...everybody...

926
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
...everybody...

927
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
...doesn't listen to...

928
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,800
Isn't it what we learn our kids?

929
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,800
Teacher kids.

930
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
Teacher kids.

931
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800
Teacher kids?

932
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,800
Yeah.

933
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
I'm sorry.

934
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,800
My kids do listen to them.

935
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
Because if you don't listen...

936
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
I'm all for that.

937
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
Yeah.

938
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,800
I'm all for that.

939
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,800
And I was surprised that...

940
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,800
You know...

941
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,800
That...

942
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,800
I think it was around that they've...

943
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
They've said they want to talk.

944
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
I think it would be a pretty good idea.

945
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
It doesn't have to just be America.

946
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
It could be...

947
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,800
You know...

948
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,800
...when send bush and send Blair.

949
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,800
Yeah.

950
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,800
Because these are the top guys.

951
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,800
Don't send condolese a rise.

952
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,800
I'm tired of that.

953
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,800
That to me is like...

954
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,800
You know...

955
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
It's just not the same.

956
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,800
You want the CEO to show up when you're dealing with a big company?

957
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,800
You know what I know too?

958
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,800
Country.

959
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
Uh...

960
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,800
What's that all the women that they always send...

961
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,800
...with the same hair?

962
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,800
Women with the same hair?

963
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,800
Yeah.

964
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,800
They always send bush.

965
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,800
I'll take a women with thin hair for 400 please.

966
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,800
When you're seen hair, they're much of very intelligent.

967
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,800
They have no hair.

968
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,800
Like, metal, all bright?

969
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,800
Yes.

970
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,800
She had a hair problem.

971
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
She didn't have a hair problem.

972
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,800
Yeah.

973
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,800
Yeah.

974
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
She did.

975
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,800
And now there's another lady.

976
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,800
It's down to hair.

977
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
And now there's another lady.

978
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,800
I saw...

979
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,800
Another lady?

980
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,800
The one that they send from...

981
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
I think from...

982
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
Can't the lover...

983
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,800
No.

984
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,800
Great Britain is...

985
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,800
There's somebody.

986
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,800
Who was that then?

987
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,800
There's another lady.

988
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,800
A very thin...

989
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,800
A very thin...

990
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,800
A very thin...

991
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
Where they sent them?

992
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,800
She was now...

993
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,800
Where they sent them?

994
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,800
Over there talking to somebody.

995
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,800
I have no idea who that is.

996
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,800
Um...

997
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
And I thought...

998
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,800
They all have very thin hair.

999
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
So they should send someone with some decent hair?

1000
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,800
No.

1001
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
I think they...

1002
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
They all brainy people with...

1003
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,800
No, man.

1004
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,800
You gotta send the number one guy.

1005
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
The problem is...

1006
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,800
I don't know if our number one guy can handle the conversation.

1007
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,800
But send it.

1008
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
I'll send it.

1009
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,800
I'll send it.

1010
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,800
Cheney over too.

1011
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,800
Send all those guys.

1012
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,800
I think that'd be a really good idea.

1013
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,800
Go have a fucking power.

1014
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800
But isn't it always a problem?

1015
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,800
Also with families that don't communicate.

1016
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,800
That don't necessarily say you have to listen to each other.

1017
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,800
Yeah.

1018
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,800
You know?

1019
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,800
And also...

1020
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,800
Marriages that don't work.

1021
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,800
Listen.

1022
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,780
That's always the problem.

1023
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,780
But it's pretty impopular.

1024
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,780
You know, you have a slogan talk to the terrorist.

1025
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,780
That's a pretty impopular slogan.

1026
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,780
It is.

1027
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,780
But...

1028
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,780
Let's...

1029
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,780
You've got to mark it that somehow.

1030
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,780
So the catch is on.

1031
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,780
But I think talking would be good.

1032
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,780
That would be a really...

1033
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,780
If they're saying...

1034
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,780
Let's talk about it.

1035
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,780
How can you make...

1036
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,780
There's no solution if you don't...

1037
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,780
And we're stupid enough to...

1038
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,780
Listen to each other and talk to each other.

1039
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,780
Yeah.

1040
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,780
You're absolutely right.

1041
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,780
Yeah.

1042
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,780
Here listen to this guy.

1043
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,780
Hey Adam.

1044
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,780
This is Lee.

1045
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,780
You may not remember me but I called that couple weeks ago left

1046
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,780
and that's it.

1047
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,780
I am the guy in Indianapolis who...

1048
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,780
A writer's bicycle to...

1049
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:51,780
To help with this heart and mention that I always listen to your program while I'm writing.

1050
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,780
Yeah.

1051
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,780
And I was just now listening actually.

1052
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,780
I stopped and took a break.

1053
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,780
And I was just now listening.

1054
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,780
And of course, I'm a little bit behind on your programs.

1055
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:06,780
But you were on the episode where you were talking about all the...

1056
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:12,780
Warcraft that the kids are having to listen to on the TV.

1057
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,780
And that really hit home.

1058
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:20,780
And I just wanted to pass on something that my four-year-old son told me about two weeks ago.

1059
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:27,780
He said, Dad, did you know that a bunch of soldiers have torn up the whole world?

1060
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:32,780
And that, you know, that just made me stop for a moment.

1061
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,780
And I thought, you know, that's what he's seeing on TV.

1062
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,780
I tried to filter this stuff from him.

1063
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,780
I don't want to watch the news, but still it leaks in.

1064
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,780
And he's thinking that a bunch of soldiers have torn up the whole world.

1065
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,780
It's like, wow.

1066
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:51,780
Anyway, I tried to explain to him that that's not the case.

1067
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,780
But there are a lot of people who are trying to tear up parts of the world.

1068
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,780
And I don't know.

1069
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:00,780
It's something you can't really explain to a four-year-old.

1070
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,780
But the images are getting through and you can't help but to wonder what impact

1071
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,780
it's going to have on these kids.

1072
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,780
You know, this media saturated war environment that we live in.

1073
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,780
Anyway, well, still finding your show.

1074
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,780
Thank you.

1075
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,780
And have a good day.

1076
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,780
There you go.

1077
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:24,780
And I'm just going to say in the BBC documentary, they showed that the,

1078
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,780
of the converse or that happens on the exact same side of this,

1079
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:31,780
quote, war on terror, is when someone blows themselves up,

1080
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:40,780
they're shown on TV, like on Al Jazeera, as martyrs, heroes.

1081
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,780
Yeah, yeah.

1082
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,780
It's the same thing.

1083
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,780
You know, kids are going to go, oh, fuck.

1084
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,780
That's good.

1085
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,780
I want to be him.

1086
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,780
Yeah.

1087
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,780
You blow yourself up.

1088
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,780
You're here, though.

1089
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,780
So, there you go.

1090
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,780
No, that's nice bummer.

1091
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:57,780
We're all fucked.

1092
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,780
Yeah, we are.

1093
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,780
Colin, leave us a message.

1094
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,780
Plus 1, 2, 0, 1, 6, 2, 5, 6, 3, 5, 7.

1095
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,780
Put the plus in front of your, if you're storing into your mobile phone,

1096
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,780
plus 1, 2, 0, 1, 6, 2, 5, 6, 3, 5, 7.

1097
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,780
In London, 0, 2, 0, 7, 6, 8, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3.

1098
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:18,780
But, you know, I was just thinking all that, all that,

1099
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,780
my English is so bad today.

1100
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,780
I'm brain, my brain.

1101
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,780
The part of the brain is not working today.

1102
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,780
Let me slow myself down to your speed.

1103
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,780
You know what we're having now?

1104
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,780
All those wars.

1105
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,780
All those, it, it be influenced everything.

1106
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,780
Even your birthday cards didn't arrive.

1107
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,780
No, that's right.

1108
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,780
Yeah, yeah.

1109
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,780
They've had passed everybody's taste.

1110
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,780
You know what I mean?

1111
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,780
Yes.

1112
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,780
It's such a mess at the moment.

1113
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,780
And I just wanted to stop, please.

1114
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,780
Here you go.

1115
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,780
Here's one for you.

1116
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:55,780
Because of the very severe new security regulations,

1117
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,780
we were just talking about this just in.

1118
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,780
When you fly on KLM business class,

1119
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:06,780
you receive your choice of one little Dutch canal house.

1120
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,780
Yeah.

1121
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,780
Made of Delft Blue.

1122
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,780
We're Geneva.

1123
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,780
Filled with a Dutch gene called Geneva.

1124
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,780
Yes.

1125
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,780
They're going to stop this service because they can't check,

1126
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,780
and make sure that there's no explosives inside of this little...

1127
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,780
Oh, my God.

1128
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,780
Can you believe it?

1129
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,780
All the nice things in the world.

1130
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,780
All those little nice things that makes life so lovely.

1131
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,780
We'll go away.

1132
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,780
Not amazing.

1133
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,780
It's amazing.

1134
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,780
It's just amazing.

1135
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,780
I'm just so sad.

1136
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,780
And then here's something that's...

1137
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,780
This is kind of...

1138
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,780
You know, there's a lot of aviation people who sent me stuff.

1139
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,780
We email back and forth.

1140
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,780
So there apparently is a different story

1141
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,780
to Northwest Flight that returned back to Skipple.

1142
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1143
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,780
Because I never heard the truth about it.

1144
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,780
Okay. Well, so this is from a pilot.

1145
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,780
I'm not going to tell you who.

1146
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,780
And he wasn't on the flight,

1147
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,780
but someone in his company was.

1148
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,780
Okay.

1149
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,780
Here's an updated version of the events of the Bombay flight

1150
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,780
that turned around.

1151
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,780
There's some changes from the first time I told the two of you.

1152
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,780
I'll be careful when I fly there next week.

1153
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,780
Here we go.

1154
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:15,780
This guy sat in with the crew and the federal air marshals

1155
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,780
of the Amsterdam to Bombay flight that turned around

1156
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,780
at the hotel in Amsterdam and heard everything.

1157
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,780
You'll never believe it.

1158
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,780
The youngest of 12 men was age 19.

1159
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,780
The media had said they were between 25 and 35.

1160
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,780
Yeah.

1161
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,780
Completely cracked during interrogations,

1162
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,780
vomited on himself and confessed

1163
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:35,780
to coming from an al-Qaeda training camp in Africa.

1164
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,780
The media says they were all coming from some vacation spot.

1165
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:44,780
Karen Birmingham watched 11 of them get up immediately

1166
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:48,780
after take off before the fast and seat belt sign announcement

1167
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,780
and even before the green light went on.

1168
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,780
That's a flight of 10 that's going to be online.

1169
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:53,780
Yeah.

1170
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,780
Then they started to individually spread out

1171
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,780
and handed their cell phones to the,

1172
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,780
quote, head hauncho,

1173
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:01,780
a guy with a little beanie hat on.

1174
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,780
They had a total of 14 cell phones.

1175
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,780
He took his hat off and started drawing black lines

1176
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,780
on his forehead.

1177
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,780
The federal air marshal in C-16B watched the entire thing

1178
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,780
got up and then the fun began.

1179
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,780
Can't go into that now.

1180
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,780
Anyway, a bunch of horse crap was being said in the media.

1181
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:24,780
Apparently they definitely were on a suicide mission.

1182
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,780
But see that's what I mean.

1183
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,780
Interesting.

1184
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,780
It's always a different story.

1185
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:31,780
They make a different story because how many times did we

1186
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:36,780
ret our own story or hurt our own story on programs on TV?

1187
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,780
And it was never ever the truth.

1188
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:41,780
It was never the way we knew it.

1189
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:44,780
Well, and there's also more than one side to the truth.

1190
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,780
Yeah.

1191
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,780
Okay.

1192
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,780
Shall we leave it with that?

1193
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,780
Yeah.

1194
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:50,780
We've been going for 44 minutes.

1195
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,780
I'm not going to play another song.

1196
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:56,780
Well, I feel like we haven't finished though.

1197
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:57,780
We're not done.

1198
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,780
Well, you get, you get pissed off actually.

1199
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,780
Yeah.

1200
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,780
Yeah.

1201
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,780
Yeah.

1202
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:03,780
But not at you, my darling.

1203
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:04,780
No, I know that.

1204
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,780
And could you just update everyone on our morning sex?

1205
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,780
Is that, uh, to your satisfaction now?

1206
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,780
Is that, uh, everything okay there?

1207
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,780
Well, did we?

1208
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,780
Oh, yeah.

1209
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:14,780
No, it was nice.

1210
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,780
Okay.

1211
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,780
That's right.

1212
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,780
We got to go.

1213
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,780
We got to go look at the, uh, at the other house.

1214
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,780
Yes.

1215
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,780
You know, because you never know what happens.

1216
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,780
50% is not 100%.

1217
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,780
No fucking way.

1218
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:25,780
Yeah.

1219
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:26,780
All right, baby.

1220
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:27,780
So, uh, talk to you guys tomorrow.

1221
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,780
Love you on.

1222
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:29,780
All right, love you too.

1223
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,780
Bye.

1224
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,780
Bye.

1225
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,780
Bye.

1226
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,780
Another pod show podcast.

1227
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,780
Stick it in your ear.

1228
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,780
Get this podcast and we're great ones.

1229
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,780
Like it on the high performance podcast,

1231
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,780
I love it.
