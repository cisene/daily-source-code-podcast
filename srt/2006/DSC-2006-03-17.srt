We're the older guys.

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I was a little bit kind of my head.

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I wished that I were dead.

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But I don't think you'll ever let me be.

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I used to be with this gold.

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And if I air airs the gold,

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll try and go him and leave him in the street.

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And then he says to me,

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I air you, you know he was bloody.

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And he called that thing a higher.

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But each time I share,

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I know that I am learning.

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He hides his hand while my friends are chanting.

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Good morning.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let me back to that old man.

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Where it leads,

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll never know.

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Take me back to that place.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I've been where I've said.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I've never been.

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I can't swim.

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So I'll fly as his belly.

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That old man.

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I know that I'm drunk and you're born.

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Everybody's gonna get drunk and I'll eat.

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We're gonna have to get by.

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Everybody's gonna get drunk and I'll eat.

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Everybody know.

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
When you take me,

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Sing me a tune.

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If I'm out of a friend,

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This shot's for you.

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Feel it burn.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This it goes down.

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But watch your hours.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It comes another round.

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Drink.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Go on and tell your dancing.

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's better to run away.

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I know that you're drunk and you're born.

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Everybody's gonna get drunk and I'll eat.

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000

Everybody's gonna get drunk and I'll eat.

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Everybody's gonna get drunk and I'll eat.

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Everybody's gonna get drunk and I'll eat.

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Everybody's gonna get drunk and I'll eat.

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Everybody's gonna get drunk and I'll eat.

115

Everybody's gonna get drunk and I'll eat.

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Everybody's gonna get drunk and I'll eat.

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
All right, let me back to that open road, where it leads,

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll never know, take me back to that place I've been,

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Where it starts at all.

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So, and...

126
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
God bless the podsafe music network.

127
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
There's something for every occasion, isn't there?

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

129
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Happy St. Patrick's Day coming to you from Curricondo in Raining,

130
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Northern California, from the Curricondo in San Francisco.

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's shit!

132
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Oh, man, yesterday was just...

133
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No walking home, that's for sure.

134
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And, of course, I was bumming I didn't have Trinity with me

135
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
after a long day at the office.

136
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Wow, what a day.

137
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh, we'll be talking about that a bit about the Board of Directors meeting at the pod show HQ.

138
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And, actually, the whole day was just one continuous doing stuff,

139
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
really, really busy.

140
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It was around, I think, around at 8 o'clock,

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
that Ron and I discovered we were the only two people left in the office

142
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and we were doing, like, an MP3 playoff, you know, where he play a song on his speakers and his office

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and I'd play one a little bit louder in mind and back and forth.

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So, after we got tired of that childish stuff, we decided to go home.

145
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And I just collapsed.

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I literally...

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Came in.

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There was something actually on TV yesterday, it was pretty interesting.

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
On TV, yes, they had...

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Was it the business...

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The Daily Business News Show or something like that on KQED

152
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
here, out here in San Francisco.

153
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And I was watching that.

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It was about earmarking.

155
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Basically, the way that Congress can sneak in all kinds of pork barrel budgets into bills that are being passed.

156
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It was a fascinating stuff.

157
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Basically, we're getting ripped off.

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That was nothing new there.

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And I just collapsed.

160
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You know, I had a pizza from the microwave.

161
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And I was in bed a sound asleep at nine.

162
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Only to be woken around 430 this morning.

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And I was pretty much done anyway with sleeping,

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
but I woke up because I could hear music and like,

165
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
wow, what was the music coming from?

166
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And I realized it was my serious satellite receiver,

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
which I always have tuned to channel 75,

168
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
which is...

169
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What's the name of that channel?

170
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's like the...

171
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's the old people, so a channel.

172
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Let me turn it off for a second.

173
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let me see if I can get it turned on from where I am.

174
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah, it's like the elephant's Gerald channel is what it is.

175
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And so, what happened apparently is the power went out.

176
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And it must have been out for quite a while because

177
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
the portage, which runs Casplaster, which is always on,

178
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
was identifying that the battery had run down almost all the way to the end.

179
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You know, how PCs work differently from Max, right?

180
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If you're Mac starts to run out of power and he plugging the cord

181
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
or you turn the power back on, then all of a sudden,

182
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
all the warnings go away.

183
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
On Windows, of course, they don't go away.

184
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So I can only presume that it went down to low power,

185
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
so I must have been out for a couple of hours when it turned back on.

186
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And that, of course, is what triggered the satellite radio

187
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
because it was on mute.

188
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But then when the power came back on, it was no longer on mute.

189
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So stuff to remember there.

190
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Apologies about...

191
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
First of all, let me give some props here for the opening of the show.

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You heard Mark Gunn with the leprechaun song.

193
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
From the pod save music network, music.podshow.com.

194
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Some fantastic greetings there from some Irish podcast.

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Some Irish podcasters.

196
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Much appreciated that show to my Gmail this morning.

197
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And the song was The Bloody Irish Boys with Drunk Tonight.

198
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm not a guy who understands drinking a lot.

199
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I think you know that.

200
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I think we all know what my poison is.

201
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Anyway, apologies for yesterday's show.

202
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Got plenty of comments.

203
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Like this one.

204
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Hi Adam. This is Franco from Rock as the Italian.

205
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I've just listened to the Charlie Free Five Four.

206
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And well, you started as usual with your wonderful tube compressed voice.

207
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We are all used to.

208
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Like this.

209
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Though I thought I'd share another beautiful San Francisco sunrise with you.

210
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Not sure if we're going to have one today.

211
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Wow.

212
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That valve compressed sound.

213
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's very, very, very good.

214
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Then you came through this FAQ stuff and then came out like this.

215
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It works for me.

216
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But if you have other thoughts about nose hair, please let me know.

217
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And particularly, I want to know it.

218
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Or even worse, like this.

219
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Sticking your nose and you turn it and it kind of rips the hairs out.

220
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
No.

221
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Oh, Adam.

222
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I just hope I'm full.

223
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I didn't hear to this.

224
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't know why.

225
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That would be very, very bad for your reputation.

226
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay.

227
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
There's just one thing you can do to make me forgive you.

228
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That is, give me your magic numbers for the TLA 552.

229
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And that would be okay.

230
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's all for now.

231
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
This is Franco Faroma, Roccas Titania.

232
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Bye bye to everybody.

233
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Franco.

234
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Thank you, my friend.

235
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Very much.

236
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yeah.

237
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I messed that up.

238
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You know what happened is.

239
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
First of all, I'm not on the tube compressor.

240
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's at home.

241
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So I appreciate the fact that you liked the sound that I started off with.

242
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And then I messed it up because there were some really soft audio feedback comments.

243
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And I was trying to crank them up on the mixer and unbeknownst to really me because

244
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Hey, it's six o'clock in the morning when I do this stuff.

245
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I totally overmodulated Casplaster and what Casplaster does is really starts to try and handle

246
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
the too much sound that it starts to compress it and then you get the nastiness there.

247
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The magic numbers for the TL, was it a 50, 52, 50, my TLS, TLA, 52, 50.

248
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I guess you want to know what my settings are.

249
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't know if I could take a picture, I guess, of where the knobs are.

250
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But I mean, it doesn't really give you everything you need to know.

251
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't think, but I'll gladly do that when I get back home.

252
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Some new about Casplaster, by the way, the new beta version, beta 61 is what we're at now.

253
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
61, my goodness.

254
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Some really cool new features.

255
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
One of them is that after you've played something in Casplaster, it grays out.

256
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So you know, it kind of makes it less confusing.

257
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You can see where you are and it just gives you, yeah, it just really makes a lot easier.

258
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But I just wanted to mention that if you haven't upgraded to beta 61, you might want to consider that because it's cool.

259
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Very, very cool.

260
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So yesterday morning, after I got to show up and out, I was at the office around 815, 830.

261
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Board of Directors started to trickle in around 9 o'clock and we never had a board meeting at Pod Show HQ.

262
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And it was pretty funny because normally these board meetings are held at Kleiner Perkins on the infamous Sand Hill Road.

263
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We're all the big venture capital firms are located out here in California.

264
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And they have a board room that is bigger than the entire condo, actually.

265
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm not kidding.

266
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's just humongous and a table that goes with it.

267
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's a major penis extender board room.

268
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So those guys are pretty spoiled.

269
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And I guess we had eight, eight or nine people who come in for these meetings.

270
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
That was pretty funny.

271
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Our board room, our conference room, is very thin and very long.

272
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So you can fit about, I don't know, about 15 people in there.

273
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But basically our conference room is smaller than most of the interiors of the jets of our board of directors.

274
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So we had some fun with that.

275
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And it started to stink up a little bit after an hour or so.

276
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But it was a great meeting.

277
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I didn't say anything.

278
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I didn't mention the frog.

279
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You know, yesterday we did the special board of directors secret word of the day, which was frog.

280
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And at some point the conversation turned towards, I think it was length of podcast.

281
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And then someone said, well, you know, I'm still three days behind on the daily source code.

282
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And there's a lot of talk because it's exciting.

283
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You know, people like to talk about the content probably more than about the business.

284
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And I kind of said, oh, well, yeah.

285
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Well, that's, and then all of a sudden, there he was.

286
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Ladies and gentlemen, our true board of directors up a month.

287
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Jerry Newman went ribbit.

288
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Very cool, Jerry.

289
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I think, I think, I think, I think she might have done a ribbit as well.

290
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But that was way on the other end.

291
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So two out of six.

292
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Two out of six ain't bad.

293
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But it was great.

294
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We had gosh.

295
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And actually this time, we put him to work.

296
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We have all kinds of stuff.

297
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
We want our board members to do for us.

298
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So it was one of the best board meetings we've had.

299
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Showed them the pod show plus and the pdn.

300
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And some of the shows that are coming up and some of the video stuff.

301
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And it was, it was good.

302
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And it's nice to, you know, this is not a report card.

303
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We don't have to report to our board.

304
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
This is a report for us.

305
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And that's why I enjoy the board board meetings.

306
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You know, okay, here's where we are.

307
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Here's how we're tracking against our plan.

308
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Obviously, some of that has to do with finances.

309
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But a lot is with, you know, just goals that we've set for ourselves.

310
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And we're doing very well based on our plan.

311
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
We're very happy.

312
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And then it's just like, you know, smart people in the room to bounce ideas off of.

313
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And I got to say, it's, uh, I loved it.

314
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It was a lot of fun.

315
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Wow, yesterday we had a Metro sexual moment.

316
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And, you know.

317
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So the discussion, uh, was about nose hair.

318
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That's a new conversation that we started up.

319
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Normally, if I got responses, you know, if I get responses to a Metro moment or

320
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
an eternity, then I kind of delay until the next segment.

321
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
But I could not wait to share this piece of news about the new conversation that we started up.

322
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Normally, if I got responses, you know, if I get responses to a Metro moment or an eternity, then I kind of delay until the next segment.

323
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:01,000
But I could not wait to share this piece of audio feedback when you're regarding the removal of nose hair for the Metro man.

324
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Hey Adam, this is the friggin' satellite repairman.

325
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Wait a minute, wait a minute, stop the music, stop the music.

326
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I have nothing to do with satellites.

327
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Not only that, but here's another news flash.

328
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
There is no satellite window.

329
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I have a regular window with a screen in it that keeps mosquitoes out.

330
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I do not wear a space suit.

331
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And unfortunately, I am not waitless.

332
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But that's not what I'm here for.

333
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm here to speak about the Metro sexual moment on nose hair.

334
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Cutting is definitely better than plucking.

335
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But plucking does have a special place in Metro sexuality.

336
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I will explain.

337
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Every guy has had this experience of being with his gal.

338
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
When she's talking about some emotional upheaval that she's going through.

339
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
We've all been there.

340
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
We've all had that glazed look.

341
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
We've all had that secret feeling.

342
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
If I could only give a crap about this.

343
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Well, here's how us Metro sexual pull it off.

344
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
When she isn't looking.

345
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Reach up to that nose.

346
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Grab a few nose hairs and he yank them out.

347
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I guarantee that your eyes will begin to tear.

348
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Add a few fake sniffles.

349
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And suddenly you are sensitive.

350
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It works every time.

351
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Hey, man.

352
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I sure hope Ross isn't listening to what you're saying here.

353
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Let me just try that.

354
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Oh, second.

355
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Wait.

356
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Good day, Adam.

357
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's Michael Smith from Indie Film Nation.

358
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm excited about joining the pod show podcast delivery network.

359
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Indie Film Nation is a weekly show about independent films and the process of making Indie films.

360
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The show features the latest industry news and updates from the film festival circuits from around the globe.

361
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And every show features an indebted interview with an Indie film maker or industry professional from the US that UK or Australia.

362
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Hey, and I even get a chance to spin a couple of tracks off the pod safe music network on every show.

363
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
www.indiefilmnation.com.

364
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Thanks, Adam.

365
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Oh, no, no, thank you and welcome to the network.

366
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Fantastic.

367
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I love it, man.

368
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So many people who are just excited about joining it.

369
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So on the release schedule, the unleash of pod show plus and the pod show pdn.

370
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Today, we're going to have our meeting about what exactly we're going to release with because we have of course

371
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
if we have a ton of features and things that we want to come out with right away and then there's a whole bunch of things we want to

372
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
show up some more.

373
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
We're stuck today, actually, is the, you know, the shoremail integration and we're talking about this that we can't open up anything.

374
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Even commerce on the pod safe music network until we are able to send the registration emails back and forth.

375
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
God, I hate being ripped off like that.

376
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So that may push it back a couple days because we really, you know, if the emails aren't working right, we can't do anything.

377
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That is not entirely dependent, well, we have dependencies based upon the service and being white list and not definitely want to check it before before we go live.

378
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But everything else seems pretty good.

379
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Today we, we meet about the the unleash schedule, so I'll keep you up to speed on that.

380
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And yesterday it was funny because, you know, there was all kinds of meetings that were being scheduled for today for Friday and I'm like, oh, no, I can't because I have, you know,

381
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Cali's coming in.

382
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Cali Lewis, our fearless leader from the geek intelligence agency and she's coming to San Francisco and she's going to interview me and I don't have time.

383
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I want to spend time with Cali and I was a real dick about it, you know, but of course, who was the real dick.

384
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah, I fucked up.

385
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Hey Adam, baby, it's Cali.

386
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
We're not going to have until Monday and I don't want you to go.

387
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
They think and I'm standing you up, but Adam, I have to admit, I'm a little stressed.

388
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Oh, what exactly does a girl wear to meet the pod father?

389
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Oh, what's the etiquette?

390
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I checked Emily post.

391
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's not there.

392
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Do I bow and kiss your ring?

393
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Is it a European kiss kiss on the cheek cheek thing?

394
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's so intimidating.

395
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And then what happens if your hair isn't working?

396
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm worried you'll back out at the last minute and that's not good.

397
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I fly out there and you don't show up.

398
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I mean, I do briefs from time to time without my hair looking the way I want it, so you can't let that be an excuse.

399
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Oh, and now you say you have questions for me.

400
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Oh, what kind of questions do you have?

401
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Oh, my God, am I even prepared for this?

402
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Of course I am.

403
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I can't wait.

404
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'll see you on Monday.

405
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Oh, Kelly, baby.

406
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh, yeah.

407
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Nothing special.

408
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
But I have questions for you.

409
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Oh, yeah.

410
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You just have to wait.

411
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm excited about meeting Kelly.

412
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You got a couple of new fans by the way, who are on our board of directors.

413
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Oh, yeah.

414
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm looking forward to it.

415
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Okay, so I have some extra time today to do things that I was trying to push off, which

416
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I've probably got rescheduled for Monday, but Kelly, I will be there.

417
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I promise you, some things happening this weekend.

418
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Tomorrow morning, we're doing, I don't know if it's the actual first episode or if it's a run through or if it's a pilot or a demo.

419
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But we have a game show, which we're working on called bone and tomorrow.

420
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I guess we're doing the first, it must be just the first run through.

421
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'll let you know how that goes, but I'm really excited.

422
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I heard something as a bit of the production.

423
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's going to be pretty fun with real prizes, valuable prizes.

424
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Timothy Pilgrim sent me an email regarding that guy from Dark Matters podcast yesterday who sent you the voice message.

425
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Well, that was actually was that two days ago, I think.

426
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yeah, you thought he said black skies as he signed off instead of the tailwinds bit that you aviators use.

427
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I think he said dark skies, which alludes to the worldwide movement to limit light pollution that ruins the night sky.

428
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
The professional and amateur astronomers have a hard time looking through their telescopes.

429
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Think about all that wasted light that is spilled up into the urban night sky and bounces off moisture in the air.

430
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Hell, just driving to the countryside turn around and look back into the city.

431
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You'll see what I mean by the glow on the horizon.

432
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Okay, so that's Tim from the twisted wrist podcast, Dark skies.

433
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Okay, well, Pilots don't like hearing that.

434
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
We don't like to hear Dark skies, and we don't participate in that.

435
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That's for sure.

436
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Let's see what we have.

437
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Talked about the need for another developer at Pod Show, Brian Longest.

438
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,000
SB Super VP Executive Director, Muckity Muck of Operations.

439
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So many emails that Adam I heard on the Charlie said you need to get this from me.

440
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Here's some more verbiage on the person we're looking for.

441
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So if you're looking for a gig and you are in the San Francisco area.

442
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
The qualifications are email authentication standards.

443
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
SPF Domain keys, sender ID and DKIM.

444
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Delta Kilo, India Mike, whatever the hell that is.

445
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Previous experience with guaranteed email delivery companies, MTA email application servers,

446
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
email delivery, delivery monitoring, and accredited sender programs.

447
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Okay, if you fit that bill, we'd love to hear from you just send an email to

448
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Adam at podshow.com.

449
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Better yet, send it to Brian at podshow.com.

450
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And we'll get to you ASAP.

451
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's cool, man.

452
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
We're looking for more people to get this stuff done.

453
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And I guess that is pretty important for the unleash otherwise Brian wouldn't have mentioned it.

454
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Matt Moran, aka M spoke.

455
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Adam, you mentioned on DSC 353 that you'd be meeting the guys from British telecom.

456
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It would be good if you could ask them how they square the idea of podcasts, online gaming, voice over IP,

457
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
music downloads with their very low bandwidth usage caps.

458
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I acquired them on this late last year, and the truth is the customer has no way of realizing

459
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
the bandwidth they're using until they get a bill from British telecom.

460
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
BT or the old nationalized telecom supplier in the UK.

461
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Because of this, they are the prominent ISP.

462
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Basically, they own all the lines no matter which ISP you get your connection from.

463
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You mentioned that these guys are important.

464
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Yes, they are, but they seem to constantly be 18 months behind everything exciting that's going on with the net.

465
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Well, Matt, it's funny you say that because I actually did talk to them about that.

466
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Just so we're walking out the door.

467
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Because at the end of the meeting, I said, hey, you know, I should tell you my British telecom broadband story.

468
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And they were like, oh no, oh don't tell me.

469
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I said, oh yeah, it was horrible. You guys sucked ass.

470
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And I wound up going with easing it.

471
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Because they gave me a dedicated line.

472
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And more importantly, they gave me unmetered bandwidth.

473
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And I could see, you know, a whole bunch of glances going back and forth.

474
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And here's what they didn't tell me, but what I learned, if that makes any sense.

475
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Apparently, they're not doing anything about people going over their limit.

476
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And they realize that to be competitive, they'll have to do something with unmetered bandwidth.

477
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Of course, this was all installed, you know, these caps because of peer-to-peer.

478
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Oh, shoot. You know what, satellite folks, checking out the stars cast on serious channel 102.

479
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
PCH is next with Mark Yoshimoto Nemkov.

480
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And I'll be back here Monday, starting at six Eastern three Pacific time with the pod show on serious.

481
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Thank you all very much.

482
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Peter, go ahead, close your window.

483
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Okay, they're gone.

484
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Yeah, so back to the British telecom folks.

485
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Yeah, I think they realize it.

486
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And I think they understand that they have to change that.

487
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
But this was really an issue of peer-to-peer file sharing.

488
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And it's about the upstream.

489
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
You know, I think they're confused, but they really do understand that that's not going to fly.

490
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And I said, look, you guys do like, what is it?

491
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You can do 40 gigs a month total downstream and upstream traffic.

492
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I said, I eat that in two days.

493
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And I think that you'll see some changes there.

494
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
These were the, this was the CEO of British telecom broadband, the retail group.

495
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So it is completely about about the stuff that is delivered to the home.

496
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And we're going to see how far we get with them.

497
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
They certainly seem like guys and gals who were very switched on and very excited about doing something cool,

498
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
not just with broadband in general, but really with pod casting specifically.

499
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So I'll keep you up to speed as we move on through.

500
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Comic strip.

501
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Comic strip.

502
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Comic strip.

503
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Comic strip.

504
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Comic strip.

505
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Comic strip.

506
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Comic strip.

507
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Comic strip.

508
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
You can't finish up a week without a word from CSB.

509
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Hi, Adam Kerry.

510
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Imagine that there would be a mobile cast blaster, a program that would record podcasts in mobile phones and

511
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
PDAs.

512
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And it would also upload podcasts to the server.

513
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
All this recording and uploading would be done inside of mobile phones and PDAs.

514
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Well, at www.voysatom.com, you can already find a mobile podcasting program that is doing these things.

515
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
However, only for Windows Mobile devices.

516
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Unfortunately, it can upload to one special server only and

517
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
user cannot change the server where to upload.

518
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Now that you and your Jewish pal Ron Bloom have a company for but

519
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Whoa.

520
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

521
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Comic strip blogger.

522
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
The hell is that?

523
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Oh man, you are over the line.

524
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Now that's stupid.

525
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Does it matter if my partner is Jewish, Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim?

526
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
That shouldn't matter.

527
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Why do you mention that?

528
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Now you start to show your true colors comics strip bloggers.

529
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
That does not vote very well for you.

530
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I thought that maybe you could do similar programs like that.

531
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Like that from www.voysatom.com.

532
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
But especially and exclusively for podcasts that are very networked.

533
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So the servers of podcasts that are very network would be had coded.

534
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I promise that absolutely for free.

535
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I promise that I would help testing this program for free for you.

536
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It would also be fun.

537
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Yo.

538
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yes, I am not much wine Steve.

539
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
You know, comic strip blogger.

540
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
What the hell is that?

541
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
First of all, I don't care about podcasting from mobile phones.

542
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I don't need those special servers.

543
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You've said before, plenty of mobile devices can record.

544
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
There's plenty of applications that let you FTP file somewhere.

545
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Or email it.

546
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
That's even though I kind of just like receiving it that way.

547
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
But yeah, it's like, there's all kinds that we don't need no specialized servers.

548
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And she, I really, really appreciate your offer.

549
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
As long as I go by the server for you to test it for me.

550
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Absolutely for free.

551
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
No CSB.

552
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I think you need to think a little bit about what you're doing here over the weekend.

553
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And think about the things that you're saying.

554
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
This is a little bit off color, even for you.

555
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I'm not digging that.

556
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Why ended up for today for the Friday, Charlie.

557
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
An email from Kevin Reeves, our buddy,

558
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
we've played many times here from the Pod Safe Music Network.

559
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
He has a contest which you can check out at Kevin Reeves.net.

560
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And the contest is he's giving away his autographed Fender Squire Guitar.

561
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Here's how it works, the person who pre-orders the most CDs of his new CD

562
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
to give away to family friends, co-workers, lovers, etc.

563
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Will win Kevin's Guitar plus a mention in the liner notes of the album and on his website.

564
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And he goes on to say, I love it when artists are marketing and thinking about marketing.

565
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
This would be a great for a company who wanted to get their website product to service out to a global audience.

566
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
All the information is on the front page of my website at Kevinreves.net.

567
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Well, dude.

568
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
No problem, of course.

569
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Happy to mention that.

570
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And also want you to hear the new Kevin Reeves tune.

571
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It's wasted.

572
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Night of the night.

573
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
We sit here alone.

574
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Here in my house.

575
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
We don't feel like home.

576
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I have lost our control of emotion.

577
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It is such a tumultuous ocean.

578
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
We have the day.

579
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I've been life's pretty gay.

580
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I go on my way.

581
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It's just not the same.

582
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I think I can feel and say the norm.

583
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But there's always a calm in the eyes of the stars.

584
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And to wasted night, y'all know where.

585
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And to wasted night, y'all know where.

586
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And to wasted night, y'all know where.

587
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Now I'm cheering for all the reason.

588
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It's the feeling I'm the same.

589
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
It's just a piece of waste.

590
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Now you've gone away.

591
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So night, I was right.

592
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Just to get it all out.

593
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Night of the night, y'all know where.

594
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Night of the night, y'all know where.

595
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Well, I can't wait to see you face to face.

596
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And I'm hoping to shove you in and embrace.

597
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So wasted night, y'all know where.

598
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And to wasted night, y'all know where.

599
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Now I'm cheering for all the reason.

600
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It's the feeling I'm the same.

601
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It's just a piece of waste.

602
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Now you've gone away.

603
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Now you've gone away.

604
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Night of the night, I said here alone.

605
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And you know it ain't right, being out on my own.

606
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Out of Someday I'll see you but until then..

607
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
How I think about you over and over.

608
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And no or no.

609
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So wasted night, y'all know where.

610
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And I'm so wasted now and now I'm away

611
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Now I'm here alone and this nothing's left to say

612
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And it's so wasted now and now I'm here alone

613
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And now I'm here alone and now I'm here alone

614
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And now I'm here alone and now I'm away

615
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Now I'm away

616
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
So I'm known that I feel so wasted baby

617
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And now I'm here alone and now I'm here alone

618
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And now I'm here alone and now I'm here alone

619
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And now I'm here alone

620
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:12,920
Well, although it's not the intent of the lyrics, kind of fits with St. Patrick's Day.

621
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:18,120
Kevin Reeves, wasted. There you go. Ladies and gentlemen, podcasting, saving the world.

622
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:23,320
No, no, wait a minute. Podcasting. Save the world and win valuable prizes.

623
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:29,240
