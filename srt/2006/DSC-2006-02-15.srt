1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Delta Sierra Charley, three, three, six.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,680
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:11,240
It's Adam coming to you from the Tribeca Grand Hotel in New York, which is still

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,960
all slushy and cold yet we had a beautiful day.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,400
It was a nice and sunny and a perfect day to go rushing around from office building to office

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,040
building and planning to talk about in the daily source code.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,680
Like, I got to admit, I have not done a lot of preparation.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:38,760
It's really early Wednesday morning and PWFent and I will be off to the serious headquarters

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,400
in just a little bit and we're going to spend a whole day there.

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,000
There's lots of exciting things that we're talking about and we're going to get a lot of

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,640
feedback about how the pod shows have been doing and just a lot of good stuff, which

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,120
of course will report on on the second.

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,120
Is that my?

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,480
Already someone trying to really on the blackberry, my goodness, but I just wanted to start

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,840
the show off with a couple of words.

16
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:15,880
I really wanted to say how incredibly proud I am to be a member of the podcast community.

17
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:24,120
For all the differences of opinions we have regarding many different aspects of our craft,

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:35,400
of our business, of our talents, of our emotions, our criticisms, our flaws, all of it,

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,920
all the differences that we have and all the things that we sometimes get into very heated

20
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,920
debate about.

21
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:50,480
It has been so beautiful to see just the complete outpouring of love for a fellow podcaster,

22
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,560
who suffered a great loss in our personal life in the past week.

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:04,560
This has been the personal tragedy has really been going on for several months and I've

24
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,400
been very, I guess it's close to it as I could have been.

25
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,720
Just to see how everyone has put all these differences and opinions and all that crap behind

26
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,360
them.

27
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,960
I'll probably get to the comment later on as I go through my Gmail on the show today, but

28
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,520
I think it was robbed from top of the pods in the UK who sent me just a beautiful email

29
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:42,800
and he said, how amazing it is that if what had happened, the passing of a loved one had

30
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,560
happened to a celebrity in the, quote, mainstream world, paparazzi would have been, you know,

31
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,320
trying to get horrible pictures and trying to trump up the drama story and really the media just

32
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,640
feeds like a frenzy on that stuff. And in pod casting, which of course is the new media, we're

33
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,240
seeing something completely different and so beautiful. First of all, the fact that magic would

34
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:15,280
even do a podcast at this time, this time in our life and everything that's going on.

35
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,520
And last night, I was literally awake until three in the morning just listening to the the most recent

36
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:28,160
East radio is such a incredibly brave thing that she did and just poured all that love right back to

37
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:36,080
us again. How we've responded, how we reacted really, really, really makes me believe that human

38
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:43,840
scenes definitely can be good. So I wanted to play a song from the pod set music network,

39
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,600
which just popped up and seemed so appropriate. It's a good day.

40
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:14,400
I'm going to talk about the bad day of my friend, all the fact that we are here,

41
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:27,600
that makes today a good day, a good day, a good day, a good day. We've got this time to rise and

42
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,200
shine just another day in this life of mine and take up a deep breath. My lungs still took

43
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,240
past these. We got to be a good day. We got to have to be stretched out. My arms, eyes,

44
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,760
hail out, my worries. We too bananas. No end with the possibilities. These are mine, it feels

45
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,960
my bloodline. Never so becomes cold as I swing from the fire in my concern with time.

46
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,920
I finally feel fine, days as it should be of my own design. There's no alarm clock.

47
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,520
He knew when I'll rest, sleep and dream mine, to Katie and rhythm's all.

48
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,720
All that I need and I introduce a bad day and I'm on choose to be because you can have a good day

49
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,320
unless you believe. Every day good and bad will be around. So let's focus on listening to the

50
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:18,880
path that it sounds a little bit higher. I'm going to talk about the bad day of my friend,

51
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:27,920
all the fact that we are here, that makes today a good day.

52
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:46,600
So let's talk about the bad day in my breath, all the fact that we are here, that makes

53
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:54,080

all the fact that we are here, that makes today a good day.

65
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:26,160
So let's talk about the bad day of my breath, all the fact that we are here, that makes today a good day of my breath, all the fact that we are here,

66

all the fact that we are here, that makes today a good day of my breath, all the fact that we are here, that makes today a good day of my breath,

71
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:27,160
just several times that we have a lot of work to do on helping the marketers and advertisers who are interested in working with podcasters and other independent producers,

72
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:37,160
help them understand the same monumental shift that we have already gotten used to and are still seeing happening before a very eyes,

73
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:51,160
there is still a lot of what I call a lot of, I used to call like, we call my God, coffee television,

74
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,160
coffee television means when someone is talking about coffee, then you see a cup of coffee on the screen,

75
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:06,160
and for advertising, it is like, well, if we are going to advertise, what is a good example,

76
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:18,160
medicine, then we have to go to medical websites, where now that we have this extremely relevant conversation that podcasters are having with their audience,

77
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:27,160
you know, we need to look way, way, way beyond that, and I have gotten actual offers for sponsorship of the metro sexual moment,

78
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:36,160
I tried out the, I did try out the Gillette Fusion this morning, and God, those guys, I mean,

79
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:43,160
I guess it does make a difference, the difference between three blades and five blades makes it tremendous difference,

80
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:52,160
so as I said, I really don't have anything prepared, but just to kind of talk to you about some of the stuff that I've been learning,

81
00:11:52,160 --> 00:12:05,160
last night had a great little hang with Andrew, Andrew is half a rocket boom, if you have not seen this video podcast, then you are missing out on something incredibly exciting,

82
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:14,160
rocket boom.com, Amanda, is the host of the show, but she also works behind the scenes with her business partner Andrew,

83
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:21,160
how they met and everything is just a story by itself, and it was great, we shared some Valentine lobster,

84
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:30,160
which was being served in the hotel lobby like snobbs, but wow, what an interesting guy, and what an interesting project,

85
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:38,160
and just to hear all the thought that has gone into into this and the history behind it was absolutely fascinating,

86
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:48,160
and as I go through my Gmail inbox here, which, by the way, is totally filling up again, let me just see some of the things we got here,

87
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:59,160
right off the bat, what is this, from Tony McNamara, and I have not heard any of these, because I have about 80 different pieces of audio feedback,

88
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:08,160
sitting in my source code in mohux, rocket boom, auction and shaving oil, and century burgers, now that sounds like something I need to listen to.

89
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,160
Hi Adam, blog it here, by now you've seen that rocket boom's eBay auction went from 15,000 to 40,000,

90
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:22,160
basically overnight, right as the auction closed, that's how eBay auctions always go, I thought I'd let you know that that's because everybody uses a sniping tool,

91
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:29,160
which is designed to allow you to put in your auction value at the very last second so that nobody else can see it and decide they really want to spend more.

92
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,160
It helps keep the prices down, on the meta-sexual front, I don't consider myself a meta-sexual,

93
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:43,160
but I do use the art of shaving oil after you wash before you shave to reduce razor burn, and it is fantastic.

94
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:51,160
And lastly, I'm a lapsed VFR pilot, I like century burgers, which was when you rent an airplane and fly from one city to another,

95
00:13:51,160 --> 00:14:00,160
like Los Angeles to Santa Barbara, get yourself a hamburger with some friends, and then fly back, the total thing cost you about a hundred dollars due to plain rental,

96
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:07,160
and any house, so I am a qualified pilot, and I can wish you well and say thanks for the great shows, and hey, tailwinds!

97
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:14,160
That's right, that's so funny, only mention that once or twice that I felt that you can only say tailwinds if you're a pilot,

98
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,160
and now I get all these people saying, well listen, my dad was a pilot, so I think I can say tailwinds, okay?

99
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,160
So tailwinds back at your buddy, thank you very much.

100
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:31,160
Yes, indeed, saw that, and in addition to that, and this is just fantastic, and I promise you that these changes were coming,

101
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,160
EarthLink has purchased a second week of sponsorship on Rocket Boom.

102
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:46,160
EarthLink, the company that you know, started supporting podcasting a couple months ago, primarily on the Pod Show Podcast Network,

103
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:53,160
and through your feedback, and again, we promised that we would be sharing all of this with everyone that we're working with,

104
00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:01,160
they have now completely gone in the direction that we have been pointing them.

105
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:08,160
And in this case, very much, and I'm really speaking on behalf of the daily source code in this case,

106
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,160
they want to give it a try, they want to give this user-generated advertising,

107
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,160
because just basically what we've been talking about, want to give it a try.

108
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,160
And let's see if we can come up with some great advertising that sticks, and of course, you're going to be creating it.

109
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:29,160
You, audience, hello, podcasters, listeners, fellow countrymen, and enemies alike.

110
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:37,160
You're going to be judging it, and after a quick conversation with Chris, and we won't actually start with this until, until March.

111
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:44,160
So we have a little time to prepare for it, but the idea is that you give us the best commercial.

112
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,160
The winner will actually go into rotation, and we'll get a prize for that, which will include cash,

113
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,160
just like you actually worked in the business.

114
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,160
Oh my gosh, guess what, it's working.

115
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,160
We're able to sustain ourselves.

116
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,160
And I said, you know, start thinking about it, start thinking about if you want to participate, what you want to do.

117
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,160
This is your chance, and I'm looking for a lot of names who said that this was really wrong.

118
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:17,160
I'm looking for you to really provide some input here, whether it's on the creative side or on the judging side, et cetera.

119
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,160
And somehow, I'm going to have to figure out how to produce all this stuff and get it all in there.

120
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,160
But immediately, it was a Jennifer Navarret, Navarretti Navarretti.

121
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:32,160
From the morning brew cast, sent me an email.

122
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,160
Well, here's our take on a podcaster ad for Earthlink again.

123
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
I've not heard it.

124
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:43,160
Let me just actually open it up here, and literally opening these files as we speak from Gmail.

125
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,160
And let's see what this is.

126
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
Okay.

127
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
It's coming.

128
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
Hi, Adam.

129
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
This is Jennifer with the morning brew cast.

130
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,160
I was listening to DSC334 in reference to podcaster Earthlink commercials.

131
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,160
My husband, John and I took up the challenge and have recorded our own Earthlink commercial.

132
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,160
Do you believe anything is possible?

133
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
We do.

134
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,160
We're actually...

135
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
Ugh.

136
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
Thank goodness.

137
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
What's wrong, don't you like Earthlink?

138
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
Well, of course I do.

139
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,160
I've had high-speed internet service with Earthlink for over three years.

140
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,160
And I even have their phone service.

141
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,160
It's just that I'm so tired of those same commercials.

142
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,160
Well, how are they supposed to let people know about their service if they don't run commercials?

143
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
Well, they could ask me.

144
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,160
I'm a satisfied Earthlink customer.

145
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,160
I'll be glad to tell them all about it.

146
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,160
Like I've never had a look at trouble with their service.

147
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
Yeah, right.

148
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,160
Do you imagine who wouldn't call in you about Earthlink?

149
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
Alright.

150
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
And the editing done with the...

151
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
With cut and paste, I guess.

152
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
Fantastic.

153
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Thank you.

154
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,160
One thing I have learned from this is the repetitiveness of commercials.

155
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,160
Where in traditional media, that works really, really well because let's face it.

156
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,160
So you're not listening to a radio state to the same station 24 hours a day.

157
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:05,160
So in a 24-hour period, an advertiser may throw out, I'll just pick a number, maybe 50 commercials.

158
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,160
The chance that you're going to hear it is maybe once and maybe the volume will be really soft.

159
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:17,160
And you know, then maybe the second time you hear it, the Dutolim Dume of Earthlink will catch you for a second.

160
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,160
You know, it could be any number of times.

161
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,160
But you know, that repetition basically starts to grab your attention and maybe it's a hook, maybe it's funny,

162
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,160
or maybe it's a product that you're thinking of, of thinking of buying.

163
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:39,160
And then it all starts to come together, but on a podcast where, you know, the serialized nature of it is you're probably going to listen to, you know,

164
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,160
listen to the podcast regularly.

165
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,160
And if the advertiser is like playing the same song over and over because you'd hear it over and over.

166
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,160
It's like playing the same promo over and over.

167
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,160
Man, I get enough comments.

168
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,160
Just to my opener, please, it wouldn't mind you sending me some more cool ones.

169
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,160
So that's, that's just something that definitely does not work.

170
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,160
This, this got to be at least variation otherwise.

171
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,160
It's just mind numbing completely mind numbing.

172
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,160
So that's a big takeaway from what we're learning here in podcasting.

173
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,160
Let me just see if there's, oh yeah, what was this?

174
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,160
You have a new booty call message.

175
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,160
This is probably span.

176
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,160
Now it is too bad.

177
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
Ah, darn it all.

178
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,160
Let me see if we got any good stuff here.

179
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Sanvertizing promo.

180
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Are you at risk?

181
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
Mm-hmm.

182
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,160
Let me see how my goodness,

183
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,160
a new song, Danish cartoons.

184
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,160
Well, I really don't feel like doing any of that.

185
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
Nothing from Roger Smalls yet.

186
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,160
I'm really missing some, oh, what's this?

187
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,160
You're so innocent.

188
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
Something about Roger.

189
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
Oh, that's interesting.

190
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,160
Just listening to the Valentine's edition of Delhi source code.

191
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,160
Love the fact that Roger's ringtone is getting itself out there.

192
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,160
And without the need for a million dollars worth of advertising and MTV,

193
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,160
we've worked a lot on ringtones and our projects to open up the mobile phone

194
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
in terms of content.

195
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
This is interesting.

196
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,160
It's www.c21tones.

197
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:19,160
And you can actually find the ring, the Roger Smalls ringtone there.

198
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
And it's free.

199
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,160
Of course, your normal network connection charges apply.

200
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,160
And it seems like there's something very interesting there.

201
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,160
www.c21tones.com.

202
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,160
Now I can play another song.

203
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,160
I'm going to keep it relatively short as I said.

204
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,160
It's funny.

205
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
In the time it takes to FTP.

206
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,160
All of the pod shows off to serious.

207
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,160
We could probably grab a cab and take a couple CDs.

208
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
And do it that way.

209
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,160
Oh, and there's also, oh, wow, this is really exciting.

210
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,160
I got a pretty serious interest.

211
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,160
And I think we're actually going to be able to get a bio diesel sponsor to come in

212
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,160
and start working with us.

213
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,160
And maybe sponsoring some segments and getting some more information out there.

214
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,160
You know me and the Trinity and the biodiesel.

215
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,160
Okay.

216
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,160
So we just do one promo then.

217
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,160
Let's do one promo.

218
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,160
Let's see.

219
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,160
What do we have here?

220
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,160
Man, it's over to promo.

221
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
This is horrible.

222
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,160
I'm glad we're going to keep this short one.

223
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,160
Come on.

224
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
Come on.

225
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
Come on.

226
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,160
Here it is.

227
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,160
Okay.

228
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,160
Let's listen to that then.

229
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,160
And then we'll play a song or two and we'll get out of here.

230
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,160
Oh, man.

231
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,160
This is coming from libson.

232
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,160
See, this is what I go through when I prepare the show.

233
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,160
I have to find all these things.

234
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,160
Then I have to download it when I wait for them.

235
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,160
Mmm.

236
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,160
But better.

237
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,160
I don't leave me.

238
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
I'll be getting her.

239
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,160
It's just a couple of guys talking shit.

240
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,160
Oh, man.

241
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,160
My name's not really Frank.

242
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:14,160
Who puts the odd impod in the ass in cast.

243
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,160
The Frank way to podcast.

244
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,160
This makes it feel like it's nice to be alive.

245
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Try pulling a rusty needle out of your vein.

246
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
Now that's hard.

247
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
That's tough.

248
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
Insightful.

249
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,160
I'm going to spank your tongue with my penis.

250
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,160
Feel a hot sauce in the dirt.

251
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,160
Start.

252
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,160
Have a bone or all night.

253
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,160
Loose two hours of your life every week.

254
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,160
There are some jackasses that wish just mute us.

255
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,160
They're not only a revenant.

256
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,160
They're irrelevant.

257
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,160
We've lost all of our list.

258
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,160
Frank way to podcast.

259
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,160
Visit frankwit.com to listen to and or subscribe to the show.

260
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,160
It's fun like cancer.

261
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
Oh, that's stupid.

262
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,160
Oh, you guys are horrible.

263
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,160
Oh, man.

264
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,160
Now that's what I get for Jesus Christ.

265
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,160
That's what I see.

266
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,160
And you wonder why not all promos get played.

267
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,160
God darn it.

268
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
All right.

269
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,160
Those of you who enjoyed that lovely moment on serious stars 103.

270
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,160
Looks like we're going to be moving channels pretty soon.

271
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,160
I think we're moving even closer to God.

272
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,160
That's right.

273
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,160
We're going from I think 103 to 102.

274
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
And then 101 is Howard.

275
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,160
So we're almost there.

276
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,160
We're moving up in the world, everybody.

277
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,160
Those of you who are wondering what the heck is going on.

278
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,160
And if you only hang this for the first time as you scan through your 120 channels worth of entertainment,

279
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,160
this is podcasting.

280
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,160
This is where everything goes.

281
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,160
And if you want to hear the full experience, if you really want to feel it,

282
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,160
then feel free to come over to podshow.com.

283
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,160
And if you want to come directly to this show daily source code.com.

284
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:03,160
And that's we can download the entire show because we do continue after you all listening to Pacific Coast

285
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,160
Hellway.

286
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,160
And we'll have another match.

287
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,160
I think one to wisdom is going to be filling in once again.

288
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,160
I'd probably for the rest of this week.

289
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,160
Send me feedback if you're in your car.

290
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,160
And you think of it later on when you get home.

291
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,160
Adam at curie.com.

292
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,160
And again, daily source code.com where you can find new episodes of this show.

293
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:26,160
The extended versions of what you didn't hear in your motor vehicle.

294
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,160
Sidelight window closing for you guys.

295
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,160
I'll see you tomorrow.

296
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,160
PCH is next.

297
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,160
And let's wrap it up.

298
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,160
I have a whole bunch of really fun stuff that I'll be able to do tomorrow.

299
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,160
I want a little bit more rested.

300
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,160
And that'll be just before I go home.

301
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,160
So, oh shoot.

302
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
And then Friday.

303
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,160
Well, I want to Friday when I can't be able to do a show.

304
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,160
I've completed exactly what we needed to do this week.

305
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,160
So, final song comes from the Podsafe Music Network.

306
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,160
Just a nice, happy, diddy.

307
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
Easy car.

308
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Easy car.

309
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,160
New head.

310
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,160
New shoes.

311
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,160
Ran new dress.

312
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,160
I've got a new attitude.

313
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,160
Got a pocket full of money.

314
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,160
I'm made and laid down.

315
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,160
Watch out if I bite.

316
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,160
I'm down.

317
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,160
That's right.

318
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,160
Easy car.

319
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,160
