We don't need noss.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,840
Thinking transmere?

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,480
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,760
Podcasting is an Adam Curry.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,120
And so I've had a way that I only want the stars to give.

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,480
And she goes high, baby, cold.

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,720
And I want the wife, baby, here.

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:07,320
And some girls are on the face, and I know just how to be here.

16
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:16,760
And so I've found my days that I only got more cold here.

17
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,760
And I'm thinking to be so much more than I hold on me.

18
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
Ready?

19
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,760
How much more can you take?

20
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,760
Let's go!

21
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:49,080
And so I've got my way that I only want the stars to give.

22
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,880
And she goes high, baby, cold.

23
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,200
And I want the wife, baby, here.

24
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:08,440
I think in today, it's so much more than I hold on me.

25
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,480
The way how much more can you take?

26
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,920
I think in today, it's so much more than I hold on me.

27
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,960
The way I much more can you take?

28
00:02:43,480 --> 00:03:11,320
I think in today, it's so much more than I hold on me.

29
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,360
Ready?

30
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,000
How much more can you take?

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,200
Let's go!

32
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:23,240
And I think in today, it's so much more than I hold on me.

33
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,680
The way I much more can you take?

34
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:36,040
I think in today, it's so much more than I hold on me.

35
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:47,320
I've got to get on something like cowbell action.

36
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,560
The cowbell song brought to you by years of static kicking off another week of the daily

37
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
source code.

38
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Hi, everybody.

39
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,320
Adam Curry coming to you from the Curry Cottage in the affluent suburb of Surrey

40
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,640
known as Guilford Beautiful Day today.

41
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,560
Start off a little bit hazy, but of course, can't complain because we had an even more

42
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,760
beautiful weekend, which I'll tell you all about.

43
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:14,360
It was jam-packed somewhat hectic at times and involved a lot of travel and lodging stuff.

44
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,440
Always something interesting happened, I'll tell you about that.

45
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,760
By the way, thanks to Yifthach Levy, who said, I don't hope this message finds you well,

46
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,400
we're searching for music to add to the first episode of my own show today.

47
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,360
I came across the cowbell song by years of static, which I think you'll love.

48
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:36,360
It seems like Yifthach is getting ready for his own podcast, which will be located

49
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,480
at HowDueJew.com.

50
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,280
I think I've talked about Yifthach before, or maybe he sent an audio comment or something,

51
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,080
but I recognize it.

52
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:53,080
Oh, man, I've got a whole new set up, so I'm a little bit distracted, a little discombobulated

53
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,560
if you will, because when you've got your studio and your set up or studio, we've got

54
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,640
all your gear set up and everything is just so, and then you change stuff and you have

55
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,320
different boxes and different devices, it gets a little harrowing at times.

56
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,960
I'm not going to tell you exactly what happened.

57
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,320
I just want to stay with a wheel, of course, but now, right now, I just want to stay with

58
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,640
the cowbell vibe, because it seems like people are back on a cowbell trip.

59
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,040
I wonder if my cowbelling has anything to do with it.

60
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:27,320
Tom Morris sent a track that he thought I might want to add to my cowbell predilection.

61
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,320
Yes, what?

62
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,320
What?

63
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
I got a fever.

64
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,320
I got a fever.

65
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
I got a fever.

66
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
I got a fever.

67
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
I got a fever.

68
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
Yeah.

69
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
It's, uh, what is it called?

70
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,320
It's, uh, who does this thing?

71
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,320
I'll put a link to it in the show notes.

72
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:49,320
It wasn't exactly the kind of track that I would go for, but it had, of course, the required

73
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,320
cowbell voice drops in there, so, very cool.

74
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Thank you very much, dude.

75
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:01,320
Before the weekend, we kicked off, uh, really here in the, in the cottage, we kicked off all

76
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,320
of the festivities, if you will.

77
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,320
With, uh, Christina's very first podcast, pod save the queen.

78
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,320
And, uh, I have to say, it was phenomenal.

79
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,320
It was absolutely, I was blown away.

80
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Not just so you have a little bit of, of history as to how this came about.

81
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,320
I've been asking Christina and people, you know, listeners to the Charlie been listening,

82
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Christina, I haven't asking Christina if she would ever start her podcast, which she alluded to.

83
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:37,320
Now, she's, um, 15 going on 16, and this is the, uh, the year I think around October.

84
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,320
So, actually, when she's 16, there you go.

85
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,320
She can actually start doing part-time work, and very typical for, um,

86
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:50,320
15 to 16 year old girls here in Guilford is, to go work at, uh, the barber shop or the

87
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,320
hair salon, Tony and guy, uh, or maybe work at top shop or just anywhere you can

88
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,320
get a Saturday in part-time gig.

89
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,320
And, uh, so I, you know, kept here in Christina,

90
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,320
talk about her friends who were where they were working.

91
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:10,320
I said, you know, there is a real opportunity for you if you want to make some money, uh,

92
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,320
by doing a podcast because I'm pretty sure that it would be, it would work.

93
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,320
It would be popular, it would be successful.

94
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,320
And, uh, somehow the, the quarter finally dropped and she said, okay, I'll do it.

95
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,320
And she said that, uh, was it Friday when Patricia and I were doing the show.

96
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,320
And she came up and she was ready right after we were done.

97
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,320
She had her MP3 files, which she'd emailed to me.

98
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,320
She had all kinds of notes, which were bullet points, because I did kind of

99
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,320
cheat a little peek there, but it was all bullet points.

100
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,320
And, um, and, you know, I just hit record and off she went.

101
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,320
And I could, and a lot of people actually emailed and say or left comments and said that,

102
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,320
um, I was, my presence was too prevalent, but I couldn't help it.

103
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,320
I was just sitting, I was, I, I, my mic was not on.

104
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,320
She had the mic that Patricia normally uses.

105
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
I just couldn't help laughing.

106
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,320
I was funny.

107
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:02,320
And I was just blown away by how he, how, how easily she slipped right into it.

108
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
It was fantastic.

109
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,320
So podsavethequeen.com is where we can find Christina's podcast.

110
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,320
And I guess she'll be doing one, um, once a week, you know, to kind of ease

111
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
into it.

112
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,320
Although she was already talking about, well, maybe I could do a different show with

113
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
this person.

114
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,320
Why don't we just take it slowly and she's already in contact with the,

115
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,320
with her listeners, with her audience and helping her on the website and getting everything

116
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,320
set up podsavethequeen.com.

117
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
You know what?

118
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,320
I'm a proud popper.

119
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,320
I got to tell you it very proud.

120
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,320
So then Saturday, um, had a trip planned to go see my mom.

121
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,320
As you know, I think, you know, she's in the hospital.

122
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
She's been there for two weeks.

123
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,320
Um, and the main reason was, she, her, her general condition,

124
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,320
a, a interior, a deteriorated significantly.

125
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
So they need to do a couple things.

126
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
And the main thing is pain management.

127
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,320
And you just can't do that, you know, with a visit to the doctor and then coming back

128
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,320
two or three days later and saying, well, this work, this didn't work.

129
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,320
It really has to happen under supervision.

130
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,320
And so she's got a team of great doctors, um, who are on the pain management team,

131
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,320
led by this one guy, uh, who, uh, my mom calls a Pablo Escobar.

132
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
I call him the candy man.

133
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
And, uh, they're doing it.

134
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,320
They, they figured out the right mix of, gosh, I don't know what the hell it is.

135
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,320
I mean, variance and pretness on and caution is what.

136
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Uh, but it's working because I saw her on Saturday and she looked phenomenal.

137
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
She's ready to leave the hospital now.

138
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,320
Um, of course, now she's in this, in this very interesting fight because, you know,

139
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,320
they have, uh, detected more cancer that has to be, uh, that has to be

140
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
new, essentially.

141
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,320
But since she just, you know, her most recent radio therapy was, was pretty recent.

142
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,320
Uh, they just have to wait.

143
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,320
You know, otherwise you fry someone up if you just keep, keep blasting him with radio therapy.

144
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,320
So the only way that clears up, of course, is through a natural process.

145
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,320
And if your general health is, is good, then it, of course, the healing goes much faster.

146
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,320
So she's in this very interesting race where, you know, she feels much better every day,

147
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,320
yet she knows that, you know, on the inside, uh, there's deterioration, deterioration.

148
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
Uh, the shit is eating her up.

149
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,320
Just put it that way.

150
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:21,320
Um, but to man, she was in great spirits, um, eating like a dock worker.

151
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,320
We even sat outside on, uh, on the hospital balcony.

152
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
And yeah, it was just good.

153
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,320
Of course, the visiting hours are much later than normal.

154
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
So I booked the, the Rotterdam Airport hotel.

155
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
There's one.

156
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Only, it's not a very big airport, but it's an international airport.

157
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Uh, for, um, I think they could take, uh, the, I think the 737 is the biggest,

158
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
uh, aircraft aircraft they can take.

159
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,320
So we left, uh, the Delta Sheriff there overnight had a great flight, by the way.

160
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,320
It was, uh, man, even though, because the weather, when it's warm, you get a lot more

161
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,320
thermals, and you get a lot more turbulence when you're, uh, see below, below three and a half

162
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
thousand feet.

163
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,320
It was pretty bumpy, but then we went up over the channel, flight level 555, five and a half

164
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,320
thousand feet.

165
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
And it was like the, like the plane was on rails, man.

166
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,320
It was just smooth, gliding, and the weather was beautiful.

167
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
So that was really nice.

168
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,320
Um, now I, uh, so I, I booked the hotel.

169
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,320
I booked the hotel for myself and for a captain Dan, who, of course, still flies within

170
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,320
the all the time, as my safety pilot.

171
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Um, because otherwise, you know, we would've had to come back after hours.

172
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,320
It could've gotten dark, you know, you know, it's just, what differences

173
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,320
to make?

174
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
I figured we just leave Sunday morning.

175
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,320
So of course, Saturday night, we had the grand opening of the pod show palace

176
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,320
and the casino in, uh, second life.

177
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,320
And now as you know, my Mac fried, my power book, which was my primary

178
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,320
machine, which I had really run everything off of.

179
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,320
So the only other machine I had that, uh, that I could take with me was the, uh,

180
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,320
to sheep, a portage a laptop.

181
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,320
Excuse me, since I'm, which runs, uh, cast blaster, which I use all the time,

182
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,320
basically just for production purposes for the show for you running cast blaster.

183
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,320
So I loaded the second life on to it.

184
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,320
Interestingly enough, and if you don't know what second life is, go to secondlife.com.

185
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,320
But if you listen to this show, if you're listening from more than four episodes, you do.

186
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
It's, uh, I guess it's a game.

187
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
It's a virtual world.

188
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,320
It's, uh, it's a place to go.

189
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
It's a place to do things.

190
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
And basically hook up with people.

191
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,320
That was the whole point of the pod show palace, uh, and the grand opening.

192
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,320
So I have to say that second life runs a hell of a lot faster.

193
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,320
The, the resin and just everything works seemingly much faster, which is pretty,

194
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
pretty interesting to me.

195
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,320
Now this hotel, which is a golden tulip, the Rotterdam Airport hotel.

196
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Um, it's small, you know, it has, I think, 90 rooms.

197
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,320
In fact, before it was a hotel that was used as a, uh,

198
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,320
asylum-seeker detention place.

199
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,320
So it kind of has a whole bunch of smaller rooms.

200
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,320
Um, and what they, even though the rooms are fine, you know, it's, uh,

201
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,320
it's, it's perfect business hotel.

202
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
They don't have Wi-Fi in the rooms.

203
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,320
In fact, there was no connectivity in the rooms.

204
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,320
But in the bar and in the lobby, there's Wi-Fi, which is that Swisscom crap that,

205
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,320
oh, man, which cost you like 18 bucks for an hour or something,

206
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,320
totally ridiculous.

207
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
But so no problem.

208
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
I figured I'd go downstairs.

209
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,320
The lobby's really is quite nice, and I kind of sat in the corner,

210
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,320
so I had power for the, for the laptop, and, you know, I hopped on.

211
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,320
And, and now, uh, earlier, because we had, we had dinner in the hotel.

212
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
We noticed that a whole bunch of people were going upstairs,

213
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,320
and it sounded like a wedding or some other kind of party was going on.

214
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,320
And so now around, I don't know, one, thirty, one, forty, five.

215
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,320
You know, I'm popping back and forth, talking to people.

216
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,320
I've got my virtual Tuxedo on in second life for the opening, and, you know,

217
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
there's just all kinds of stuff going on.

218
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
So I'm pretty much focused on the screen, but of certain,

219
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,320
I can, I can feel, I can sense that people are, like,

220
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,320
near me in my vicinity, if you will, like, had a, a radar,

221
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,320
and I can, you know, kind of sense that, and I think they're looking at me.

222
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,320
Now, remember, Patricia and I are pretty well known in the Netherlands.

223
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,320
So even though I had my head down, it was kind of buried in my work,

224
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,320
I could tell that people were recognizing me, and, you know,

225
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,320
then, then, of course, they'll start to make comments.

226
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,320
And I even said, hey, you know, I'm, I'm just working here,

227
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,320
you know, trying to give them the hint that I was actually doing something

228
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,320
that was productive, and I didn't really want to be disturbed.

229
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,320
It didn't matter, because the people who were there had come from this,

230
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,320
what I thought was a wedding party upstairs.

231
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,320
It was a 55 plus singles night.

232
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,320
So you can only imagine that around 130, quarter to two,

233
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,320
everyone was pretty tanked up and horny, and it was quite frightening.

234
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Let me tell you, because as a whole bunch of old horny guys,

235
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,320
and I'll just say that they were well over 55.

236
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,320
And then there was, you know, some spring chickens probably around 55.

237
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,320
And they saw me, and they were like, very interested in me,

238
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,320
and it got, I actually almost had to run for my life.

239
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,320
And it was like 100 of them.

240
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,320
And, you know, as soon as I could, and, you know, they want to take pictures

241
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,320
and rub my ass and whatever, and I ran back to my room,

242
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
and I figured, you know, I'll wait for a little while.

243
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
And I checked it, like, at 2.15, 2.30,

244
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,320
and was still jam packed down there, so I like screw it.

245
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,320
And then the next day, we had to fly back,

246
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,320
so, you know, off to the jet center, where the lovely Delta Sheriff was standing,

247
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
waiting in the flew back, and there was an air show,

248
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,320
big and hill, so it was just a very,

249
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,320
a tiring weekend, let's just put it that way.

250
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,320
But it was fun, and it was great to see that my mom was doing so well.

251
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
So, at all, be able to visit her,

252
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,320
want to visit her Saturday, and then I think Tuesday,

253
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
it's off to San Francisco again,

254
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
this time probably for two weeks.

255
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,320
So, due to the crash of the power book, and yeah,

256
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,320
I'm going to take it back, or send it back.

257
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,320
I haven't decided if I'm going to send it, I think goes to Ireland,

258
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,320
or I'll just take it back to the store in San Francisco.

259
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,320
I, of course, I had my outline, my omni outline,

260
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
where the whole bunch of voicemail feedback,

261
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,320
and promo is all kinds of stuff.

262
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,320
And so, it's still on the machine, it's on the drive,

263
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,320
I just can't get to it.

264
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
And so, if you want to hook me up,

265
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,320
and give me some more good feedback,

266
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,320
or repeat whatever you sent in over the past week.

267
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,320
Voice mail numbers for the US in New Jersey,

268
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,320
201-625-635-7, or in,

269
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,320
or our number in London,

270
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
with someone correctly pointed out,

271
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
do you only want people from London now,

272
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
is for anyone to call, of course,

273
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
I'm just giving you a choice of numbers.

274
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,320
O2O-7-6A-1375-3.

275
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,320
Hi, Adam, Kelly Muller.

276
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
I just like to thank you for playing my song

277
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
on your great pod show.

278
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
It means an awful lot to me.

279
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
Thank you.

280
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
It's an honor.

281
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
Thank you, bye.

282
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,320
That was, it was Kelly Muller,

283
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
that was a demo song.

284
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,320
Was it, would we play that?

285
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
Did I play that?

286
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,320
Shoot, let me, let me just see.

287
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,320
I wasn't expecting that one to pop up,

288
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,320
actually.

289
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Hold on, let me just see,

290
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
when did I play her?

291
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
I think that was actually,

292
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,320
it was something that was listed as a demo.

293
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
See, I'm now in the pod safe music network,

294
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
and it makes it real easy to go find it.

295
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
Kelly Muller there it is.

296
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,320
You're a word.

297
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,320
Let me just remind ourselves

298
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
what that song was like,

299
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
since she was so nice to call in.

300
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
Yeah, she's from the UK, right, right, right, right, right,

301
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,320
or was it.

302
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,320
It was,

303
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,320
it's not me now.

304
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,320
More than a dream,

305
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,320
crap.

306
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,320
Sorry, bear with me, let me see if I can,

307
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,320
okay, at least the computer's working.

308
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,320
Your words, that's what it was, okay,

309
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,320
I'm looking at my playlist now

310
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
on the pod safe music network,

311
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,320
here we go.

312
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,320
So I guess we can just play this straight from the page, right?

313
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,320
Here we go.

314
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
Let's just see what that was again.

315
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
Is it working?

316
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
Anything?

317
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,320
Any sounds?

318
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
Yeah.

319
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
Oh, that's right.

320
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
Oh, man.

321
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,320
Yeah, that was the drip drip drop drip drip song.

322
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
Awesome.

323
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,320
Very cool.

324
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,320
Okay, I guess I should tell you why it sounds

325
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
a little disjointed today.

326
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
So I've made a decision.

327
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,320
First of all,

328
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,320
thank you all so much for trying to help out

329
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,320
with the power book.

330
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
I have no idea what it is.

331
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,320
You know, people have given me the power

332
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,320
management unit reset sequence.

333
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,320
I actually tried to boot from the CD

334
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
or the DVD I think it is.

335
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,320
That's always a good one

336
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
because if you put it in

337
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
the CD, it will try and boot up from.

338
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
But now of course the keyboard doesn't seem to be working.

339
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,320
So it's not recognizing the DVD to boot up from the drive

340
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,320
and the only way to have it eject upon startup

341
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,320
is hold down the mouse button, which of course

342
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,320
also isn't working.

343
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,320
So now it's, I'm even further from where I was when I started

344
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,320
and it's not booting up at all.

345
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,320
And you know, and I have to work.

346
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,320
I just need to, I need to get my stuff moving.

347
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
And some theories about why this has happened.

348
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,320
It's my third fried power book in any year.

349
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,320
Wants me left something on the on the curry.com message

350
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
boards.

351
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,320
Maybe it's the voltage in the UK,

352
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,320
which apparently is significantly higher than the

353
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,320
listed 220 to 230 volts.

354
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
I don't know.

355
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
It doesn't sound right to me.

356
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,320
I think it's going through the transformer

357
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,320
and the transformer's outputting.

358
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,320
Not AC, but a DC power supply.

359
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,320
So I don't, I don't think that that's it.

360
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,320
But it was getting really, really hot.

361
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,320
Particularly when I was using second life.

362
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,320
And so, you know, I fell asleep with the,

363
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
when it was still working.

364
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,320
Right after we got back from San Francisco

365
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
and I woke up and it was frying.

366
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,320
It was roasting my nuts.

367
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,320
Michael Musiel says,

368
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,320
what we often do to save the old jewels

369
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,320
is to use an old bean bag.

370
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,320
Was it bean bag backed lap desk?

371
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,320
The flat surface of the lap desk

372
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,320
was ideal to set the lap top on.

373
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,320
It allows air to get under the lap top

374
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
and let the fans do their thing.

375
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,320
Yeah, it's really because the fan can't blow it away.

376
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,320
Hmm, I like this other thing though.

377
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,320
That was sent to me.

378
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,320
Emanroke, the chill pack.

379
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,320
It's very, it's an ice pack.

380
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,320
You put underneath your, your power book or your i-box.

381
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,320
I don't know, your i-book or your MacBook, I guess.

382
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,320
Only 20 bucks.

383
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,320
What do you have to lose?

384
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,320
I'll put a link up on the show notes.

385
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,320
Chill pack with a K.

386
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,320
So I made a decision as I was reading all this

387
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,320
and I'm like, I don't, you know,

388
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,320
I'm so tired of beta testing for Apple.

389
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
I've been doing this for years.

390
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,320
Since the, since, well, the first Mac to,

391
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,320
that I was given, which was a Mac to X,

392
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,320
which Apple loaned me back when they did that.

393
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
That one actually held in for quite a long time,

394
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,320
but I had to give it back to them.

395
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
I believe it or not.

396
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,320
You know, way after after,

397
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,320
it was obsolete practically.

398
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,320
You know, I had the power book audio failure.

399
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,320
And I have to say, you know, when did I get this,

400
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,320
it was the last of the mohicans,

401
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,320
the last Motorola based processor,

402
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,320
which is a 167 gigahertz G4 power book.

403
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,320
I was, I hadn't really mentioned it,

404
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
but I was already quite disappointed

405
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,320
with a couple of pieces of the hardware itself.

406
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,320
Now, first of all, I already discussed about the sound,

407
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,320
which was fixed with software,

408
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,320
but I presume it was some,

409
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,320
some different hardware that had to be fixed with the software hack.

410
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,320
The keys are popping off, you know,

411
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,320
and the same, I think we had this thing for two and a half months.

412
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,320
So, you know, and already though there's the Mac book,

413
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,320
the Mac book pro, and I'm like, I don't get it.

414
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,320
You know, you buy a new machine,

415
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,320
and there's a new one right,

416
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,320
that's announced the next day, it seems,

417
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,320
and I've just got to start to wonder about the quality of the hardware.

418
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,320
I've had drives fail.

419
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
I hear people with optical cable failure.

420
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,320
Now, my keyboard and mouse won't work

421
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,320
at the internal or even through USB.

422
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,320
I'm starting to want to give up.

423
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,320
And so, I did what I usually do in these cases.

424
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,320
Okay, I'm going to migrate to some temporary machine,

425
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,320
so I can at least work.

426
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
And you know, I look around,

427
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,320
like I've got one power book with a fried drive

428
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,320
and a fried screen.

429
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,320
You know, I've got one power book with a fried drive,

430
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,320
running off of a fire wire drive,

431
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
and I've got the most latest power book,

432
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,320
which won't boot up and is fried as I just described.

433
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,320
And then I had the Toshiba.

434
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,320
So I say, you know what, I'll just use the Toshiba for now.

435
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,320
And I discovered that I didn't really have that much to migrate.

436
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,320
The most important migration is really just making sure

437
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,320
that Firefox is installed because my email runs through Gmail.

438
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,320
I use Google's calendar,

439
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,320
which synchronizes perfectly to the blackberry.

440
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,320
Although I just have it sent SMS, you know, a text alerts.

441
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,320
When it's time for a meeting, I would have you for reminders.

442
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,320
Pictures, all I had to do is install a flicker uploader

443
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,320
because I don't store pictures locally anymore.

444
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,320
I hunted around for some simple audio editing stuff.

445
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,320
You know, multi track audio editing found mixed craft,

446
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,320
which seems like it'll work perfectly, you know,

447
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
for if I need to do,

448
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,320
I don't really do a lot of multi track editing,

449
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,320
but if I need to, it's there.

450
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,320
A converter to MP3,

451
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,320
you know, for WAV or AFF to MP3 file conversion,

452
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,320
blaze, media pro or whatever.

453
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,320
You know, just things that will cost me,

454
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,320
you know, if I like them, you know,

455
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,320
wind up paying 29 or 30 bucks for each of these small applications.

456
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,320
But all of my data really lives somewhere else.

457
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,320
And that really made me think about,

458
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,320
you know, what is, what are we really talking about here?

459
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,320
What do I really need?

460
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,320
Now, of course, besides the outlines for,

461
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,320
for the, for my show prep, which arguably,

462
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
I'm sure I could store those online as well,

463
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,320
although I do like kind of having the speed of,

464
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
of those types of files local,

465
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
crap.

466
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,320
Hey, if you're listening to us on a serious stars on 102,

467
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,320
then you want to hear the rest of my fabulous migration story,

468
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
you'll have to go to dailysourcecode.com

469
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,320
to download this podcast.

470
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,320
And, well, while you're probably driving,

471
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
you've got geese radio coming up,

472
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
don and drew Gilmore daily,

473
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,320
DVD weekly.

474
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,320
It's great show, by the way,

475
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,320
DVD weekly, that'll be on at 930 Eastern,

476
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,320
and then a 9 o'clock Eastern, then CC Chapman at 930.

477
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,320
And Mark Yoshimode, an M-Coff,

478
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,320
and the Pacific Coast health players,

479
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,320
are next here on serious,

480
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,320
or there with you on serious,

481
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,320
with Pacific Coast,

482
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
Hellway, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

483
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,320
Okay, so if you're still here,

484
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,320
and you're still interested in this migration story,

485
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,320
I really learned some incredible things.

486
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,320
First of all, I, after, you know,

487
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,320
playing around a little bit with,

488
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,320
and this is a small lap.

489
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
It's very, so I'd weigh,

490
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,320
I don't know, two pounds,

491
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
it's weighs nothing, which is nice,

492
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
and has an enormous four,

493
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
five-hour battery life,

494
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,320
also quite nice,

495
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,320
depending on what you're doing, of course.

496
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,320
I was surprised at things like the scroll speed,

497
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,320
much faster at scrolling windows.

498
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,320
I also, of course, it's partly the screen,

499
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,320
and this is what Apple really does.

500
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,320
Apple makes really beautiful looking products,

501
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,320
and puts a lot of quality pieces into it,

502
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,320
like their displays,

503
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,320
their track pads,

504
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
all of that stuff,

505
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,320
and so they,

506
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,320
it's almost like they,

507
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,320
they finally got the operating system right,

508
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
but, you know,

509
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,320
now they're kind of letting the hardware slip a little bit,

510
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,320
and I guess when I'm realizing now that I'm,

511
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,320
I'm using the wind tail combination of windows,

512
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,320
which, I mean, let's face it,

513
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,320
there's not really that much difference.

514
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
You know, you just have to kind of get,

515
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
even most of the key commands are the same now.

516
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
You know, control W to close a window,

517
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,320
there's no control quit,

518
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
so you do like all F4 or something.

519
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,320
I can get used to that,

520
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,320
and not have been using it for a day and a half.

521
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,320
I'm kind of, you know,

522
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320
already, you know,

523
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,320
I love doing this stuff.

524
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,320
It's almost like driving on the left hand side of the road

525
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,320
here in the UK,

526
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,320
and the right hand side of the car,

527
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,320
it's great for your brain,

528
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,320
you know, it's,

529
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
it makes new neural connections,

530
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
and synapses are firing all over the place.

531
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,320
Yeah, even if you just take a different route to work one day,

532
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,320
that's good,

533
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
that's actually food for your brain.

534
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,320
So I did, I thought,

535
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,320
you know,

536
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,320
maybe you don't make me a little bit smarter.

537
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,320
I'll have more to dumb down with this blifig.

538
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,320
I'm liking it.

539
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,320
I guess that's what I, what I want to say.

540
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,320
Now, of course,

541
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,320
doing the show,

542
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,320
I always have,

543
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,320
as I said,

544
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
cast blaster running on the laptop,

545
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,320
and then I have all my show information,

546
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,320
on the power book,

547
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,320
which I put on a higher shelf level at the podcast complex.

548
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,320
I'm,

549
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
and if you do the show,

550
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,320
you don't even know what that is.

551
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,320
I'll put a link into the picture of the podcast complex.

552
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
The station.

553
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,320
So after I dropped Christina off this morning's school,

554
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,320
I went out,

555
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,320
and I bought a,

556
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
what is this,

557
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,320
an LG monitor?

558
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
So it's a,

559
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,320
19 inch,

560
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,320
19 inch,

561
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
flat screen LCD,

562
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,320
no speakers,

563
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,320
no audio.

564
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
So it's,

565
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,320
it's a very,

566
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
you know,

567
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,320
nicely compact unit.

568
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
Only two wires coming out the back,

569
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,320
no audio cables or anything.

570
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
It's just,

571
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
just it here to provide a beautiful display.

572
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
And I bought a,

573
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
it was a logic tech,

574
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,320
wireless keyboard,

575
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
wireless mouse.

576
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
So that,

577
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
you know,

578
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,320
I would have a full-size keyboard to use,

579
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,320
because the,

580
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,320
the portage,

581
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,320
keyboard is,

582
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
is really quite tiny.

583
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,320
So I hooked it up,

584
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,320
you know,

585
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,320
the extended desktop feature,

586
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,320
which works just like my Mac.

587
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,320
You kind of,

588
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,320
you know,

589
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,320
I had to hunt around for it,

590
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,320
of course to find it.

591
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
And that is really the thing is,

592
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,320
you can really do everything you want,

593
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,320
and,

594
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,320
and create the same type of user experience,

595
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,320
that you would find on a,

596
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,320
on a Mac with a Windows,

597
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
you know,

598
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,320
generic hardware combination.

599
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,320
It's just how they design it,

600
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,320
you know,

601
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,320
all the,

602
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,320
all the API hooks are there.

603
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,320
It's just,

604
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,320
you know,

605
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,320
you know,

606
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,320
you know,

607
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,320
you know,

608
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,320
all mapped out,

609
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,320
and it's not consistently moved from one machine to the other.

610
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,320
But I think I might be able to customize this to actually create the,

611
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,320
you know,

612
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,320
the experience that I want,

613
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,320
and I might even stick with it.

614
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
I don't know.

615
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,320
I'm feeling pretty weird about this.

616
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,320
So I'm going to give it a shot.

617
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,320
Here's what I'll do.

618
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
I'm going to give this a shot,

619
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
at least until,

620
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,320
I can get the Mac,

621
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,320
and I'll take the,

622
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,320
the Mac back to the store on San Francisco and let them deal with it.

623
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,320
I'm just going to live on Windows for a little while.

624
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,320
And hopefully it won't frustrate me too much,

625
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,320
and you'll be along for the ride.

626
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,320
Hi Adam.

627
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
This is Franco from Raka Sitalia,

628
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
and from the Land of Great Motivations,

629
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,320
I can give you some cultural contribution to the Charlie.

630
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,320
I really don't know which credit card you want,

631
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,320
but I assure you,

632
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,320
standard credit card dimensions are not in golden rate.

633
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,320
Standard credit cards are off.

634
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,320
Yeah,

635
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,320
and I've got to set this up.

636
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:12,320
So this was about the conversation I had with the Charles Flasher,

637
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
and it was about the Golden Ratio,

638
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,320
about the aspect ratio that is used in art and architecture and design,

639
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,320
and I was pretty sure that credit cards were based on the Golden Ratio,

640
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
but apparently, according to Franco, they're not.

641
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,320
It's default by 86 centimeters,

642
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,320
and the ratio is 1.5925 and on and on,

643
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,320
and the Golden Ratio is 1.6180.

644
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,320
They do, maybe it's because I got one of those American Express black cards.

645
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,320
They have a different ratio.

646
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,320
An infinite sequence of numbers.

647
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
It's an irrational number, you know.

648
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,320
And it's been considered a very, very strange number,

649
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
a Marvelous number,

650
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,320
because it occurs many, many times in mathematics, in nature,

651
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:00,320
and it's been used in art, in paintings, in architecture too.

652
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,320
If you want the easiest way to get to the Golden Ratio,

653
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,320
you've got to take two measures,

654
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,320
if the ratio between the smallest and the largest,

655
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,320
is the same between the largest and the sum of the two,

656
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,320
you've got two dimensions in golden ratio.

657
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
This looks easy,

658
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,320
then you can take the sequence of Fibonacci,

659
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,320
Italian mathematician,

660
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,320
Fibonacci, a lot of time thinking about numbers.

661
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,320
I'll definitely put in a link to Fibonacci,

662
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,320
run semi-link after hearing about the Golden Ratio on an earlier show.

663
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
It's fascinating stuff.

664
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,320
You've got to kind of get through all the scary formulas,

665
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,320
but when you're there, it's fascinating.

666
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,320
He made the Fibonacci sequencing,

667
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,320
which every number is the sum of the previous two,

668
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,320
so you start with zero and one,

669
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,320
and then you have one and two and three and five and eight,

670
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,320
13, 21, 34, 55 and on and on.

671
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
Each number, the sum of the previous two.

672
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,320
Well, if you take any number of these sequence

673
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,320
and divide it by the previous one,

674
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,320
you've got always the same number.

675
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,320
That's the golden ratio again.

676
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,320
And you've got this in nature too,

677
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,320
you take the nautilus,

678
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,320
which is a creature of the sea,

679
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,320
it's some kind of spiral shell.

680
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,320
You take each arm of the spiral shell,

681
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,320
you divide the width of each spiral arm,

682
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,320
with the previous arm,

683
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,320
you've got the golden ratio.

684
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
So it occurs a lot of time,

685
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,320
and it's used a lot in symbology too,

686
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,320
from the mesons with the pentagon,

687
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,320
and you can find a lot of strange, incredible information

688
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
about this on any encyclopedia.

689
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,320
You can find it on Wikipedia too,

690
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,320
but you know you are a little allergic to Wikipedia,

691
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,320
so yeah.

692
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,320
Okay, I hope this is useful to sum of our listeners,

693
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,320
and wish you a great weekend.

694
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,320
Bye Adam.

695
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
My listeners from Italy.

696
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,320
Ciao, Ciao.

697
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,320
Pronto.

698
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,320
Franco.

699
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,320
Thank you very much.

700
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
You know Patricia keeps bugging me man.

701
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
She says, dude, when we take it a little bit easier

702
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
in a couple of years,

703
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,320
like that's gonna happen.

704
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,320
So I'd love a little apartment in Italy.

705
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,320
Well, I'm gonna have to get my man Franco on the case, baby.

706
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,320
Hey, this is Russell from the Raising Giants Podcast.

707
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,320
I just got done with a purchase of hosting at godaddy.com,

708
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:28,320
and with my purchase, I received a $1.99 and domain name.

709
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,320
And so, for the next year,

710
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,320
you are the recipient of all traffic heading to

711
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,320
curiecastle.com.

712
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,320
That's right, curiecastle.com was available,

713
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,320
and is now pointing at curie.com.

714
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,320
So hey, thanks for the great show Adam,

715
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,320
and talk to you soon.

716
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,320
Dude, thank you.

717
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,320
What I'll do is I'll set up a page.

718
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,320
That has one of those slurles to the,

719
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,320
so you can open up the castle directly in second life.

720
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,320
How's that sound?

721
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,320
One other thing that there's pretty cool,

722
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,320
although I'm waiting for the most recent entry,

723
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
so I can't plan for you today.

724
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,320
And there's a reason for that, too,

725
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,320
because we've got a team of pod show,

726
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,320
San Francisco's in London this week.

727
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,320
Is the EarthLink Ad Challenge,

728
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,320
where, you know, this is the, this is what you hear at the beginning of the podcast.

729
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,320
You think advertising sucks?

730
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,320
Well, we, and that's pod show,

731
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,320
and EarthLink are putting our money,

732
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,320
where our, well, your mouth is,

733
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,320
and we want you to make an endorsement,

734
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,320
or a commercial, or a jingle.

735
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,320
What does it just be creative?

736
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,320
It doesn't really matter.

737
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,320
It's whatever you think will be an interesting way

738
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,320
to advertise EarthLink services.

739
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,320
Go to Ad Challenge ADCH-A-N-G,

740
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,320
something or other.

741
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,320
Double L in there.

742
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,320
I'll put a link in the show notes.

743
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,320
AdChallenge.podshow.com for all the details.

744
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,320
And if, and if you're one of the winners,

745
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,320
then you will actually make real money

746
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,320
by this commercial going into rotation.

747
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,320
So it's an opportunity, all part of our,

748
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,320
quit your day job scheme,

749
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,320
and quite a scheme it is indeed.

750
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
Hey Adam, this is Stuart Story, a key Stuart Wolf

751
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
in second life.

752
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,320
Just have a couple of comments to say to you.

753
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,320
First one's about the fantastic piece of podcasting software,

754
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,320
called Cast Velastra.

755
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,320
Or to know about Cast Velastra is,

756
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,320
will there be a Cast Velastra light version?

757
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,320
If it is, then I'll gladly test it out for you

758
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,320
before it goes public.

759
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,320
Just engage in it,

760
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,320
and you know what I mean by Cast Velastra light.

761
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,320
I mean like a rundown version of it,

762
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,320
where, right now,

763
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,320
can basically use it for free.

764
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,320
And you don't have to pay for it

765
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,320
like the actual Cast Velastra.

766
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,320
Yeah, but Stuart, dude.

767
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,320
If you download Cast Velastra from Cast Velastra.com,

768
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
it does exactly that.

769
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,320
And you can use full function for as long as you like,

770
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,320
only it's time limited,

771
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,320
so you can't create an hour's long podcast,

772
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,320
but go ahead, man, you can test it out

773
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,320
and make as many podcasts you like.

774
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,320
So please, be my guest.

775
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,320
I don't know if you actually check it out or not,

776
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
but it's fully functional.

777
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
This would help me a bunch,

778
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,320
because I actually do a podcast,

779
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,320
but I am plugged it on your podcast,

780
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
but we'll do it at the end of this comment.

781
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
It will help a lot,

782
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,320
because we're trying to make the podcast absolutely free for me.

783
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,320
So it's not making any donation,

784
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,320
so we'll ask for a donation of the book.

785
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,320
Okay, alright.

786
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,320
So Stuart, go check it out at CastVastra.com.

787
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,320
And hopefully this afternoon,

788
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,320
I'm going to have a session with CastVastra Mike.

789
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,320
We're going to sit down and do a Skype call and catch up.

790
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,320
I wish I had more time to talk to developers more regularly.

791
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,320
We've got a lot of developers that I love talking to,

792
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,320
and it's a very creative process,

793
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,320
but mainly due to time zone issues and stuff like that,

794
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,320
and just when I'm over here, it's busy too.

795
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,320
And with Mike, I like to spend a couple hours of possible,

796
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,320
and we really should sit together as what we should do.

797
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,320
Because he's got all kinds of features in there.

798
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:08,320
All kinds of enhanced audio plus,

799
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
so you can bake in pictures.

800
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,320
Now, granted, that's only working in his receiver

801
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,320
at the time being called Wind Potter.

802
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,320
But the format is very easy,

803
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,320
and it will work with any MP3 as far as I understand.

804
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,320
So once we're over a couple of humps with our own player,

805
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,320
the dashboard, then we're definitely going to implement that.

806
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,320
And I haven't actually had an opportunity to get into it

807
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
to figure out exactly how it works,

808
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,320
but it's a typical CastVastra style doing stuff on the fly.

809
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,320
So I'll keep you up to speed on that.

810
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,320
Now, it's going to be a weird week.

811
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,320
Wednesday, there may not be a show,

812
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,320
because we've got our team in London this week.

813
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,320
As you know, we have a great partnership with British telecom,

814
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,320
and then we're talking about launching stuff really quickly.

815
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,320
So you're going to see Pod Show Plus,

816
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,320
the PDN launching in the United States,

817
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,320
and of course for the rest of the world,

818
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,320
but also specifically a version in the UK,

819
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,320
which will be, you know, we're building a UK directory.

820
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,320
There's no kind of all kinds of stuff that we're doing,

821
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,320
and we're meeting with,

822
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,320
we actually, we now have, I guess we call it a general manager

823
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,320
for Pod Show in UK,

824
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,320
fellow named Dan Winner.

825
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,320
And so I've met him a couple of times over the past few months,

826
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,320
and so it's just, it's going so incredibly fast.

827
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,320
And I know nothing, nothing about setting up business in the UK.

828
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,320
Other than that, I have to get different paperwork,

829
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,320
but that'll be a part of my mission on the next San Francisco trip.

830
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,320
So tomorrow night we're having dinner,

831
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,320
and then, you know, we have meetings,

832
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,320
Wednesday morning, meetings with advertising agencies,

833
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,320
and production people, people for the offices.

834
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,320
It's just, it's nuts.

835
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,320
And what's cool about it is, you know,

836
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,320
this is happening with real revenues.

837
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,320
You know, this is not a,

838
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,320
oh, let's take some investment money and go open up an office

839
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320
in every European country.

840
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,320
No, this is, you know, like East Coast style that we're doing.

841
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,320
It's like, okay, you know, it makes business sense now.

842
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,320
And we see the revenues, we're going to open up an office.

843
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,320
So it'll be a pretty low key and pretty cheap for a while,

844
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,320
but I'm very excited about it.

845
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,320
So looking forward to that Friday,

846
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,320
I'm also going to go into the office.

847
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,320
So there's a chance that Wednesday will either be,

848
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
will not exist at all as a show,

849
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
or it may be very late.

850
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,320
So I'll keep you up the speed,

851
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,320
and just keep you up the speed and what's going on,

852
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,320
because this is darn cool.

853
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,320
Come extra.

854
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,320
Come extra.

855
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,320
Come extra.

856
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,320
Come extra.

857
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,320
Come extra.

858
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,320
Come extra.

859
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,320
Come extra.

860
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,320
Come extra.

861
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,320
Come extra.

862
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,320
Come extra.

863
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,320
Come extra.

864
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,320
Come extra.

865
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,320
Hiya, Adam Kerry.

866
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,320
Hiya.

867
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,320
And yes, fuck your blackberry very much because we're in the most mobile can push

868
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,320
he made, but it's almost as hot as Angelina Jolie.

869
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,320
No, no, no, no, no.

870
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,320
Windows Mobile is not as hot as Angelina Jolie.

871
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,320
And let me just say, come extra blogger.

872
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,320
Yeah, it's fine.

873
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,320
Windows is fine.

874
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,320
But usually these Windows things suck as telephones,

875
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,320
or they're too big, and the blackberry really has it.

876
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,320
Combined with Geneva and Eastern.

877
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,320
Anyway, do you know maybe such game called cheeky beggars?

878
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,320
Let's play it.

879
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,320
Adam.

880
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,320
Adam.

881
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,320
Do you agree with Daddy?

882
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,320
And give me a counted pdf.

883
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,320
Please, it should go on top.

884
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,320
You invented podcasting.

885
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,320
You place the sun in the right position.

886
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,320
You are moving for the fear single-handedly in the right direction.

887
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,320
Without you, Adam Kerry.

888
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:39,320
Most podcasts would still be feeding pigs in bundoks.

889
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,320
There's the one you should get another prize.

890
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,320
I am sure that Queen of England should name you.

891
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,320
Sir, Adam Kerry.

892
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,320
Of course.

893
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,320
So be good Daddy.

894
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,320
Like go Daddy.com.

895
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,320
And give me please now account at pdf.

896
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,320
Please, please please please.

897
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,320
Yo.

898
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,320
Yo.

899
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,320
And you're so transparent blogger.

900
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,320
Dude, you know, I don't know.

901
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,320
You want to, we can't surface the pages yet.

902
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,320
We're only talking, it's just moments away.

903
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,320
Okay?

904
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,320
I'll make sure that you're the first one in.

905
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,320
But I don't know, man, to have you as a beta test,

906
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,320
so that seems like a lot of work.

907
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,320
You know what I'm saying?

908
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,320
It could swamp the entire development team.

909
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,320
You know, since, you know,

910
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,320
well, not just since, since thinking about pod show UK,

911
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,320
but even since moving to the UK,

912
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,320
I've, you know, really been trying to listen to as many UK podcasts as possible.

913
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,320
Mainly just to, you know, to soak up culture, if you will.

914
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,320
And, uh, want to congratulate Richard Vobes.

915
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,320
I think today is his 500th show.

916
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,320
He's got me beat.

917
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,320
And he does, I think he does one a seven days a week or something like that.

918
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,320
And, uh, it's, uh, you should check it out.

919
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,320
Richard Vobes.com.

920
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,320
Richard Vobes.com.

921
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,320
I'll put a link in the show notes.

922
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,320
Uh, I'm subscribed and therefore don't look at the URL anymore.

923
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,320
Um, but, uh, congratulations Richard.

924
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:10,320
Extremely cool to see, uh, you go in so strongly here in the UK.

925
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,320
And looking forward to maybe hooking up something with pod show.

926
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,320
Hey Adam, Paul Durham from Black Lab again.

927
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,320
You want to test them on you a little about whether or not pod casting works.

928
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,320
How's this?

929
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,320
Let the pod us fear and February with our single see the sun.

930
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,320
Although we did notice immediate spikes in web traffic, pod play and fan mail.

931
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,320
We had no way to gauge the dollars and sense of it all.

932
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:37,320
But now the numbers are in sales are up 60% on iTunes, 50% on Amazon with no other explanation

933
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,320
other than you guys and the amazing world you're making.

934
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,320
We used to be on Geffen Records.

935
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,320
But, you know, we spend more time talking to lawyers and suits than making music.

936
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,320
Now we're independent.

937
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:52,320
Spend our time talking to fans, making more money and rocking the daily source code.

938
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,320
Thanks Adam.

939
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,320
Do you?

940
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,320
Dude.

941
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,320
You can't just I can't tell you what that means to hear that.

942
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,320
That is so incredibly cool.

943
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,320
So this is the premiere of their new song, Black Labs.

944
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,320
Ecstasy.

945
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,320
Soon for sale on the pod safe music network.

946
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,320
Let your body you flow.

947
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:27,320
I do your instinct good and deep as the world just goes down.

948
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:33,320
Throw my clothes out in the street and be on the wall.

949
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,320
Yeah.

950
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:16,320
Don't lose I don't know.

951
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,320
Now your sister's on the gun.

952
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,320
One by one.

953
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,320
One, two, three, six.

954
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,320
One is on the gun.

955
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,320
And the sound is the one and the more so.

956
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,320
The feature on your gun.

957
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,320
I guess I should feel like it just stay.

958
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,320
But forgets love and you know what that means.

959
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,320
Yeah.

960
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,320
And someone wants you to sing.

961
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,320
Everybody's lonely.

962
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,320
Don't say anybody's happy.

963
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,320
Or isn't just the alcohol.

964
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,320
I don't know.

965
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,320
I don't know.

966
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,320
I don't know.

967
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,320
I don't know.

968
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:17,320
I don't know.

969
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:39,320
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love.

970
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:44,320
If you feel like starting.

971
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:56,320
I love, love, love, love, love, love.

972
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,320
I don't know.

973
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,320
Because everyone's ecstasy.

974
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,320
Underneath it all.

975
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:08,320
And everybody's lonely.

976
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,320
I don't know what that means.

977
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,320
But everybody's happy.

978
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,320
Or isn't just the alcohol.

979
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,320
I don't know.

980
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,320
I don't know.

981
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,320
I don't know.

982
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,320
I don't know.

983
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,320
I don't know.

984
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,320
Wow.

985
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,320
I like it.

986
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,320
Kind of shades of ultra-vox in there.

987
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,320
I like it.

988
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,320
I like it.

989
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,320
I like it.

990
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,320
I like it.

991
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,320
I like it.

992
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,320
I like it.

993
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,320
I like it.

994
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,320
I like it.

995
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,320
I like it.

996
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,320
I like it.

997
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,320
I like it.

998
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,320
I like it.

999
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,320
I like it.

1000
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,320
I like it.

1001
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,320
I like it.

1002
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,320
I like it.

1003
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,320
I like it.

1004
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,320
I like it.

1005
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,320
I like it.

1006
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,320
I like it.

1007
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,320
I like it.

1008
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,320
I like it.

1009
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,320
I like it.

1010
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,320
I like it.

1011
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,320
I like it.

1012
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,320
I like it.

1013
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,320
I like it.

1014
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,320
I like it.

1015
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,320
I like it.

1016
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,320
I like it.

1017
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,320
Yeah, and Windows.

1018
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,320
Take care of everybody.

1019
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,320
See you tomorrow.

1020
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,320
Another pot-show pot-cast.

1021
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:19,320
Stick it in your ear.

1022
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,320
Yeah, this pot-cast.

1023
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,720
And we're great ones like it on the High Performance Pot-cast delivery network from

1024
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,720
Podshow and Line White networks.

1025
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,720
I love it.
