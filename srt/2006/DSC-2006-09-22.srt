7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Go's front will intimidate the Swedish version right now.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Close your eyes and imagine who you hear.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Do this night to let the audience shine cool down,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
off stick to the 166.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That's right, Swedish girls say first to the 166.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Imagine the DSC, 466.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's fun to hear the curry's both having some kicks with Adam and the Lady Patricia in the mix.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So happy together.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
One kill!

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
One kill!

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
One kill!

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
One kill!

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
One kill!

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
One kill!

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
One kill!

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
One kill!

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,000
One kill!

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
One kill!

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes, Adam and Patricia, Adam and the Lady Patricia.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I got blue right away.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That's all you got to say.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm thinking about thinking about some things I thought I'd never be thinking.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Too many drugs dropped into my mouth.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Looking for something new, but I end up drinking.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He'd know the warnings on the show.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll take my chance and be into danger.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I want to taste life more and more, but you need a little risk full of this picture.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
This is just action under the control.

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Hard casting for you to let go.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This is just action under the control.

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Can I feel it?

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Can I feel it?

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Can I feel it?

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Can I feel it?

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I got blue right away.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's all I got to say.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
She's just a flame and a bomb.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Now, how do you explore unstable?

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
A big suit with a briefcase.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm holding contracts state and higher label.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
All in all, do a phone on hold on.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Do a way for the next operator.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I want to taste life uncontrolled.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh no, give a go.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I hope to see you later.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This is just action under the control.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Hard casting for you to let go.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This is just action under the control.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Can I feel it?

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Can I feel it?

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Can I feel it?

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Can I feel it?

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Can I feel it?

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Can I feel it?

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Can I feel it?

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Can I feel it?

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Can I feel it?

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Can I feel it?

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Can I feel it?

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I can feel it?

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Can I feel it?

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I've casted for you to play soul

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This is a station of the nature

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You have given up your love you're not in good show

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
This is a station of the mode control

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Like a sporadized hero

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This is a station of the mode control

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You have given up your love you're not in good show

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
All the rest in there are the lies

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
All the cast in the same world

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's the seed

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Everything that has the lies

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
All the cast in the same world

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
All the cast in the same world

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
All the cast in the same world

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
No control

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Gee, I wonder why they call themselves pepper

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Do you think it sounds a little bit like the Red Hot Chili peppers?

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Just a little bit

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Just a little bit

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That was good though

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You can find out the podcast music network

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And of course in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Doesn't get any more real than this

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I was normally I would ask you what you thought of the song

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And you would have listened to the whole thing

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But you were on the phone

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Exactly

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The moment the song stopped

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The minute the song kicked in

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And I was like, what the hell do I?

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Why is the whole playing in the background on this song?

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Because my generation is your room town

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You wouldn't reach me

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I don't know

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Bruce, what we didn't hear

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Because we were listening to all the opening sequence

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That's it

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That was Bruce, the realtor

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yes, it was Bruce the realtor

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Everyone already knows we're looking at 10,000 homes

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
How many times?

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
At the same time

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And there was another house

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But the lady is not moving

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Quick enough

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Quick enough for us

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Speak into the microphone

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So let's look further

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Because she never know what you find

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That's what we said

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Correct and we know

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We know now that you don't have to be decent

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And just wait

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Just do anything you want to do

123
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What does that mean?

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Well that means that we were always very polite

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Because that's the way we thought

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's how we've been raised in my dear

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Exactly

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We are polite

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
In other countries

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You'd just say yes

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And that's it

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You've got a house

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You've got a house right

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And you say yes

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And you

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Don't me shit

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Doesn't mean you

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So now we got it

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We finally got it

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We got it

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But no that's what I mean

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
We understand

144
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We know the game now

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah we got it

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So we just go on

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We say to people

148
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Okay

149
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
If you don't want our offer

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We're move on

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yeah

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And then they get scared

153
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So

156
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So yes

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This is for the Curry Colosseum

158
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Uh-huh

159
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
They said yes

160
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Really?

161
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes

162
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And how soon can they get the fuck out?

163
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He wants to talk about that

164
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Because she's ready to move

166
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Because she already has her

167
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Old people

168
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Apartments somewhere

169
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Wow

170
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's exciting

171
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And it's only one street away from where we are now

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
No

173
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This is an exciting move

174
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So far away

175
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Wow

176
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's great

177
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah

178
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Now we just have to figure out how to legally do it

179
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
People fucking hate me here

180
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I have no cloud

181
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Adam who

182
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
No

183
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's

184
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And then you know the Americans with their beautiful stories

185
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And you know

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Sometimes you know

187
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Because I always like

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Smooth

189
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Talker

190
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes exactly

191
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That's what I always do

192
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And then I look at them and they laugh

193
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And I can see they're generally

194
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
They generally are humored

195
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Exactly

196
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But there's something behind there

197
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That maybe says

198
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You fucking yank

199
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yank

200
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't you think there's something just hiding

201
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm not falling for it

202
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah

203
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You fucked us 250 years ago man

204
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You don't want to trust you

205
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We still don't trust you

206
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But you guys save everybody in the war

207
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So you know

208
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We've got of course

209
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We love you

210
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Why

211
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We love the Americans

212
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah

213
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
World War Two

214
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Was definitely

215
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
They saved us

216
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
They came with the Jew and government

217
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Chocolate and

218
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Haptus

219
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Your mom remembers that right

220
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah

221
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah

222
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
When the liberators drove through

223
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Her parents had a hotel

224
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh, I bet she had to

225
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
A good time with the GIs

226
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
No, they're all third

227
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Uh huh

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
She was a decent girl

229
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Please

230
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And she always said no

231
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
No

232
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Oh please

233
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And she really regrets it now

234
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
When those Americans

235
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
When they came through after

236
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
After kicking everybody's ass

237
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
When they came in

238
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
They were getting laid

239
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Left and right

240
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yeah, with her

241
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Chocolate and

242
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Gums and great bodies

243
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The circumcised teenises

244
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah

245
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh my gosh

246
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
This isn't you

247
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I just actually read in the paper

248
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That

249
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
They know now that

250
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It doesn't matter if you have sex

251
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Or not

252
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
If you feel you don't want to have sex

253
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Did you know that

254
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Doesn't matter for what

255
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's healthy

256
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Well, they thought that it's

257
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Very unhealthy

258
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
When you don't have sex

259
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You know like when you say to people

260
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Who have no

261
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Relationship

262
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Oh, that's very unhealthy

263
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You should find a boyfriend

264
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's not good for your body

265
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Well, you have to have sex

266
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
No

267
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Of course you do

268
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
If you don't have sex

269
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And you're doing

270
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You're occupying your mind

271
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
With something else

272
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And you're very busy

273
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And you actually don't think about it

274
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yeah

275
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's okay

276
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah, but you have to have sex

277
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Once in a while

278
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Nothing

279
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Because we were talking about

280
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Sex

281
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And I was just reading that

282
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And I thought it was interesting

283
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Because sometimes

284
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You're not thinking about it

285
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You're doing other stuff

286
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So kidding

287
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You know and I say it doesn't matter

288
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
If the body doesn't ask for it

289
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's okay

290
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
If the body doesn't ask for it

291
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's okay

292
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I think my body is asking for it

293
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Right now

294
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
My body is saying

295
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh, it's asking

296
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Do you hear it?

297
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Just talking about it

298
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
For men

299
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
He's already like quick

300
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Pointing

301
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Pointing

302
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Pointing

303
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Sometimes

304
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's it

305
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That's it

306
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Hey, dude

307
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So we have a house

308
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
We have a house

309
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh man

310
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
My dog

311
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Now we're stuck

312
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Now we're stuck

313
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's a curry colisean

314
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Is that we're going to call it?

315
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Uh

316
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah, it's sort of an empire

317
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Roman

318
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Kind of a Roman look

319
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And I have to say

320
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
This time

321
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Although we are in England

322
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We thought we got them

323
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
By the most English kind of

324
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
In looking house that we can find

325
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Turns out

326
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
A lot of the English houses are

327
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Fugly

328
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So shitty

329
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yeah, especially inside

330
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah

331
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You know

332
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Like Dutch people for example

333
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Think it's very important to do stuff

334
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
To your house and make it beautiful

335
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Because it's your home

336
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's your past

337
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Americans do that well

338
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Very proud of it

339
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah

340
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Very proud of it

341
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And here

342
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's just a place

343
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yeah, we already talked about it, I guess

344
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yeah

345
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
People like to do other stuff

346
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You know

347
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
For as long as everything

348
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You're working in house

349
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yeah

350
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's okay

351
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And they're sitting

352
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
In houses

353
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
There's still 70s

354
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But I think it's also

355
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's just so expensive to buy a house

356
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Very

357
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Because you have to pay tax

358
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's a varying scale

359
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
If you buy a house over 500,000 pounds

360
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's 4% tax

361
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And I think

362
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Between

363
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
4 and 5 is 3%

364
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And it goes down to 1%

365
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But you still have to pay a percentage

366
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
In just tax

367
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And there's no

368
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
No, there's no

369
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The ductible

370
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
No interest deduction

371
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
From your income taxes

372
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yes

373
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So I think they're happy to get a house

374
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And then they probably all have good intentions

375
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Oh, I'm going to fix this up

376
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'll change this

377
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
We'll do this

378
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We have a little bit of money

379
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
We'll do that

380
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And then never happens, of course

381
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Because it never does

382
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's a lot of money

383
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And we have to do some stuff here too

384
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Before we move in

385
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
If it all passes

386
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And we just moved here

387
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And we're not here for such a long time

388
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We had to do a lot of adjustment

389
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And that's not being

390
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
That doesn't go over very well

391
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That we have only temporary residency

392
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And not permanent residency

393
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah, yeah

394
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
For you

395
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah, absolutely

396
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Absolutely

397
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Absolutely

398
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm accepted

399
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Everywhere

400
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes, you already

401
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The lady price

402
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And the lady

403
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yes, that helps

404
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But anyway

405
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
This house looks very American

406
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It certainly does

407
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Very American

408
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yeah, but it's nice though

409
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Isn't it?

410
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I think it looks beautiful

411
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah

412
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We're going to make it even cooler

413
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah, because in London

414
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You see a lot of that empire style

415
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You know, with the little pillars

416
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And this is not too big

417
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Because you know, there's a lot of work

418
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
If you have a big house

419
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I know that now

420
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Who wants a big house

421
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Just have a house

422
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That everybody has his

423
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You know, his big house

424
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's also very easy to buy

425
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
There's a lot of them you can buy

426
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah

427
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But it's very interesting

428
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
When it comes to selling

429
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah

430
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's a lot harder

431
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's a lot harder

432
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's a lot harder

433
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's a lot harder

434
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's a lot harder

435
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's a lot harder

436
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's a lot harder

437
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's a lot harder

438
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's a lot harder

439
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's a lot harder

440
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's a lot harder

441
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's a lot harder

442
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's a lot harder

443
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's a lot harder

444
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's a lot harder

445
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's a lot harder

446
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's a lot harder

447
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's a lot harder

448
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's a lot harder

449
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's a lot harder

450
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's a lot harder

451
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's a lot harder

452
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's a lot harder

453
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's a lot harder

454
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's a lot harder

455
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I already explained the chamber

456
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
He didn't get it

457
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
This is sort of radio show

458
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Sort of

459
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, I'm so terribly sorry

460
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's very...

461
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Do you want to sauce it?

462
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I thought it

463
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah

464
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You expect to ask you that

465
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Any minute now

466
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
But would you like to have a sauce it?

467
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Last night

468
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It was kind of scary last night

469
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
All of a sudden Patricia is upright in bed

470
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And she says

471
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The lady Patricia says my chest hurts

472
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Well, there was an elephant standing on her chest

473
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Suddenly in the middle of my sleep

474
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And I know what I was dreaming of

475
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't think it was something exciting

476
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Or everything

477
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I think all this stuff is giving you stress

478
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Even though it doesn't feel like stress

479
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Just not knowing stuff

480
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I have this

481
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I know I have the feeling in my stomach

482
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's like, am I excited?

483
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
No, yes

484
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yes, yes

485
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yes, yes

486
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Exactly

487
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You don't want to be excited

488
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You're almost in the phone rings

489
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm like looking at the phone numbers

490
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Like this is the agent

491
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Is this, yes

492
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Somebody wants money

493
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's not

494
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Crikey, it's a bill collector

495
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah, maybe that's it

496
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Because in my head

497
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I just...

498
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
This is funny

499
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I have had those times

500
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I know

501
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I know that

502
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But

503
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yeah, that could be

504
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
In my head

505
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm having fun with it

506
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But it's also very irritating

507
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So do you think that that's what the chess pain was

508
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Because it was quite concerning

509
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And I tried to stay asleep

510
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
To make sure you weren't dying on me

511
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
In fact

512
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You tried to stay asleep

513
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
A wake-a-me

514
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Oh

515
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Right now, obviously

516
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But then I actually woke up

517
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Like an hour later

518
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And then I was

519
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And you were really, really still

520
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And I was like, oh man

521
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yeah

522
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And I was like, what?

523
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Touch my nose and you were warm

524
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What to do with it either

525
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Because when I go to the doctor

526
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But you just went to the doctor for this

527
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yes

528
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And he said it was the house stream

529
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No

530
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
She

531
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And she said

532
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I was probably stressed by it

533
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Without knowing it

534
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Now you know I am a inside stressor

535
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yes

536
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You wouldn't see anything on the outside

537
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Because I'm so used to being in control

538
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Because everybody's watching

539
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Control

540
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah

541
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Everybody's watching

542
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
People are watching on TV

543
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And I'm in control

544
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's not true

545
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But it's not true

546
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
No, of course not

547
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But that's the entertainer lifestyle

548
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That's why

549
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I think so

550
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
While entertainer is dying

551
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Almost dying

552
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah

553
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And you're so nervous

554
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But nobody will notice

555
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So maybe I was stressing

556
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And I don't know

557
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't know

558
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And

559
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's still hurt today

560
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It hurts a little bit

561
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Like somebody was running over me a little bit

562
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yeah

563
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Very strange

564
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But

565
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Don't talk about it

566
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I don't talk about it

567
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I don't talk about it

568
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I don't want it

569
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
No, I understand

570
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And when I wake up

571
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And from this

572
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I was like, oh, leave me alone

573
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Don't do this

574
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I don't want this

575
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You sure you don't want to have that checked?

576
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Well, it's going to be time anyway

577
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
In a couple of weeks

578
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And then I have to come and go to the

579
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You sure you don't want it

580
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You don't want to go earlier

581
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
No

582
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Maybe maybe no

583
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
We have to check

584
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Maybe no

585
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
No

586
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Okay

587
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
We have a house

588
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
We'll have a house

589
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
We'll have a house

590
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
We'll just find out

591
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
How long it'll take to get the house

592
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I think we could move pretty fast

593
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah, but

594
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's not the house that we want

595
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You know, on the inside

596
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
We have to do some

597
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
No, but we can start the work pretty quickly

598
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And it's only inside work

599
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Mainly so it wouldn't involve outside work

600
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So that could be done even in the winter

601
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah

602
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So

603
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Could be okay

604
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yeah

605
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Don't you worry, baby

606
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I got it all in the control

607
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'll take care of it

608
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I saved a couple of voice mail messages

609
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
This one

610
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's a real bummer message

611
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But I figured if anyone could help

612
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It would be the lady Patricia

613
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Adam

614
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Well, it's someone from the world

615
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Calling your show

616
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And I have a real mind

617
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Fuck up in my head at a moment

618
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I was wondering if you plan my comment on your show

619
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And then

620
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So what do you stick about is time to meet?

621
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That's what

622
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Anyway

623
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Here's my problem

624
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I had a sister-in-law

625
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And my sister-in-law is involved

626
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You know, very very heavy

627
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Relationship

628
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It looks like violence

629
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Lots of alcohol

630
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And a lot of

631
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Over and forth

632
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Driving each other with

633
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I don't know what

634
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Issue is just one step up

635
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But

636
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Whatever she goes back to get her stuff

637
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Something's happening

638
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And she's going back to it

639
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I don't get it at all

640
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm totally frustrated about this

641
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm totally frustrated about this

642
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Nothing I can do or say to make this change

643
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I was wondering if there are people on your show

644
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That have similar things

645
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Or experience similar things

646
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I don't know why

647
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I don't know why she goes back to get her stuff

648
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Every time she goes back to get her stuff

649
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Something's happening

650
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Or experience similar situation

651
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I wonder

652
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Why do I know the people go back

653
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
One of my thoughts

654
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Is that could be

655
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And that's why it's actually my big questions

656
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You could be that you get addicted to the bashing

657
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That you go back for

658
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Why don't go for more movies

659
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Stupid

660
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That you go back to someone

661
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Because you're addicted to the violence

662
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't get it

663
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Maybe someone in your show

664
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And you can answer that

665
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Well for me

666
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Well of course

667
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
There's always someone here who can answer your question

668
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Because no matter what your question is

669
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
When it comes to love relationships

670
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And everything of human interaction

671
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The lady Patricia has advice for you

672
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Well I think

673
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I think that

674
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
She wants this relationship to work

675
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Probably

676
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But it doesn't

677
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Right

678
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And she wants it actually to work so bad

679
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
But it doesn't

680
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Right

681
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So every time she goes back

682
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
He probably says

683
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You know I'm going to do

684
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm going to be better

685
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I promise baby

686
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I promise baby

687
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Look at my eyes

688
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Look at my eyes

689
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Look at my eyes

690
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Look at my eyes

691
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I will do better

692
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And I'm not going to do that

693
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm such an idiot

694
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm such an

695
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
An asshole

696
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You know they say

697
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Everything to make themselves

698
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yes I know

699
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I am this

700
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And I'm not going to do it anymore

701
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And you want to believe it

702
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You want to believe it

703
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Because actually there's something in that person

704
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
That you really love

705
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Only that other part

706
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You get with it

707
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Well I think the alcohol won't help

708
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That's definitely

709
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And of course the alcohol

710
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
They drink both right

711
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Sounds like

712
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah

713
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That of course too

714
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That has to stop

715
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Because otherwise

716
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Because you're not yourself

717
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You know with alcohol

718
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Everybody knows that

719
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You're saying things

720
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And you do things that you usually don't do

721
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah

722
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
So that's not good

723
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But so I think there's a part

724
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So what she loves

725
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
She loves him

726
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So what can can you do anything to

727
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Break this cycle

728
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
No I think she has to do it

729
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
She just has to live for a while

730
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And say you have to stop drinking

731
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I don't know what she's drinking

732
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I don't know what she's drinking

733
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Well he has to stop drinking

734
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And prove that he can do it without alcohol

735
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And then sometimes

736
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You have dinner maybe to get

737
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And see if it works out

738
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But you know

739
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And then start slowly all over again

740
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
But dude

741
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I think this is wrong

742
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I think that's so wrong

743
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
She cannot go back to it

744
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And if she did not work

745
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And if they stopped seeing each other

746
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
For now

747
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Maybe she gets over him

748
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But they need to separate for a while

749
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I think it won't work

750
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I think she needs to make a break

751
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So the brother-in-law is right

752
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And what is the brother-in-law

753
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So that means it's exactly

754
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Exactly

755
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It means it's his brother

756
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
If it's his sister-in-law

757
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Oh yeah

758
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Then it's his brother

759
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Who is the abusive one

760
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So maybe he should have a talk with his brother

761
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Okay

762
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And say you know bro

763
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Lay off the booze or something like that

764
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yeah it's his sister-in-law

765
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yeah right

766
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But anyway

767
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah they have to separate for a while

768
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Or anything

769
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But they have to just

770
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Stop seeing each other for a while

771
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That's my idea

772
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And maybe we'll never work

773
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I don't know how long they know each other

774
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It won't work

775
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
She needs to stop

776
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Don't go back

777
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Yeah

778
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yeah

779
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
This is bad

780
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You know that I like that

781
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Once I say

782
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I know that's why I'm disagreeing with your advice

783
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I mean you're exactly like

784
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Well you know

785
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But that was younger

786
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I don't know how old she is

787
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I thought differently

788
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You know you still believe that

789
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
But when I got older

790
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I thought

791
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm not going to waste my time

792
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Exactly

793
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That's the pictures I wanted to tell you

794
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I don't want to waste my time

795
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's life is beautiful

796
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
There's so many nice men

797
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So many nice people

798
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You know go and have a look somewhere else

799
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Markio Shimoda Nemcoff

800
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
From Pacifico's Hellway

801
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Potio L.A.

802
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Just Shadow Falls as well

803
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yeah

804
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
He did a thing yesterday

805
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Like his guaranteed method

806
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Do you hear the rain outside?

807
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah

808
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Listen to it

809
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's rain

810
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's like a cloud break

811
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yeah

812
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
There's so many women that say

813
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You know I can't I can't find a guy

814
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And he said the sure the sure way

815
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
To absolutely get a guy

816
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Is to lower your expectations

817
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Yeah

818
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And I think you know really

819
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Well that isn't it

820
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
What we always said to my sister

821
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm glad you brought her up

822
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I wasn't going to

823
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
She's still things that

824
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
She's listening to this show

825
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Yeah sort of James Bond

826
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Will stop in front of a door

827
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Hey

828
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Open up

829
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And then he comes out of his beautiful

830
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Where?

831
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And says is he supposed to?

832
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Asked an asking Martin

833
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Or anything?

834
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I was looking for you

835
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You know

836
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah

837
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's not going to happen

838
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
The thing is any guy will do anything for sex

839
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It probably

840
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
No

841
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
They'll get married for sex

842
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Absolutely

843
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
You just have to lower your expectations

844
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
You know what?

845
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And some of these not so good looking guys

846
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
They're probably great lovers

847
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And really great guys

848
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Yeah

849
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Probably

850
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Yeah

851
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
True

852
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
They are looking me

853
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I mean I'm just smoking mirrors

854
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Yeah

855
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You know that?

856
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's always happened somewhere

857
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Where you don't expect it

858
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You know

859
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You never know

860
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It comes in

861
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Maybe just walking the store

862
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Now you've got to lower your expectations

863
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And you know what?

864
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
My sister doesn't even look anymore

865
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
She stopped

866
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
She said I'm happy

867
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm happy the way

868
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Really?

869
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Because we can look her up

870
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm sure that we can find some daily source code guys

871
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Just so much energy

872
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I don't know

873
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
She's working

874
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
She's very busy

875
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
She doesn't have a problem

876
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
She says she doesn't feel lonely

877
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So

878
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You know

879
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Alright

880
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
She's wonderful

881
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
For I think she would make a beautiful

882
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And wonderful

883
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Yeah, I agree

884
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I agree

885
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You know

886
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Okay

887
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I want to talk about Richard Hammond

888
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
In a minute

889
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
But first we got to play a song

890
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Okay

891
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Because there's Friday

892
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You know people sending shit in

893
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And they expect to play

894
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Okay

895
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Why is this?

896
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You're out there

897
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I'd like to make a motion

898
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
To rock this mother out

899
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
You're on her

900
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Please don't bang that gavel

901
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
You can try this cowbell out

902
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Let's all give a nod

903
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
To the hardest work in law here

904
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
He's charging time

905
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Yeah

906
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000

Oh yeah

You're on her

909
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
What do you say?

910
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
He might even live with this case

911
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
He's charging time

912
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Yeah

He's charging time

915
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Oh

916
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000

918
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
He's charging time

He's charging time

921
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yeah

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
What's up ACs?

923
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
He's charging time

924
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
The official musical

925
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Just of the Chacha

926
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Whoa

928
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Whoa

929
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
The stuff I sensed last week

930
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Didn't hit you

931
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Dude

932
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Dude, this ain't some marketing guy

933
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You're talking to this ain't

934
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Bend over bitch

935
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
No man, this is Jersey Todd

936
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But alright, I'll give it to you

937
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'll give you last week

938
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It was a little flat

939
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I got to send you something new

940
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I got to send you something fresh

941
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I got to reboot

942
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
The Jersey Todd portion of the Chacha

943
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And I got something for you

944
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You're not going to find it on the

945
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Potsay music network

946
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
But they're coming

947
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
We're working on it real hard

948
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I'm sending a billion emails

949
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
These people

950
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
They've given me an exclusive to play this song

951
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And they told me I can play it on any

952
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Other podcasts that I can find

953
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And I'm playing it today on the daily source code

954
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Yeah, this is something different than you've heard from Jersey Todd

955
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
This is the wild bunch

I wish we had a better recording.

986
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,400
That of course was an MP3,

987
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,400
Yeah.

988
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,400
Oh, I love that.

989
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,400

That was awesome.

993
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,400
I wish that we had a better recording.

994
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
That was of course, was an MP3.

995
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,400
Yeah.

996
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
I've been MP3.

997
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,400
I've been MP3.

998
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,400
I'm sure, but I bet that sounds awesome on speakers.

999
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
That was good, wasn't it?

1000
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
That was good.

1001
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Wild bunch.

1002
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,400
It was a good for you.

1003
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,400
It was fucking great, baby.

1004
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,400
Oh.

1005
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Get him on the podcast and music network.

1006
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
Cheers, Todd.

1007
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Yes.

1008
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,400
ASAP, dude.

1009
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
Definitely.

1010
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
Big, big, huge.

1011
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
I agree.

1012
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
I think that could be.

1013
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Shh.

1014
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
It's got everything.

1015
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,400
Big.

1016
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
It does, doesn't it?

1017
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,400
Oh, and you know, you're dancing right away.

1018
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Even me.

1019
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
Yeah.

1020
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
I'm dancing.

1021
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
I'm the honkyest white guy.

1022
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
You'll ever see it.

1023
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
And did you see me dancing?

1024
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,400
Yeah.

1025
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,400
Booga.

1026
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
Wow.

1027
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
It's raining even harder now.

1028
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,400
Yeah.

1029
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
People would think we're in the shower.

1030
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,400
Just listen.

1031
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
Listen.

1032
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,400
This is for a second.

1033
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
It's nice sound, isn't it?

1034
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Oh, you can turn your mic.

1035
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,400
Professional here.

1036
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Yeah.

1037
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Yeah.

1038
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
Yeah.

1039
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
Yeah.

1040
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
Thank you for your sound.

1041
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Sound Boogie.

1042
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
Yeah.

1043
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
Blow up.

1044
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
I put the mic down a little bit.

1045
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
Wasn't blow up that movie?

1046
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Blow out.

1047
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,400
Blow out.

1048
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
Blow out.

1049
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,400
That was it.

1050
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Oh, I love them.

1051
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Put your mic down just a little bit.

1052
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
Why?

1053
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
That's not why my mouth is.

1054
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
No.

1055
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,400
But what you do is you talk on the you look down and then it goes down past the mic.

1056
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Oh, okay.

1057
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
It's now at your nose.

1058
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Yeah.

1059
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,400
That was not.

1060
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
So you were.

1061
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
Saw John Travolta kissing a guy.

1062
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
Oh, yeah.

1063
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
Yeah.

1064
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,400
You showed me the picture.

1065
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,400
And I said, oh, yeah.

1066
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
Oh, yeah.

1067
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,400
Right.

1068
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Yeah.

1069
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
On the steps.

1070
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
Yeah.

1071
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
I bet he'd be really good.

1072
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
He's one of my favorite actors.

1073
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
He's really good.

1074
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
I love him.

1075
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Doesn't matter.

1076
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
I don't care if he wants rough sex with me.

1077
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,400
That doesn't matter.

1078
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
His own business.

1079
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
I'll have rough sex with John Travolta.

1080
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,400
Hey, I have a different sound now.

1081
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
Yeah.

1082
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
Because you're talking out of your nose.

1083
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
No, I'm not.

1084
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
Yeah.

1085
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,400
What did you do?

1086
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
I don't know what I did.

1087
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
No, I just moved it later.

1088
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,400
It's better now.

1089
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,400
Yeah.

1090
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
Told you.

1091
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,400
If you talk into it, it's better.

1092
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,400
We wanted to talk about.

1093
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
Richard Hammond.

1094
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
Right.

1095
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,400
So yes, they already talked about what happened to him.

1096
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,400
And everyone knows who he is.

1097
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
He's one of the, actually they call him hamster here.

1098
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,400
He's one of the co-presenters of the BBC's top kids.

1099
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,400
He's sort of a Dudley Moore kind of a,

1100
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Yeah, Dudley Moore.

1101
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
That's right.

1102
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,400
It vertically challenged.

1103
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,400
Yeah.

1104
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
But this is good.

1105
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
Hamster is a good description.

1106
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,400
Yeah.

1107
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Handsome.

1108
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
And also handsome.

1109
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,400
So we crashed in this jet powered car while doing,

1110
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
I think about 280 miles an hour.

1111
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
Test drive.

1112
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,400
For the TV show.

1113
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
Yeah.

1114
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
And so now what they're saying.

1115
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,400
More money.

1116
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,400
More money from you man.

1117
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,400
It's a charity.

1118
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,400
I'll call her back.

1119
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Okay.

1120
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
Where was I?

1121
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Test drive.

1122
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
You're right.

1123
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
So this, you have to imagine dragster.

1124
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
It flipped upside down.

1125
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,400
And you know, your head is basically in a roll bar cage.

1126
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,400
Okay.

1127
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
But that dragged through the grass upside down.

1128
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,400
So he got, you know, his face was basically being impacted by dirt and anything else

1129
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,400
that was being, you know, shoved into his face.

1130
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
God.

1131
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,400
So they say has a serious brain injury?

1132
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
Yes.

1133
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,400
And they, and they don't know whether he'll recover fully from that.

1134
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
Yeah.

1135
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,400
You know, you never know with brains.

1136
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,400
That's what it said in the paper.

1137
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,400
It's horrible because it's such a blow.

1138
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,400
I heard that it actually happened to Lady die.

1139
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,400
It's such a blow that your brains are shaking in your skull.

1140
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Of course.

1141
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,400
You know.

1142
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,400
And so the brain gets a blow, too.

1143
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,400
And he's in a different position.

1144
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
I'm sorry.

1145
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:32,400
I see that I bought the name.

1146
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,400
And I'm speaking Dutch to his banker.

1147
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,400
Very important right now, of course, for the, for the house.

1148
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
Yeah.

1149
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
He's really building something for him.

1150
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,400
See?

1151
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,400
Oh.

1152
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,400
Isn't it amazing?

1153
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,400
It just keeps on raining.

1154
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,400
It's about them bringing me money.

1155
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,400
Yeah, that's good.

1156
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
That's good.

1157
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
Bring the money.

1158
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
So yeah.

1159
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:57,400
So probably his, his brain, you know, had a huge blow.

1160
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,400
Yeah.

1161
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,400
Well, as I said yesterday, it's not speed that kills.

1162
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
It's lack of speed that kills.

1163
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,400
Yeah.

1164
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
And you need to be a pilot, actually.

1165
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,400
Well, they call it a pilot.

1166
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Yeah.

1167
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,400
Yeah.

1168
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,400
It doesn't mean you have, I mean the, yeah.

1169
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
Because you have to actually, because it wants to go up.

1170
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Of course.

1171
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,400
It's 280 miles an hour.

1172
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
You can fly.

1173
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Go so fast.

1174
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
You can fly.

1175
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,400
I mean, we fly at 60 miles an hour.

1176
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,400
That's when we take off.

1177
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,400
Yeah.

1178
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Yeah.

1179
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
So you have to keep the car down.

1180
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
Oh, yeah.

1181
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
No, how to do that.

1182
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
And he had was no experience.

1183
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,400
Well, so the conversation I had, or what I talked about yesterday is.

1184
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:35,400
I've done a lot of really life-threatening things for television.

1185
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,400
Yes.

1186
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,400
And, you know, a lot of people would say immediately, well, you know, you just

1187
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,400
want to do these dangerous things just to be famous or a star or whatever.

1188
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,400
But that's really, it's really not what it is.

1189
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,400
What happens is you get some kind of almost invincible feeling.

1190
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,400
Yeah.

1191
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,400
You know, like, I mean, you've done things, too, that, that have, for, for

1192
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,400
television or in show business.

1193
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
And I'm sure have not been the safest.

1194
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,400
Terrified.

1195
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Yeah.

1196
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,400
I've repelled down from the, a hoi, you know, huge stadium in, in Rotterdam.

1197
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,400
Yeah.

1198
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,400
I've, I've, I've done tons and tons of helicopter trips with.

1199
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,400
Of course.

1200
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,400
And as a senior, sometimes you have to stand somewhere up very high.

1201
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,400
Yeah.

1202
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,400
So start over there.

1203
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,400
Understand.

1204
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Yeah.

1205
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,400
Down to stairs.

1206
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
You know, there are builds just in a couple of hours.

1207
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
So they're not the good stairs.

1208
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,400
And I, and you think, you know, while you're seeing a look in the camera.

1209
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,400
Yeah.

1210
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
So, so.

1211
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,400
Very dangerous.

1212
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,400
Why do we do that?

1213
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,400
Why do we do this?

1214
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Why do you think you have to do that?

1215
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
But you don't actually.

1216
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,400
But what is it?

1217
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,400
What, I mean, because it just, it builds up and it builds up.

1218
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,400
And it, remember Kevin Celius through sporting fool, the same thing.

1219
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
Yeah.

1220
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
Yeah.

1221
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
The craziest, the craziest things.

1222
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,400
Well, once you did a couple of things, you think that nothing will, will happen.

1223
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
You're okay.

1224
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
You know what you're doing.

1225
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,400
I mean, all those, um, celebrity races I've participated in.

1226
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,400
Yeah.

1227
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
Yeah.

1228
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,400
That was some serious stuff.

1229
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,400
And he's not racing guy.

1230
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
He's not, you know.

1231
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
Of course not.

1232
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
But I mean, all you have to do is.

1233
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,400
He's a TV presenter.

1234
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
Why does he think he can do that?

1235
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Well, that's when I'm asking you.

1236
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
What is it?

1237
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
What is it?

1238
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,400
I don't know.

1239
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,400
What is it?

1240
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
Well, no fear.

1241
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,400
Interesting.

1242
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,400
And then I see those little too lovely two kids that he has.

1243
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,400
Two years old and I say, I'm fine.

1244
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,400
I'm fine.

1245
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,400
Yeah.

1246
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,400
Be beautiful.

1247
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,400
And I think don't you think about it?

1248
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,400
So have you ever been worried when I went off to do stuff?

1249
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Of course.

1250
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
Really?

1251
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,400
Yeah, of course.

1252
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,400
Do you remember anytime you were actually.

1253
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,400
Every time you fly.

1254
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,400
Well, besides the flying.

1255
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,400
But I mean, other stuff.

1256
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,400
I've been there.

1257
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
And think my husband is hanging there somewhere in the air.

1258
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,400
Really?

1259
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
Yeah.

1260
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,400
Sometimes I sit behind you and I think, what the hell am I doing?

1261
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,400
Really?

1262
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Why?

1263
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
I'm sitting here in a little tiny chair.

1264
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,400
I'm hanging somewhere in the air.

1265
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,400
You know, you think there's actually nothing there on the need.

1266
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,400
You don't want to think about it.

1267
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,400
You know?

1268
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,400
Okay.

1269
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,400
But I mean, besides that, I mean.

1270
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,400
People do that.

1271
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
You know.

1272
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
And once you do these things.

1273
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,400
You hang on anything.

1274
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,400
I've seen you in the air.

1275
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,400
And you take your camera with you.

1276
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
You know, you just do it.

1277
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,400
You're not afraid.

1278
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,400
No.

1279
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,400
You're not afraid.

1280
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
No.

1281
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,400
But you know, something like this happens.

1282
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,400
I'm like, wow, man.

1283
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,400
There's a lot of things.

1284
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,400
Like going to Iraq.

1285
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,400
That was another thing.

1286
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,400
I didn't have to do it.

1287
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
There was no reason to do it.

1288
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,400
Other than I wanted to do it.

1289
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,400
That also could have obviously had been potentially dangerous.

1290
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,400
We worried when we were in Iraq.

1291
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,400
Yeah.

1292
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,400
I know.

1293
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Where are you?

1294
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
What?

1295
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
Anything can happen.

1296
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,400
Anything.

1297
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Why would it happen to somebody else and not you?

1298
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,400
And then.

1299
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,400
And then only one time something really happened.

1300
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
That was the motorcycle.

1301
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
And you know that.

1302
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,400
Yeah.

1303
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,400
And you know when you do that's what I want to say.

1304
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,400
And you know when you do all these things.

1305
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,400
That will be one day.

1306
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,400
Did something will happen.

1307
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,400
And thank for and be very thankful that.

1308
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
Yeah.

1309
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,400
I think I got lucky.

1310
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,400
You got lucky.

1311
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
Yeah.

1312
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
I remember we came back because we had flown the helicopter there.

1313
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
And then we came back.

1314
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,400
I couldn't actually even fly the helicopter.

1315
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
And you still feel you back.

1316
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,400
Oh yeah.

1317
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
Absolutely.

1318
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
Oh definitely.

1319
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,400
Yeah.

1320
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,400
It's been two years ago.

1321
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
Oh you back.

1322
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
Three years ago almost.

1323
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,400
People.

1324
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,400
Human beings are so fragile.

1325
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Yeah.

1326
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,400
Just worthless pieces.

1327
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,400
Skin and bone shit.

1328
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Nicks.

1329
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Nicks.

1330
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,400
Nucks.

1331
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
All right.

1332
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Let's do some happy for a second.

1333
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
Yeah.

1334
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,400
Hi Adam.

1335
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,400
This is Tom from the Parkview podcast.

1336
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,400
And I thought I'd relate something to you that happened a while back.

1337
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,400
You had mentioned before about butterflies in your mom.

1338
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,400
And I always associate your mom.

1339
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
Now when I see butterflies.

1340
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,400
Well, it's not running about a week back.

1341
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,400
And I was doing one of my long runs.

1342
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,400
Kind of about a mile into my run.

1343
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,400
I was listening to the Daily Source Code.

1344
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,400
You and Patricia were on talking.

1345
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,400
And I know the sister fly started.

1346
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,400
She's running with me.

1347
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,400
She's tagging along.

1348
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,400
And this one was kind of odd because it actually stayed with me as I was running.

1349
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,400
And it probably stayed with me for about a mile and a half.

1350
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
And just kind of fluttering around.

1351
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,400
And almost like it was, he's dropping on the conversation.

1352
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
Or at least keeping me company.

1353
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,400
And then after about a mile and a half, it decided to take off.

1354
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,400
But it did remind me of your mom.

1355
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,400
And I thought I was kind of spitting that I was listening to.

1356
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,400
You have Drish Talk.

1357
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
Yeah.

1358
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,400
And I don't know what the subject was about.

1359
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
But it was almost like the butterfly was there.

1360
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,400
And kind of listening in and giving it a lot of approval.

1361
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
And then taking off.

1362
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
Isn't it nice?

1363
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
That's so nice.

1364
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
Yeah.

1365
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
I think those things.

1366
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,400
Yeah.

1367
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,400
I've got 25 of these people sending that in saying that they've had similar butterfly experiences.

1368
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
Yeah.

1369
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,400
Suddenly you, you know, sometimes they just lend on you.

1370
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,400
And they sit on you and I think, wow.

1371
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,400
And then you think about your mom.

1372
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,400
Well, yeah.

1373
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
That's what my mom always said.

1374
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,400
So if you chase a butterfly, you can never catch it.

1375
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,400
But if you just sit down.

1376
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
It'll sit down in your shoulder.

1377
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,400
Yeah.

1378
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,400
It's just sit with you.

1379
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,400
Yeah.

1380
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,400
True.

1381
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,400
So that's nice because you always remember your mom.

1382
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,400
Yeah.

1383
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,400
So actually once a year, at least when the butterfly's around.

1384
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,400
And when the butterfly's around.

1385
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,400
And when the butterfly's around.

1386
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,400
And now we are.

1387
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,400
Sometimes you see butterflies in magazines everywhere.

1388
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
True.

1389
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,400
It doesn't stop.

1390
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,400
It's almost like a Jamaican tropical rain.

1391
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:37,400
That rain is actually stronger and better than our shower.

1392
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,400
I wish it was this strong.

1393
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,400
This is a power shower.

1394
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,400
Once you go outside and take a shower.

1395
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,400
Yeah.

1396
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,400
Yeah.

1397
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,400
Let me film it for my video show.

1398
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,400
Come on.

1399
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,400
That'd be awesome, dude.

1400
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,400
Are you going to think else?

1401
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,400
Are you going to give anything else?

1402
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,400
Well, I'll play one more song.

1403
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Okay.

1404
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
And then we'll go back.

1405
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
Yeah.

1406
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,400
This is kind of interesting.

1407
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,400
I can't remember who recommended this.

1408
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,400
But I heard it and it kind of goes with the weather.

1409
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,400
Don't be late for the rest of your life.

1410
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,400
I'm not a butterfly.

1411
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,400
You have a chicken up.

1412
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:29,400
But every day I'm learning.

1413
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,400
The dreams were met for fools.

1414
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,400
It's all in some disco.

1415
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,400
No one ever wants to serve it.

1416
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,400
We're here.

1417
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:51,400
So don't beg for the rest of your life.

1418
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,400
This train leaves the tent.

1419
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,400
So you have to do this side.

1420
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:03,400
You're still telling what time I'm all right.

1421
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:10,400
So don't beg for the rest of your life.

1422
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,400
You're alive.

1423
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,400
Of course you was a child.

1424
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,400
But that crooked smile.

1425
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:27,400
She kept everyone waiting.

1426
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,400
Until there was no one.

1427
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,400
But that needed some.

1428
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,400
And he was always overstated.

1429
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:48,400
So don't beg for the rest of your life.

1430
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,400
Because more than it comes quickly.

1431
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,400
In the blink of an eye.

1432
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:01,400
This pretend my day will die.

1433
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:08,400
So don't beg for the rest of your life.

1434
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:18,400
For your expectation.

1435
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,400
I've thrown them away.

1436
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:29,400
You need for compassion.

1437
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:36,400
With this nothing.

1438
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:46,400
So don't beg for the rest of your life.

1439
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,400
So don't beg for the rest of your life.

1440
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,400
So don't beg for the rest of your life.

1441
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:02,400
So don't beg for the rest of your life.

1442
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:12,400
So don't beg for the rest of your life.

1443
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:18,400
So don't beg for the rest of your life.

1444
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,400
So don't beg for the rest of your life.

1445
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:26,400
So don't beg for the rest of your life.

1446
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:43,760
It's a goal to make all the rest of the rest of the rest of your life.

1447
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,400
How American is that?

1448
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:52,240
From Omaha, Nebraska, anonymous American, don't be late for the rest of your life.

1449
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,080
It's been Wayne's World podcast.

1450
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,480
You like it?

1451
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,080
Yeah, it was nice, wasn't it?

1452
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,200
That was very nice.

1453
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,360
I'd read a little bit.

1454
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,160
It's almost done.

1455
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,000
I'm sure you looked like you had something to say there.

1456
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:16,160
Well, there was something that just keeps on popping into my mind.

1457
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,400
Okay, here it comes.

1458
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:27,040
Um, should you let your teenager have a sleepover with her boyfriend?

1459
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,440
I know.

1460
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,720
I know.

1461
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,480
Well, I don't think we're going to get the answer in time.

1462
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,280
Because it's, uh, is it tonight?

1463
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,880
See, they're going to, if they want to do it, they're going to do it anyway.

1464
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,920
That's what I always have.

1465
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,040
Let's just back up for a second.

1466
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,760
This is, you or me, that's you.

1467
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:48,160
So this is, uh, Liam, who now has an apartment.

1468
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,320
No, not a apartment.

1469
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,360
We call an apartment.

1470
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:55,120
Well, no, he has a room, his own place.

1471
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,680
He's going to Gilford University, which, of course, is good.

1472
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,560
I encourage that.

1473
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,320
And he's in studying political sciences.

1474
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,040
That's good.

1475
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,800
He's for reasons why have to say.

1476
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,400
Yeah, he's still 21.

1477
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,200
He is.

1478
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,040
But for an English bloke, the drinking seems to be under control.

1479
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,640
No, he's not drinking anymore.

1480
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,160
He stopped for Christina.

1481
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,360
He stopped completely.

1482
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,840
Well, he, she said, you can have two drinks a day.

1483
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,240
That's it.

1484
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,560
Because we don't like it.

1485
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,680
We curse.

1486
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,320
Really?

1487
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,040
We curse.

1488
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:21,520
He said that.

1489
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,320
You didn't tell me this.

1490
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:22,880
I didn't get it.

1491
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,680
He just told me.

1492
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,080
Really?

1493
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,200
Yeah, she said, don't like it.

1494
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,840
Although, you know, he's not drunk or anything.

1495
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,960
But she doesn't like it.

1496
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:29,920
But he is responsible.

1497
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,160
He, he does look after her and do appreciate that.

1498
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:32,320
Yes.

1499
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:40,480
And, uh, and he, actually, we found out that he, so far, we think that he's a very nice guy.

1500
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:41,840
Yeah, he is.

1501
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,600
He's still fucking 21, you know?

1502
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,200
He's like that really bothers me.

1503
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,000
He's very sweet.

1504
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,200
Yeah, but it's still bothers me.

1505
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:47,600
Yeah.

1506
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,360
He's a young 21 year old.

1507
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:53,920
But, you know, you know, so Christina said,

1508
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,080
are I going to stay at Liam's house Friday night?

1509
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,840
Yep, I'm going to go out and then maybe stays.

1510
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,520
Is it going to go out too?

1511
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,760
Well, no, I think the idea of a romantic dinner at home is, is okay with me.

1512
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,160
But we're going to go out and then, and then we're going to go out.

1513
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,680
No, they're going to go to coffee shop.

1514
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,760
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1515
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,360
Or maybe a movie, I don't know.

1516
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,040
Or maybe they're going to watch a movie?

1517
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,360
So anyway, so first of all, she's legal.

1518
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:24,720
So she can do it, you know, she can do whatever she wants in this country, at least she's legal.

1519
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,880
And not legal for me.

1520
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,080
Yeah, and I think you're right, you know.

1521
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,200
They're going to do it anyway.

1522
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,240
And every time we said, okay, so that's, you know, uh,

1523
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,120
I just, you say your boyfriend, you know, okay, and then was over.

1524
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,000
Yeah, I guess what I'm worried about is I just don't want to become a habit.

1525
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,880
I just don't want it to be staying over there more and more and more and more.

1526
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,640
No, I said he's uh, uh, he's welcoming our house.

1527
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,560
And he did, because I, you know, I've been sleeping in the, in the guest bedroom.

1528
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,760
That's it, but um, yeah, you know.

1529
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,880
So how do you feel then?

1530
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,480
Actually, I, um, not bad, you know, it's different times.

1531
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,080
And, um, as I said, if they want to do it, they do it anyway.

1532
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:14,080
And, you know, better in a very relaxed, at a normal.

1533
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:19,040
Well, make sure she knows that if she, at any point, at any time wants me to come pick her up, I will.

1534
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,400
Yeah, we have to sell it.

1535
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,600
Even if it's the middle of the night.

1536
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,560
She wants to come home.

1537
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,840
Yeah, not a problem.

1538
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,320
We're there.

1539
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,440
No questions asked.

1540
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:25,760
No.

1541
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,360
Okay.

1542
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,880
I think I'm going to go slip my wrist now.

1543
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,280
Hang yourself.

1544
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,000
I think so.

1545
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,800
I think it's time.

1546
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,640
I got a question as very mature.

1547
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,120
I'm very intelligent, you know, I believe, I believe in her.

1548
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,000
I got to go call Bruce.

1549
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,360
Yeah.

1550
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,160
Okay, baby.

1551
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:42,320
Thank you.

1552
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,840
Well, you're welcome.

1553
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,880
Football Friday.

1554
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,360
Yeah.

1555
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,400
Football to you.

1556
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:46,880
Okay.

1557
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,640
You know, football to you too.

1558
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,840
Yeah.

1559
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,400
Football me.

1560
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,240
Okay, honey.

1561
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,440
Uh, we have a date tonight.

1562
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,880
Oh, yeah, we can go out.

1563
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,760
You make a reservation?

1564
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,480
Yes, I will.

1565
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,840
So that is, that is kind of an upside-down.

1566
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,800
Well, I said, let's wait.

1567
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,800
What's going to, what's going to happen with the house?

1568
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,120
Yeah.

1569
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,160
Well, that sounds like a plus.

1570
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,120
I think we can celebrate.

1571
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,160
We can celebrate.

1572
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:04,560
Okay.

1573
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,200
Exactly.

1574
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:05,760
Sushi.

1575
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:06,720
Sushi.

1576
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,920
And would she like to be the elephant tonight?

1577
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,880
And stand all my friends.

1578
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,520
Standing your chest?

1579
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,120
Might, might trunk mine.

1580
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:15,920
You're in the face.

1581
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,520
All right.

1582
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,560
Yes, you got a date.

1583
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,040
Okay.

1584
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:21,680
I love you, baby.
