00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Hi, this is Ella's Death from The Eclipse podcast, and I'd just like to wish everyone

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,160
at btpodshow.com a very merry Christmas and a happy and prosperous 2007.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,320
You know, I had two beers last night. That's why I'm all discombobulated. Two whole beers.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,680
You know what that does to me, right? It's the DSC 520 with your lush Adam Kerr.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,000

Oh yeah.

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I think you should shine on another World Cup!

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,940
If you'd told me it was the chili peppers

75
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,940
I would believe you wouldn't believe you in a heartbeat.

76
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,920
Of course it's not when the pardoncing music

77
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,740
now work at stereotype file with bass.

78
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,160
Hey everybody! How you doing?

79
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,680
Coming to you once again from the soon to be for cottage formerly known as curry cottage. I'm sorry

80
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,960
The dwelling formerly known as the curry cottage in the affluent suburb of Surrey known as Guilford

81
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,880
It is the daily source code episode 520 still having some some issues talking today

82
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,040
Yeah after the show I was I'm pretty happy I did the show before I went to the to the dentist yesterday

83
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,040
Until I went to visit Fiona

84
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,880
Had a nice little root canal done yesterday

85
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
I knew it was coming I knew it

86
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,640
So essentially my my cheekbone is infected

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,640
It's the pre-molar that that is died off and I'm no big hero when it comes to the dentist

88
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:33,800
Let me tell you that now in fact, I'm a big fucking pussy and there's only really two things I have a problem with

89
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,000
one is the actual insertion of the

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,160
Nova K needle particularly if I already have pain in my mouth. I'm not too fond of that

91
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,360
Although that's just you know like

92
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,160
It's just the thought of it once it actually happens. It's no problem

93
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,480
But then the really thing I'm really afraid of because I've had this happen so many times is that I won't

94
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,280
Have enough numbness and that the dentist will be drilling away

95
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:06,120
And then all of a sudden we'll like shoot through something like some new plateau and then you know that that drill goes into far and then the pain

96
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,840
She shoots throughout your head so that fucking explodes

97
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,760
I've had that happen so many times I really really to test that

98
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,360
But Fiona's great Fiona

99
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,760
understands me and

100
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,160
And she knows that what I like the most is if I heard it basically walk me through it all and just tell me every single step of the way

101
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,480
What you're doing I enjoyed immensely you know I love to hear about the different lengths in

102
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,320
Files and the drill bits and the electric one and the hydraulic one and

103
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,960
And I learn a lot and it keeps me occupied and she's you know, and of course she she had to swear to me that

104
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,160
That I wasn't going to experience any more pain

105
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,840
There was funny because she was trying to figure out what was wrong, you know, but so

106
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,240
Essentially she had to drill into the tooth which

107
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:58,120
There was a filling there from years and years ago and of course that it that had probably leaked throughout the years and that's how the

108
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,960
How the root

109
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,960
became infected and and probably died off slowly the tooth was basically dead

110
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,520
But before she went drilling in there

111
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
She was tapping around

112
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,640
So funny she's like okay, does this hurt?

113
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,640
I said no really it's my cheek that hurts more, but I know that's related to I thought it was my canine

114
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,520
But that's actually the

115
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,080
The infection was above the canine even though it was part of the root of the pre-mull are right behind it

116
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,880
We're a teeth family, you know that I love teeth

117
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,960
And

118
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,960
So she's tapping with the back of one number instruments, you know like really like like this like

119
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,800
You know hard, you know, it's just this that tenda and it takes it again is that tenda and I like well, you know

120
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,520
It's all right doesn't hurt too much, but she said hmm

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,160
Besides the guy you profanive have you taken anything else that might have numb the pain

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,160
I just want the big fat one away to the dentist like

123
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,240
What ever could you mean Fiona she knows she knows I smoked the holy herb

124
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,800
I think she was referring to any other substances was said no, but I was like I didn't hurt too much at all

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,400
Anyway, so she took care of business and I'm on massive any biotics in fact the people used to die from this

126
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Before the invention of pelicent and a cylinder of course people used to die from all kinds of infections

127
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,840
But if you got an infection like a root canal and it went into your into your bone

128
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,880
Which is essentially where the infection has gone in my case

129
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,520
You know you could die and people used to

130
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,600
The whole thing with dentistry is just so mid-evil you know

131
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,800
It's like a just a leftover

132
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,200
thing, you know

133
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:44,200
With pliers and files and drill bits and shit. Yeah, there's this great technology involved, but

134
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,720
And I learned something too

135
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
She had to take an x-ray and

136
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
You know, which consists of

137
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,960
Putting that yucky piece of plastic film on your mouth on a holder while she leaves the room to

138
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,400
Desap the machine

139
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,760
Said you know haven't they come up with a digital variety of this yet?

140
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,360
I mean make so much sense

141
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,080
She said well, they do they do have one so you didn't so there's no more a development of

142
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,400
photographic film

143
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
so it is a a digital

144
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,160
I guess

145
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,360
x-ray receiver

146
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,480
She says but it's really impractical for two reasons

147
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,720
One is

148
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,400
It's thick so already you know these things are pretty big you've had it in your mouth

149
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,760
Have you had it in your mouth?

150
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,240
Well, if you had it in your mouth, you know what I'm talking about

151
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,760
But it's also in you know those are pretty thin pieces of film

152
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,760
But this one she she showed me it was about

153
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:42,040
Probably about three quarters of a centimeter thick and she says just almost impossible for to keep people to keep that in their mouth

154
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,040
In addition to that

155
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,360
There's a U.S.-B cable hanging out of your face where it just is not very convenient

156
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm sure that they'll they'll bundle that on to one memory card pretty soon

157
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,560
Well, that's fun so I have to go back the second of January because now the infection has to basically

158
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,560
Subside so I'm on two different types of antibiotics no drinking by the way during this process

159
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,080
So that kind of rules out any even champagne on new years which as you know is not a big deal for me

160
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:19,880
But still so while that maintenance was taking place on the way back the jag the super v8 flashed a warning message saying

161
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,240
What was it air suspension

162
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,080
malfunction I'm like that doesn't sound good

163
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,280
So I had a really good experience you know I've had the outies and I've had Mercedes and the service on both of those

164
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:40,360
Mercedes being absolute by far and away the worst and outie being you know so so so so

165
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,560
Called up a H.A. Fox here in Guilford where I purchased the the super v8

166
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,440
I said all right here's what's going on. I said well come on in tomorrow that would be this morning 10 a.m

167
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,760
And it was great you know walk in and say how you doing up mr. Curry have a cup of coffee

168
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,160
Can I have your keys you know within seconds the guys driven this driven the car into the garage

169
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,240
20 minutes comes back well there was a technical service bulletin

170
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,400
And you know of course it's all under warranty will take care of everything and you bring the car back in the 15th

171
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,840
We'll give you replacement car it was so nice so efficient and I do understand now

172
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:24,120
Why Elton John sir Elton John has all of his maintenance done regardless of car by the way at this particular garage in in Guilford H

173
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,040
You know we say H and I hear the Brits say H

174
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:34,040
Not quite sure where that came from anyway H.A. Fox they have a fantastic service department

175
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,080
Real happy about that and and it's where Elton has all his vehicles serviced

176
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:47,320
So yeah my face is still swollen hurts. It's not a pretty site actually

177
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,560
Yesterday we learned that former president Gerald Ford died

178
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,880
H 93 nice age I have to say if you got to go

179
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,440
But I learned so much watching several news reports

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You know I was pretty young when he was president and

181
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,440
All I really only knew two things about him. I've never studied him or you know

182
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Ever really ever thought about him other than oh that's the guy who filled in when Nixon got kicked out

183
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,200
Then that and and that's the goofy guy

184
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,320
That filled in when Nixon got kicked out

185
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,000
He wasn't quite that goofy as it turns out

186
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,480
In fact, he was very athletic

187
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,840
Quite a scholar

188
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,120
But he was always portrayed I think by the press as this bumbling idiot

189
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:41,480
And I'm really happy that that I learned a little bit more about him and and I've started to look around and read up on him

190
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,320
And he did some pretty interesting things in fact now you're seeing posthumously people are praising him which is very nice

191
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,960
But you know

192
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,600
It's goes to show man how long shit can stick to you

193
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,720
Because I was convinced that he was just a goofy guy who just kind of hung in there for a

194
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
For a couple of years

195
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,080
Man more presidential news

196
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,080
Now this is very interesting let me

197
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,840
Let me bring up the the video for you

198
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:16,040
This is from YouTube which was shot yesterday apparently by Andrew Barron of rocket boom fame

199
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
I'm going to a YouTube page right now

200
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,800
Check this out. I'm John Edwards and I'm in the upper ninth ward of New Orleans where

201
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,600
We've been working this afternoon and I'll be along with these kids who are working behind me

202
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,200
I try to restore a home those that was devastated by the hurricane and tomorrow morning from this place

203
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,440
So what you're seeing here is John Edwards in front of it almost looks like he's in Africa

204
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,520
You know this dirt and and like a hut behind him and it's actually

205
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,600
housing in

206
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
New Orleans in Louisiana

207
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,280
All right to here comes

208
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,240
I'll announce that I'm a candidate for president United States

209
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,000
What I will do is ask millions of Americans including you

210
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,000
To join me in taking action and taking responsibility

211
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,560
Not sitting around waiting for somebody else to do it, but actually going out and doing it ourselves

212
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:15,640
So the first of all, I think it's very cool that he denounced the announcement of his announcement for president for running for president

213
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:22,920
On YouTube that makes a lot of sense. However, I'm a little confused now because looking through the bloggo sphere

214
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,720
I see that Robert Scobel

215
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,360
You know he was

216
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
I apparently had been invited

217
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:37,080
To be a part of the announcement which takes place today and you can follow that on the scobalyzer weblog

218
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,880
And you'll see that

219
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,440
He was very secretive about what it was going to do and and then he said oh well shit

220
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:49,160
It looks like the announcement was already made indeed. I'm going to be following or be traveling along with

221
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
with presidential hopeful

222
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,400
John Edwards

223
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
and then I read on

224
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,720
Andrew Barron

225
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,760
Who produces rocket boom. I read on his weblog

226
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,920
That he actually filmed this pre-announcement and put it up on YouTube interesting not on

227
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,440
Interesting enough not on his own feed or on the rocket boom feed, but on the John Edwards YouTube page

228
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,640
And so excuse me with some split up

229
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,200
So it sounds to me

230
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,200
Like like both these guys and perhaps more video bloggers

231
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:34,280
We're invited exclusively to cover this announcement and to to ride along with the with the Edwards campaign

232
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,720
But they certainly did not know that there were other quote exclusive

233
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,280
Reporters and

234
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:49,560
It's going to be very interesting to follow this so it seems like the Edwards campus in synonym decks has made a conscious decision to involve bloggers and

235
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,880
And video bloggers in the process of the campaign which I think is fantastic

236
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,520
But now I want to see how good we're going to be are we really going to be able to ask the and I say we as in we the peeps

237
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,600
Citizen journalists are we going to be able to ask the tough questions. Do we know enough about the issues at hand?

238
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,960
And already it seems like there's some confusion here. You know, was someone supposed to have an exclusive

239
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,280
Why the secrecy why couldn't anyone say anything

240
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:21,000
Speaking of Andrew Barron he's he announced they uh, I should look this up for you

241
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,720
He announced a new initiative

242
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,080
Hold on, let me just go to his page. What is it? Dembot?

243
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,080
I think them yet dembot.com

244
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,240
He's announced the new initiative called Abby Studios and

245
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,360
Of course this caught my eye or should I say caught my vanity filters

246
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:47,800
He did a blog post here on Christmas day. I've spent quite some time investigating pod show and pod tech. Uh-oh

247
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:55,720
Colombo on the trail. I've watched both of them form and grow. I've met the people behind the businesses and I've asked a lot of questions

248
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,280
Okay, well, we certainly

249
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,760
Met a couple times don't remember a lot of questions

250
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,120
uh

251
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,240
Anyway, so uh, there's uh, what does he call it?

252
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,000
Abby Studios not intended to be a brand network for shows that's a creative studio for people

253
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,800
So um, very interested to see what comes out of that and he's doing it with

254
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:25,640
Jeff Palmer who I know from the early internet days we certainly emailed a lot back and forth and they've really got to do anything together

255
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,840
So okay, we'll see

256
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,800
I have learned though that announcing that kind of stuff online, you know something that big and then having a

257
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,520
A web page up that adjusts his empty. Let me see if he's done anything with it. Abby

258
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,160
Uh

259
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,440
No, it still says Abby core. Yeah

260
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,960
You know people get you know you announce something like that. That's pretty lofty goal, you know

261
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:55,240
It sounds like he's got something pretty big cooking. I'm very interested to see what what his idea is

262
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,560
and how much it'll differ from what we're doing

263
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,760
But uh, you know, so far a lot of talk

264
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:10,040
So and I've learned that you can't really talk too much. You got to kind of show something after a while people get really antsy

265
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,040
And then they start to post negative shit

266
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,880
I've changed uh, yet again some stuff in the setup here

267
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,400
uh, p-dub

268
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:23,160
Notice that there was something distinctly out of phase about my voice and it's own it only happens when I'm hooked up to the

269
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,480
To the stereo valve processor here at home and not one of them in San Francisco in my other home

270
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,520
So I've reversed the phase on the microphone. I don't know if you can tell or not or if it makes any difference to you

271
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,400
But we've entered into this fascinating conversation about about microphone

272
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,080
Techniques and measurements and and and and really it's probably something you can't hear anyway

273
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:53,960
And the only piece I have today that I want to play for you that comes from the outside world is a bit of a shocker

274
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,120
um

275
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,040
Now maybe it's not a bit of a shocker, but it does give me a little more insight

276
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,840
Into the ongoing saga

277
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,720
Okay, I don't know who this is but stop fucking calling jizzell asshole

278
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,720
Well, we know who this guy is now listen to the latest

279
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,400
Message from jizzell hi Adam it's jizzell

280
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,240
I'm sorry I haven't been in touch. I've had a lot going on

281
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,240
Long story short. I left my husband and

282
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,520
It's okay. I'm in a better place now

283
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,040
But I just wanted to let you know that I've been thinking about you

284
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,600
Even though I can't listen to your show where I am

285
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:39,640
But I've really been thinking a lot about you and I miss you and I will hopefully be in touch soon

286
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,640
Okay, I'll be you. Bye

287
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,480
Wow

You know what was kind of freaking that message? She said oh, I hear listen to this. Let me just see if I try and and

289
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,240
It's okay. I'm an investment

290
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,240
Okay, let's listen to this and

291
00:18:54,040 --> 00:19:01,320
It's okay. I'm in a better place now. It's okay. I'm in a better place now. That's what you say about people who are dead. That's horrible

292
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,560
Let me see I got some other stuff I want to talk about today

293
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,920
But first here's one this is a nice piece of email I got from David Manders

294
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,080
Who by the way had a similar experience to myself over the festive period except on his uh

295
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:29,960
Was it doesn't say which tooth put he had a root canal? He's been on antibiotics for six days really tough for a Brit

296
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,760
No drinking

297
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,560

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:58,080
Coming to the PMN January 8 is the shakes I want a better life

324
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,080
Here on your daily source code thank you to Stewart Hunter who was paying attention

325
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,080
Here that I got Christina Nintendo DS light he says one game you should pick up is brain age

326
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,080
It's a great application that test your reactions to various puzzles gives you your brain age or how old your brain is

327
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:20,080
And frequent use of the app is supposed to make you more intelligent an excellent game I shall pick one up at one of those up

328
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:26,080
What it should really do is it should you know you should give that to your to your kid having played and then it should connect to the internet

329
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,080
And send send the information to the parents that's kind of bad isn't it?

330
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,080
I think about it.

331
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:47,080
Let's see another controversy or controversy Google apparently has stopped providing many of the erotic and sex blogs in their in their search results

332
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:54,080
I got a post a link from violet blue on in the show notes about that you have to take a look at it's a very interesting story

333
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,080
And it makes me feel even more happy that we start up this erotic a channel with pod show

334
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:08,080
Because it's going to be tough for you know when you get companies like Google who are you know deciding what is and is not good for you

335
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:15,080
And I know that violet blue tiny nipples dot com I know she's got plenty of inbound links and then her page ranks should be way up there

336
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,080
But apparently you got to read the whole story because it's just little it's a little too intricate to explain

337
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:28,080
Quite frankly I'm not quite sure how it works, but I know that they're not showing up in search results the way they used doing a lot of blogs are showing up

338
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:38,080
So if you're checking us out on serious satellite stars channel go to daily source code dot com download the rest of the show I guarantee you

339
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,080
You won't be disappointed

340
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,080
Finally got an invite to Facebook

341
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:51,080
I thought you couldn't get on Facebook unless you had a dot edu email address, but I got an invite so I immediately filled it out

342
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,080
We're shuddled right off got in no problem, but I was really disappointed

343
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:03,080
First of all I thought it was the way they you know complete your registration and then they right off the bat

344
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,080
They pre filled out my my Gmail email address

345
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:16,080
And they said I'll just enter your password and we'll automatically suck down your fucking address book and email it to everybody

346
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:22,080
Now I know that this is the the virality feature, but I felt the way they presented it was very very tricky

347
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,080
It was not clear at all that you're about to spam all of your friends and if you're

348
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:32,080
You know if you're someone who just likes to you know run get through the registration process quickly

349
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:38,080
And it almost appears like you have to fill out that that piece of the of information before you can continue

350
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:45,080
So I figured out you didn't have to as I said it wasn't very apparent and then I went searching but like okay, I'll look for classmates nothing

351
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,080
And maybe I'm just too fucking old

352
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,080
There's like nothing at all

353
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,080
I know I looked at Salem College, which is now known as Salem International

354
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,080
There's no one on there since you know before the class of 2004

355
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,080
Come on, you know we got to get back to the 80s with this stuff

356
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,080
Crap

357
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:14,080
Oh, well, how did this I was gonna play a song for you, but it looks like a cute up the wrong one, hold on a second

358
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:26,080
So anyway, so if if you went to Salem College in 1983 so if you were the class of 85 or 86

359
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:36,080
Send me a message on Facebook, I'm in there as I don't curry. I just maybe I'm not maybe I'm not using a ride or maybe I'm I haven't

360
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:44,080
Just I don't know it's like this is supposed to be the hot social network for people who want to hook up with people they really used to know and

361
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:51,080
You know the real networks of people who are connected to each other it just didn't happen for me. Maybe I need to take a little more spend a little more time and work on it

362
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,080
But it'll surprise

363
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,080
You know what it's Thursday

364
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,080
Did not receive an exercise

365
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,080
So in lieu of that give some Kelly Brock cowboy boots and Levi

366
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:28,080
He can turn you on with the way give a night in his cowboy boots and Levi

367
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,080
In his cowboy boots and Levi

368
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,080
Everything just a little more

369
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,080
It's one of the reasons I can't decide so

370
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,080
We're about to say everything without a legit thing

371
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,080
We're going to play this song again

372
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,080
When he walks on stage, he's ready to burn

373
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,080
Every I follows every entrance under the lights

374
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,080
Y'all boys are robbing his cowboy boots and Levi

375
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,080
In his cowboy boots and Levi

376
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,080
And everything just a little more

377
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,080
It's one of the reasons I can't talk to her

378
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,080
And perhaps everything without a legit thing

379
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,080
We're going to play this song, can't say

380
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,080
So in lieu of that give some Kelly Brock cowboy boots and Levi

381
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,080
He can turn you on with the way give a night in his cowboy boots

382
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,080
And everything just a little more it's one of the reasons I can't decide so

really like it cowboy boots and Levi's and before I go I just want to talk to you briefly

423
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,720
about the best of the Charlie's as you know we're moving house starting the first week

424
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,520
of January some next week we'll be packing up and moving all the way through to the second

425
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:59,640
week of January we'll be moving in moving from the east side to the west side moving on up

426
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:06,920
everybody. So I've already asked PW up to fill in for me on this serious and what I wanted

427
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:12,520
to do is have some best of Charlie's rollout and I've already got three that I've received. Here's

428
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:17,160
what I'd like to do. I need seven more. Send me an email telling me what you want to do what the idea

429
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,280
is that to be about 24 minutes. Actually no a preferably no longer than 24 minutes and 30 seconds

430
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:29,480
because then we can actually use those both on the on the podcast feed dedicated source code.com

431
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:35,560
and we can put them straight on to serious satellite tell me what your idea is. I'll confirm it with you

432
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:40,040
so that we don't run into any trouble where you know we have more people producing them then we

433
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:44,440
actually have airtime for although of course I could keep putting them on the feed no problem but

434
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,520
and you know there's some pretty creative ideas that people are coming up with so please

435
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:55,000
if you're so inclined I would I would love for you to help me out and I'm sure we can do

436
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,600
something like send you some fucking whack-out pod show t-shirt as thanks but know that it is really

437
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:10,120
appreciated and remember January 12th new movie coming out stomp the yard and we have a podcast

438
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:15,160
all about the movie itself. I want you to go listen to that it's at stompthepodcast.com

439
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:20,360
Tony Costas of Costas World gets us rolling with the first installment is the second installment

440
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:28,440
out yet I wonder. So I just take a look for a second stomp the hey it's not auto completing

441
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:34,040
usually and I guess I haven't looked at it in three days. How long has it taken till those

442
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:41,400
URLs those auto complete URLs expire in fire fox. Let's see stomp the podcast.

443
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:48,040
Okay now it looks like it's waiting for the poo poo studios.com which is usually an indication

444
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:54,520
of the poo poo player. That's pop a uniform pop uniform. Man how much is that suck?

445
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,680
So the page is not loading because I can see it right here it says waiting for poo poo studios.com

446
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:07,080
and so that's the poo poo player. You know what an exercise in branding? The poo poo player,

447
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:14,440
the fuck this is horrible. Does not even loading? Oh man. Shit. All right I want to look into that.

448
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,200
Well if you get to it successfully let me know what the poo poo player worked. I got to talk

449
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,200
to Tony about that shit man that's not right. All right everybody so tomorrow of course it

450
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:31,160
will be our food bar Friday edition. The crap is tomorrow the last one before the new year. I got to do

451
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,720
a special year end so I don't know if I'll be able to produce everything for tomorrow. Otherwise I'll

452
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:41,000
do it over the weekend before January 1 because I do want to do something a little different. I want

453
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,560
to have a you know kick and ask way to say goodbye to 2006. If you've got any songs of

00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:52,600
