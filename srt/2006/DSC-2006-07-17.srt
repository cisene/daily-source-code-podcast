00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,600
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,440
Hello, cameras. Remember, Monday is malaria day.

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,480
That's my time to take that big orange pill and get ready for the whole team in Tuesday.

12

We will happy to meet you as Lisa.

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,860
I just become

14
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,460
I burst in from heart

15
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,660
It's the most begin

16
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:45,660
I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here, I am here,

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,160
For my sight, for every life that shines

00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,660
Shadow of the world

20
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,660
I am here, I am here

21
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,660
I am there where you're sleeping

22
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,660
I am lying, I am lying

23
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:47,660
I am there for every life that shines

24
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:55,660
I am there where you're sleeping

I am there for every life that shines

36
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:39,660
I am there for every life that shines

37
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,660
I think he's done again

00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,660
I am there for every life that shines

57
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,660
I am there for every life that shines

00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,660
I am there for every life that shines

59
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,660
I am there for every life that shines

60
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:43,660
I am there for every life that shines

61
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:53,660
I am there for every life that shines

62
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:59,660
I am here for every life that shines

63
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,020
an airport called South End, which is a mid-sized field.

64
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,940
They take heavy metal there as well.

65
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,500
And I knew the captain Dan wouldn't be able to fly

66
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,580
safety pilot with me on Sunday.

67
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,220
And I couldn't get Jason, who's been flying with me before

68
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,820
because he had to work in the tower.

69
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,060
So I said, you know what, why don't we alter our flight plan

70
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,780
on the way back?

71
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,180
That's from Antwerp to Farrowks.

72
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,300
We'll stop off at South End.

73
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,940
Then we'll have seen the airport and I'll feel a little more

74
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,140
confident.

75
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,780
And so we did that and everything went fine.

76
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,180
And I, oh, man, fucking impeccable landing.

77
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,380
A greaser as Captain Dan called it just nice and smooth,

78
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,460
barely felt me touched down.

79
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,820
And I hadn't told Patricia that I'd actually never

80
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,620
flown solo in this aircraft ever before.

81
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,620
Well, you know, because the missions have always been to Antwerp,

82
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,740
which, as I said, is that a lot you have to do

83
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,380
as a reasonable amount of work that has to go on,

84
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,460
particularly communicating with air traffic control,

85
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,580
that at least six different people you have to talk to

86
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,220
and watch out for other idiots who are flying around on the weekend.

87
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,260
Of course, who don't talk to anybody and just seem to fly around

88
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,500
it will.

89
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
So it was a beautiful day, Sunday.

90
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:16,580
It was about 10 miles per hour of wind coming just from the north,

91
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,380
north east.

92
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,300
So actually perfect for South End because they have a 0, 6,

93
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,420
2, 4 runway so you can literally fly right in.

94
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,140
And off we went, first time together,

95
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,740
we've never been in the plane together alone either.

96
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,220
So of course, we did a little semi-mile,

97
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,220
mile high club thing at 2,400 feet.

98
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,540
So it didn't really count.

99
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,100
And it was really just a kiss because damn there's a lot of work

100
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,260
to do in that continent.

101
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,740
So I flew Patricia out, you know, great, dropped her off at South End.

102
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,620
Everything was perfect.

103
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,220
Now on the way back, as I said, I'd never soloed in this aircraft

104
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,420
before, of course, I flown solo because you have to in order

105
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,380
to get your license, but I never actually landed it with just myself.

106
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,020
And I didn't really think about it because, you know,

107
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:06,020
I guess typically I've always had minimum of two people and

108
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,580
oftentimes four and it behaves differently, you know,

109
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,980
because of the way, it's very obvious.

110
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,900
And it doesn't matter, Patricia's not heavy,

111
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,940
but you could just put 20 pounds in the right hand front seat

112
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,900
and it will make a difference.

113
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,980
But I just wasn't thinking of it.

114
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,700
So I'm coming in for a few, because I dropped her off,

115
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,460
I was going to fly back to some grocery shopping

116
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,860
and then go pick her up at the end of the day.

117
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,700
And I come in for the landing and everything's perfect.

118
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,700
And all of a sudden, it just like, because it was so light,

119
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,860
I configured it a little bit differently.

120
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,020
And I start to bounce and start to pour up around

121
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,620
and so I call it go around and I fly around, try to do it again.

122
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,820
Another oscillating bounce, like, oh, wait a minute.

123
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,020
Of course, I'm much lighter.

124
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,780
So the third time, of course, being a charm,

125
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,580
and I dropped it onto the tarmac.

126
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,180
And as you know, as we say in aviation,

127
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,060
if you walk away from the landing, it was a fantastic landing.

128
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,060
But what was really nice is that Jason, as I said,

129
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,020
he couldn't come flying with me.

130
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,300
He was in the tower.

131
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,020
And so he's, of course, watching this, you know,

132
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,860
watching me, like a fucking flipper, a Cirque de Soleil moves.

133
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,300
They're trying to get the plane on the landing strip.

134
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,060
And I'm like, oh, Jason, I'm going around on this one.

135
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,180
He says, oh, it's all right, man.

136
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,060
And it happens to all of us.

137
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,100
He was really nice.

138
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,020
It was so nice to have that kind of reassuring,

139
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,300
don't worry about it, dude.

140
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,740
We're not laughing at you here.

141
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,020
And of course, he was laughing at me,

142
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:22,420
but at least he wasn't humiliating me publicly.

143
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,460
And I had kind of neglected to mention

144
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,100
the Patricia that I'd never soloed in the aircraft,

145
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,380
but she had a great time.

146
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,500
It was so nice.

147
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,020
You know, so I picked her up and we flew back

148
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:36,580
and that whole bit from South End to about big and hill.

149
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,820
It is, you know, there's relatively no traffic.

150
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,740
You can see London right off in the distance

151
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,340
because you're flying over the Thames

152
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,940
at the last bit of the Thames there.

153
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,620
It's completely smooth air.

154
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,580
It was just wonderful.

155
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,220
And we had a great time and landed without bouncing.

156
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,380
You know, one of Adam's typical plump were downlandings,

157
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,820
but it was without bouncing.

158
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
I just, I did call to the tower and said, Jason,

159
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,180
I might wheel still on and said, yeah, we either still there.

160
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,740
But Patricia said she definitely wanted to do more.

161
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,660
And I'm very happy because how cool is it

162
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,460
when you can take your bride and hop into your plane

163
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,260
and fly somewhere else completely different.

164
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,260
So when I get back from San Francisco, leaving tomorrow,

165
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,820
for it's actually so it's a week,

166
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,180
but when you take travel and everything,

167
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,780
it's probably nine or 10 days.

168
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,180
Because we've got a board meeting coming up on Wednesday,

169
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,300
which I'm very excited about.

170
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,460
And we're now we're really kicking to gear.

171
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,980
Now that Podshow Plus is stable and we're fixing all the bugs,

172
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,420
we have some interface, some redistisions to make.

173
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,580
And of course, we're going to start getting down

174
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,820
with, you know, building up the network

175
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,860
and bringing people in.

176
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,500
And we're going to be organizing registered listener drives

177
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,740
and all kinds of amazing stuff that anybody

178
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,580
can participate in, whether you're a podcast,

179
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,420
but probably more importantly, if you're a listener,

180
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,140
you can participate in helping the growth of the network

181
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,820
by helping out your favorite podcast.

182
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,740
And actually, yeah, making some coin while you're at it.

183
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,060
My sister put up another podcast.

184
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,380
She's willow.podshow.com and her podcast is Italy.podshow.com.

185
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,780
And she does a podcast called from the,

186
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,380
from the Hills of Florence, Italy.

187
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,100
And her first one, she had a messed up microphone,

188
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,460
but now she's got her, her mic set up,

189
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,060
her husband did a little jingle for.

190
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,980
And I'm just, I'm loving it.

191
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,420
You know, for all for the years that I've been podcasting

192
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,620
and tinkering around with stuff.

193
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,500
And she's very technical.

194
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
She does, she's a PHP programmer.

195
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,340
And you don't hear a lot of programmers actually create podcast.

196
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,140
Now that I think of it, you know,

197
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,540
for her to jump on means that, you know,

198
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,660
I think we did something right with, with podshow plus.

199
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,460
It makes sense.

200
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,740
Of course, there's all kinds of shit that we have to take care of.

201
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,060
Hey, we'll be discussing a little bit of that in this episode

202
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,780
of the Daily Source Code for two, two.

203
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,300
And some other shit, literally.

204
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,500
Adam, this is Ed Stofel here of the Flying Reports podcast

205
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,900
at flyingreports.com.

206
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,500
I want to thank you so much for all your work with the podshow team

207
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,100
for getting the site up and running.

208
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,860
It's a great concept.

209
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,380
And now that it's a public beta,

210
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,660
you'll know that find lots of technical issues.

211
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,500
I've made a podshow wish list and posted it online

212
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,180
in my section of podshow.

213
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,020
Most of them are technical.

214
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,860
I haven't figured out how to use the so-called vacuum feature

215
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,900
to upload my podcast files to podshow,

216
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,100
but the problem has been referred to one of the sites developers

217
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,900
to figure out the problem, and I'm sure he will.

218
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:33,380
I do wish there was a way to merge all these different IDs and pages.

219
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,180
Let's say I now have a music sign in.

220
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,020
My page at podshow, a podcast page name.

221
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,620
It does get a little confusing.

222
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,700
And when I picked my podshow name, I thought I was picking a name

223
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,700
for where the show would live.

224
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,820
But now I have to pick a different page for my show.

225
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,220
So that gets all little confusing.

226
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,940
The team, though, has obviously spent a lot of time

227
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,660
developing features that people will want.

228
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,180
And I do appreciate that.

229
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,140
And I'm confident that they will be able to solve the technical issues.

230
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,100
And I'm hoping they incorporate some of the ideas that users are submitting.

231
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,380
So thanks again, Adam, and tailwinds, dude.

232
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,820
Yeah, tailwinds back at you.

233
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,180
And did I have some yesterday?

234
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,860
Let me tell you, saw 170 knots ground speed digging it.

235
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,460
So all you're list, thank you very much.

236
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,420
Good stuff in there.

237
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,420
And of course, yes, we take everything,

238
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,820
and try to communicate as much as possible

239
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,220
in as many different places as possible.

240
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,540
I'm seeing Joe Carpenter show up on the Curry.com comments.

241
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,620
And Mark and Steve, the emo social network boys,

242
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:41,860
so almost anywhere that you're getting this information out,

243
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,580
we are definitely doing things with it.

244
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,340
I agree that it was a bit confusing.

245
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,420
It seems that even though the language was pretty clear,

246
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,540
I think it was clear, because we did go over this several times.

247
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,260
Still a lot of people really thought we were coming out

248
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,580
with some kind of thing for podcasters.

249
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,140
And I can't stress enough that we built this for audience.

250
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,620
And for people who want to enjoy podcasters.

251
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,620
And of course, we tried to put as much

252
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,740
of the good thinking into the podcast creation side,

253
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,820
not just for people who've been podcasting for a while,

254
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,500
but also for people who just are new to this,

255
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,540
come in as a listener, and then decide

256
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,940
they want to make a podcast, and really try to cater to that.

257
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:27,940
So we figured everyone would sign up with their desired user name.

258
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,220
And I guess we made some thinking errors in there.

259
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,860
And there were quite a significant number.

260
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,820
And I say no, at least 20 podcasters who registered what they wanted

261
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,540
for their show name.

262
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,700
And of course, if you have, let's say if I registered,

263
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,740
instead of as Adam, I registered his daily source code.

264
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,180
And then I went and created a show

265
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,300
and wanted that to be daily source code.podshow.com.

266
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,180
It wouldn't work because daily source code was already taken.

267
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,980
And that's my main identity.

268
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,580
So the really are, you have your own identity on podshow plus.

269
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,180
So when you sign up, sign up as yourself,

270
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,540
and then you can create shows.

271
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,860
As many shows as you want, as many episodes as large as you want,

272
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,020
you can, the files can be whatever you want, literally,

273
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,820
which of course is the beauty of the podcast, the living network.

274
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,460
But you can't, you know, what you need to be aware of

275
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,380
is that if you sign up with your show name,

276
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,660
the name is then going to be taken.

277
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,500
So that would be the first, and we've got to figure out,

278
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,100
if this is going to be an ongoing problem,

279
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,700
or if this is just a temporary migration issue

280
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,300
is people who already have podcasts

281
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,500
want to get them onto the podshow network

282
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,380
into podshow plus.

283
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,260
So we have migrated a number of people by hand,

284
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,540
because it was still pretty manageable.

285
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,500
I think there's a tool being put into place

286
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,300
for people as that goes onward that you could possibly swap

287
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,180
out your show name for your identity name,

288
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:46,940
or something like that.

289
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,900
So we are working on it.

290
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,460
Obviously, it's not top of the list,

291
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,620
but it's in the top range,

292
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,180
because we do want to help everyone out,

293
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,740
and that's why I said we're doing a lot of these manually, as well.

294
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,180
Now, regarding the feed vacuum,

295
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,100
this is a good question, and I know you're tuning in saying,

296
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,180
where does the talk about poop?

297
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,340
Yeah, don't worry, it's coming.

298
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,540
I just can't get through a couple of these.

299
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,180
I see my kind of question about the feed vacuum,

300
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,580
and then I think I can answer that specifically.

301
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,340
Hey Adam, it's Mike from the Let's Speak Italian podcast.

302
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,940
I just have a quick question for you

303
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,140
about the feed vacuum in podshow plus.

304
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,300
I wonder if you might take a minute

305
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,900
and just explain how the vacuum is supposed to work,

306
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,980
because I've been trying for a couple of days now,

307
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,140
and I can't figure it out.

308
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,860
When I go in and I enter in,

309
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,700
what my new podshow domain name is supposed to be,

310
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,100
it tells me that that name is already taken,

311
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,940
and it won't suck over my RSS feed,

312
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,340
and all my files into podshow plus.

313
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,140
I know that the podshow domain name that I selected

314
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,060
is mine, because I pre-registered

315
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,460
and got a confirmation back,

316
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,620
that that's my new podshow domain name.

317
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,820
So is the podshow domain name,

318
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,620
is that my domain name as a podcaster,

319
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,940
or as a listener, or both, I'm just confused.

320
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,900
I can't understand why it won't let me enter in,

321
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,980
the new Let's Speak Italian podshow domain name

322
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,340
that I've reserved.

323
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,500
I did send your boys an email a couple days ago.

324
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,340
I haven't heard back,

325
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,420
so I was just getting a little impatient.

326
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,940
I'm definitely interested in moving over to podshow,

327
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,340
moving all my stuff over there,

328
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,620
but I just can't seem to figure out that feed vacuum.

329
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,180
Maybe you could address it in the DSE.

330
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,180
Thanks, man.

331
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,020
How do you get it?

332
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,020
Yeah, pronto.

333
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,860
Okay.

334
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,980
Exactly, exactly the problem I just highlighted.

335
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,500
In addition, we've seen some people who use the feed vacuum.

336
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
The feed vacuum is really a migration tool.

337
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,540
So if you want to make use of the podcast delivery network,

338
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,100
which is free and you can read the agreement,

339
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,780
every single time in fact you go to your show,

340
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,980
you'll see a link to the agreement.

341
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,380
So you can be reminded of what it means

342
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,660
and what we can do for you.

343
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,100
You can start a new show by sucking over

344
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,580
your existing podcast feed and the shows.

345
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,580
Now what does happen is people may have a feed

346
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,380
with, let's say, 20 shows listed in it

347
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,900
or sometimes much more than that.

348
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,540
Those actually have to be transferred

349
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,260
from your current host over to our servers.

350
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,900
And that can just take a while.

351
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,860
I mean, you know how long it takes

352
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,060
to download one show.

353
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,860
Even though we have high speed connections,

354
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,100
it kind of depends on the size of the file

355
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,620
and the connection that the host that you are currently using has.

356
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,100
So it can take a little while for all the files to be sucked over.

357
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,620
And of course, the whole thing wasn't working in the beginning

358
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,980
and we apologize for not sucking,

359
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,820
literally not sucking because we sucked

360
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,660
because we didn't suck.

361
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,260
Anyway, that's taking care of.

362
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,900
And I think that people who signed up with a show name

363
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,460
now understand that there is a way to convert that

364
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,140
and we're making it tool available.

365
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,540
Yeah, and I'm Mrs. Chris and Philadelphia.

366
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,980
I have a comment on my own channel.

367
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,660
My console page is eGoAPEX.podshow.com.

368
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,620
I think, let's set up a page there.

369
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,420
I sent up a collection.

370
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,500
And I set up a channel full of all the podcasts I want.

371
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,780
Put them in the iTunes.

372
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,540
And they aren't showing up, you know,

373
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,140
as I'd expect them to.

374
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,140
I'm still subscribed through all the normal feeds.

375
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,580
And so I see the dawn and do show up in, you know,

376
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,980
it's own feed and not in the podcast channel.

377
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,300
I'm going to have to take a look at it all.

378
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,580
Well, basically, what I want to do in the future

379
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:22,580
is have this one feed for my channel sent to quick news,

380
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,660
which is a program that once runs on my palm,

381
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,340
which is Wi-Fi.

382
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,900
And amazingly, in my single studio has Wi-Fi now.

383
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,100
So basically, when a new podcast arrives, quick news will check

384
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,620
down at it, boom, there it is.

385
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,180
I can listen to on my palm.

386
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,900
That's an ideal world.

387
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,060
Hopefully, you can get there eventually.

388
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,980
OK, let me just interrupt here for one second.

389
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,700
OK, that's exactly the way we designed it.

390
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,900
And we've had some issues with the channels.

391
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,100
I think, particularly what is happening is you're putting a show

392
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,220
into a channel.

393
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,340
And then for some unknown reason, some shows disappear from the channel.

394
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,100
And that is a bug.

395
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,180
And we're trying to fix that.

396
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,900
Believe me, I'm all over it because I've been using pod show

397
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,700
plus and the whole channel metaphor for months now,

398
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,580
while I was in beta.

399
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,140
I've not used iTunes for months, literally,

400
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,700
other than sync up to my iPod.

401
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,820
This is exactly what we wanted to make.

402
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,300
So you actually couldn't make your portable.

403
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:24,580
When I was at your, I forget the name of the aggregator you

404
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,780
were talking about as a pod catcher.

405
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,780
So you could use that or you could use juice,

406
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,820
or you could use your mobile phone.

407
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,340
And the new Nokia has a podcast download

408
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,900
the function built right into it that was the N91

409
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:42,460
since sale, payment you bastards.

410
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,820
So the idea was, and you'll see,

411
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,620
and actually, I should lead by example,

412
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,660
and I'll do this later on today.

413
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:52,500
Most people have like music shows, talk shows, comedy shows,

414
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,300
those are kind of like their channels.

415
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,820
But the intent, and I should do this myself

416
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,060
and actually perfect for the upcoming trip,

417
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,180
is you could have a channel for your iPod,

418
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,860
a channel for your trio or trio,

419
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,380
a channel for at work, a channel for at home.

420
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,820
And all of these channels have different ways

421
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,940
to download them.

422
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,540
And so if you're in your channel view,

423
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,140
and you click on a show or you expand the channel,

424
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,220
you'll see that the four download options,

425
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,540
which includes iTunes, just click on the iTunes button

426
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,940
and it's automatically going to subscribe

427
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,500
that channel into your iTunes.

428
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,100
So everything that comes into that channel,

429
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,940
and I think we've limited it currently

430
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,900
to three episodes per show,

431
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,140
will then flow automatically into the channel,

432
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,380
the way you named it right onto your iPod,

433
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,380
if you hook it up.

434
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,780
And of course, you could do the same for any other device

435
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,260
that understands RSS, which is kind of the beauty of it.

436
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,620
And so Tiva will be able to do that,

437
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,820
and your skybox in the UK, and maybe some other offerings

438
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,620
that include stuff you hook up to your television.

439
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,140
So that is indeed exactly the way we designed it.

440
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,780
So go into the download function.

441
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,900
You can see that you can get even the RSS XML,

442
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,820
if you want from the channel,

443
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,460
or as I said, you couldn't select iTunes

444
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,620
and just select it in boom it automatically,

445
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,220
open up iTunes and subscribe your entire channel in there.

446
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,940
So if you want to add another show to whatever it is

447
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,380
for whatever reason, so let's say I have my walking the dog channel,

448
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,580
yeah right, I could add another show to that,

449
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,860
and when a new episode is available,

450
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,020
it'll automatically show up.

451
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,460
And of course, because I've subscribed to that in iTunes,

452
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,500
I'll be able to listen to it while I'm walking the dog,

453
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,660
which is, let's just do it,

454
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,180
but example, because I just don't walk the dog.

455
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,180
See what else you got here about here.

456
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,860
I'm already going to skip the whole RSS process

457
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,460
and be able to download it straight through.

458
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,460
So that's, yeah, but the one thing is,

459
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,180
pod shows, website doesn't look very nice

460
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,580
on my palm web browser, it's called the laser,

461
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,260
and there's not much else out there for palm otherwise.

462
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:02,260
So maybe some, what is it, PHP, magic, that'll make.

463
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,500
Magic, that'll make.

464
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,700
Yeah, okay, I got it.

465
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,300
Yeah, well, so that's, I think we should make some of the channel,

466
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,940
functionality available for mobile,

467
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:17,940
so you can shuffle stuff around, but until these browsers

468
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,060
get much better, and the speed gets much better,

469
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,220
and they certainly don't understand how to interpret the Ajax

470
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,940
we use on the page.

471
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,940
Really, you control everything from the web browser,

472
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,780
and when you're mobile, you should just be able to get the shows

473
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,180
you want, because you're subscribed to them

474
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,060
in your mobile channel.

475
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,700
Hey, if you're listening to us on Stars 102 on Serious

476
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,700
Satellite Radio, go to podshow.com, check it out.

477
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,740
I think it'll be amazed that what else can be done

478
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,140
with these things called podcast,

479
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,540
besides just putting them back to back on Serious 102,

480
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,140
which we do every day, and PCH is next.

481
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:52,660
Okay, I've one more thing about podshow plus,

482
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,020
but first of promo for a new show,

483
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,300
a guy who, unfortunately, we've only been able to work

484
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,780
with him on Serious Satellite Radio,

485
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,500
because the Frank Truth podcast,

486
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,420
which has been around for a long time,

487
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:10,220
I love to bits, Brian knows does this show,

488
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,300
and of course, it's not pod safe,

489
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:16,020
but now he's got his podshow plus account up and running.

490
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,660
I don't know if he's using cast blaster or not,

491
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,580
but he's got a new show, and it is, well,

492
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,620
it's definitely different from the Frank Truth,

493
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,700
and honestly, I got it.

494
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,140
Hey, forget the nose, spin zone,

495
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,140
welcome to the nose zone, great music,

496
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,780
no bull, nose zone.podshow.com.

497
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,060
Hey, Adam, I'm Fuggler J,

498
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,300
what's all from the big ugly podcast,

499
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,660
the and I am a folder, and for fuck's sake,

500
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,300
we're not gonna get into the details.

501
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,660
How do you get people to talk about this stuff?

502
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,700
I promise you, we're gonna talk about some other shit.

503
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,020
That's coming up, stay tuned, you put mysters.

504
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,340
Anyways, I just wanted to say that looking forward

505
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,460
to checking out podshow plus and hopefully migrating

506
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,460
my show over to podshow servers here in the near future,

507
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,620
just a couple of questions concerning that.

508
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,860
First of all, I'm wondering how the free hosting

509
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:16,260
is going to be affecting podshow handing out contracts

510
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,580
what the new plan is on that front.

511
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,460
Hey, good question, I like it.

512
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,660
Well, we're gonna have all kinds of promotions

513
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,940
and things that people on the podshow plus

514
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,780
can participate in.

515
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,100
If you create a show, if you've migrated your show

516
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,420
over to the podcast, the literary network,

517
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,260
we're gonna be reaching out to you.

518
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,740
You better believe it, we're going to have,

519
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,460
as I said, registered listener drives,

520
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,140
so you'll actually be compensated

521
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,180
for each registered listener you bring into your show.

522
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,420
And I do kind of like that, by the way,

523
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,900
you can see who's listening to the show.

524
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,140
Of course, it doesn't represent the entire audience,

525
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,700
certainly not for existing shows,

526
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,380
but for people who are listening to the show via podshow plus,

527
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,140
it's right there, you can see their faces

528
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,380
and click on them and talk to them

529
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,140
and they can interact back.

530
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,780
And also, we're always looking around the network

531
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,660
for what's going on.

532
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:08,980
So that's literally how we're going to bring people

533
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,820
into the family.

534
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,300
The podcasters who on the podcast,

535
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,660
literary network now participate in a number of different

536
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,060
promotions and ways to make money

537
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:20,380
and to promote products and ideas and services,

538
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,700
and including our own network and shows on the network.

539
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,300
There's a whole bunch of incentive programs

540
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,140
that we have running and now we have the site running.

541
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,620
Now we're going to roll out all the stuff.

542
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,620
We've been having in our heads for years now.

543
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,940
We can really blow this out and make this huge.

544
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,340
So that's how that's going to work.

545
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,140
This is kind of just, we don't see a huge amount of money

546
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,900
in add-insertions.

547
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,340
It's low-hanging fruit, literally,

548
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,420
and the volume of podcasts being consumed

549
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:58,420
does really does not constitute the scale necessary

550
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,660
for an add-sense type model where you're inserting Google

551
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,620
add-sense into webpages based upon the context

552
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,460
of the webpages.

553
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,340
The volume is just not there and the click-throughs

554
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,780
are very different concept when it comes to how someone

555
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,940
interacts with entertainment they take on the go.

556
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,460
So there's a whole bunch of things there

557
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,740
that just really aren't that interesting.

558
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:25,100
What works for us is to market the relationship

559
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,980
that a producer of a podcast has with their audience.

560
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,500
That is very powerful.

561
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,460
Advertises are understanding how much value is in there

562
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,820
because advertisers are smart.

563
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,660
And they're seeing all the opportunity.

564
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:41,660
And so we're not just reinventing broadcasting, if you will,

565
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,260
but what is advertising?

566
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,220
How does that work?

567
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,300
How do you get your message across?

568
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,860
No crap, I should probably do the earthling here thing right now.

569
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,620
Since I'm on it, let me do that.

570
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,380
Here's another one of the finalists for our contest

571
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:01,380
to the challengerather at challenge.podshow.com.

572
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,900
Did I even load this thing up?

573
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,900
The hell am I doing?

574
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,500
I'll play it from here, hold on a second.

575
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,500
Let me fire this up.

576
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:15,740
Big, you made it possible for my ex-wife to find me.

577
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:21,740
She has my core, she has my dog, she has my kids,

578
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:28,060
she has my freaking frog and me.

579
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:34,740
You made it possible for my ex-wife to find me.

580
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:39,780
Reliable, high speed and introduction, or stable than your marriage.

581
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:44,180
So just one of the many ways people have been able to participate in changing advertising

582
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:48,900
and making some money on the side, if not full time, as well.

583
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,700
And we have a number of those examples.

584
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,260
So we're really trying to build an industry here.

585
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,660
And I think we're getting somewhere.

586
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,260
Really do.

587
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,940
Okay, let's continue with your comment.

588
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:05,060
And also, it's probably a couple of weeks in the future before anybody

589
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,780
have a chance to check this out.

590
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:11,780
But apparently there's a new program called Cross Over Market.

591
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:19,060
It's similar to one for Linux Elijah Run Windows applications on Mac OS 10

592
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,740
running Windows.

593
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:25,300
And I'm wondering if any of your listeners are planning on using

594
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,940
that so they can on cast blaster on their Macintosh machine.

595
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,980
Anyways, thanks a lot for the show.

596
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,940
Oh, and also, and thank you for playing sunny comes on Fridays.

597
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,060
Charlie, I played them a couple of weeks ago, and he's really good stuff.

598
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,420
Yeah, it's good stuff.

599
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,020
My great.

600
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,940
Yeah, I know a number of people who are running cast blaster and some kind of Windows

601
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,420
emulation on a MacBook Pro.

602
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,340
You know, all this stuff is going to melt together.

603
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,100
It'll, everything will all run everywhere.

604
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:58,100
I'm so glad we didn't put the investment into a Mac version, particularly seeing how

605
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,900
this is all working.

606
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:04,340
We should probably help the emulator guys out of anything, or the window and window or

607
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:09,300
wine people or whatever, you know, parallel, boot, and all that stuff.

608
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:15,460
Whatever it is, right now I'm just really still happy on my Sony Vio laptop.

609
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,820
For it, you know, now that I've gotten used to all the key commands, I've got

610
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,500
a little control H to hide stuff.

611
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,220
Excuse me.

612
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,660
That wasn't worthy of us in sale.

613
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,620
Painty cox occurs.

614
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:34,500
Patricia and I were talking about a language bug on the home page on Friday.

615
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,460
Miss miss spelling of it.

616
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,220
Let me just see this comes from Peter Jarros.

617
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,220
Hey there, this song could help you remember the difference between it's and it's

618
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,940
with an apostrophe credits are available in the ID three tags.

619
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,540
Oh, let me just mouse over there.

620
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,260
What is the credits?

621
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,980
Hey, credits don't say anything.

622
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,180
That's interesting.

623
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,900
His show was Jesus on the radio.

624
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,180
Jesus on the radio.com.

625
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,940
And of course, once you hear the song, then you immediately know how to remember.

626
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,060
Oh, if you wanted to be possessive, it's just IT.

627
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,500
Yeah, it's part of it, it's supposed to be a contraction and it's IT.

628
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,940
Possibly, it's got to go ahead, it's got to go ahead.

629
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,660
Got it, won't forget it ever again.

630
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,860
Hey, I have a story writer.

631
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,900
Just had a question about the player in Pod Show Plus.

632
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,340
I'm on a Windows machine.

633
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,420
Uh, first thing I couldn't get it to work or actually it was working on one computer

634
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:31,060
not the other and I turned out that I had to update my flash player on the one computer

635
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,340
and all seemed well.

636
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:37,460
But now I'm running into another issue where again, just one of the computers,

637
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:43,540
if you hide the pop-up window that the player is on, it actually stops playing.

638
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:49,860
So basically, you can't do anything when you're actually listening to the podcast, which is kind of annoying.

639
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:54,020
But again, it's only on one computer and they're both running Windows XP home.

640
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,020
And I believe they both have the same flash version.

641
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:00,020
So I was wondering if this is something that you've encountered or if anybody else is encountered

642
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,380
and what the fix is for that.

643
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,020
Thanks a lot and we'll talk to you later.

644
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,380
So this is something I've seen too and I consider this to be a serious bug.

645
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:11,940
I don't know what's going on with this and it happens intermittently on my machine.

646
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,900
I have, as far as I know, I haven't changed or upgraded my flash.

647
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,620
You know, Windows from time to time will just reboot your computer and say,

648
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:22,900
thanks for updating, which I thought I had turned off, but it maybe was a critical update.

649
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:28,180
But I even see it sometimes and this has been going on pre-pot show plus launch with the

650
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:34,740
pod save music network where if you actually cover one window with a flash player running with another window,

651
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,660
it'll cut out and if you just move the window over so that piece of flash is exposed,

652
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,780
then it starts playing again.

653
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:46,740
Even if you scroll it down or up off the view of the actual page outside of the pain view that you're

654
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,220
looking at, it'll also stop and this doesn't happen all the time but I do see it and I have to

655
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:55,860
agree it's 100 million thousand percent annoying and I don't know if it's something that we did

656
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:00,180
or if it's something with flash does or maybe it's something the way Firefox handles

657
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:07,780
plugins, if you know, please let me know because I'd love to stop that too, that's, and again,

658
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,620
it's intermittent, it doesn't happen all the time so it's completely annoying.

659
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:19,700
What were those, or those voice mail numbers again? I can't remember what was that.

660
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:27,540
The number you're looking for is 206, 65, 65, 65, 65, 7, but I'd rub that in a little bit.

661
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:38,180
Hey, you're asking for comments on DSC420 about the new patch of site and look at it,

662
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:46,420
play it around with it. I got in and I have my profile and one problem I'm having is some of the

663
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:52,500
pictures I have downloaded that we're downloaded as day pegs don't seem to be showing up. Don't know

664
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:59,380
what that's problem on my end or your end anything you can suggest there. The other thing was,

665
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:08,740
as I was trying to put my feed from my service into yours using your feed vacuum,

666
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:15,940
family instructions are a little confusing. I'm a complete rookie at this podcast thing so

667
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:22,580
coding and stuff like that. I have no idea and I very well may have any missing something really

668
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:30,820
really simple but I don't know maybe if there could be, I don't know, like a tutorial or a frequently

669
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:38,900
ask questions or something for those, you know, computer, some literate people like myself and

670
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:45,780
rookie podcasters, anyways, but have a good one and eight people. Yeah, you know, writing

671
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:51,780
help and frequently ask questions and stuff like that is hard stuff, man. That's not trivial.

672
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:56,900
So we clearly didn't do a good job for you. I think you may be missing there's a if you

673
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:03,380
there's a little arrow you can click and it'll expand help almost for every single podcaster option,

674
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:08,260
but it should be pretty self explanatory. If you're still having problems, we actually have

675
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,980
links at the bottom of every single page. One is listener support. So if you have a problem,

676
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:18,180
you can open up and it goes straight through to our, was it live person, mantis, whatever,

677
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:24,180
back end. So it always gets registered to take it as issued. I believe you should receive an email

678
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:29,300
after you've entered that that, you know, it's been acknowledged and a ticket has been created.

679
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:36,340
So you can track it and use that in future reference. And of course, there's also a podcaster

680
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,420
support link. And I think they have a lot of standard answers and they're starting to create the

681
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:46,420
FAQs, which you really can only create once you've had some FAQs. You know, yeah, we had a lot of

682
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:55,300
beta tester FAQs, but you guys are really doing that FAQs. So voice mail numbers 2016256357

683
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:00,340
and New Jersey put a plus one in front of it. If you're at your cell phone right now and you want to

684
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:05,780
enter in our UK number, it's plus four, four, two, zero, seven, six, eight, one, three, seven, five,

685
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:11,780
three. And now ladies and gentlemen, it is unbelievable. The amount of comments I have received

686
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:21,300
regarding scruncher versus folder of toilet tissue. I am, I'm amazed and yet at the same time

687
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:27,300
to smade about about the audience. What is it? Why do we want to talk about this? It's because

688
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:35,780
something that is never talked about that is always kept private. And I never stopped to think about

689
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:40,580
the difference between folders and scrunchers being a folder myself and user of other types of

690
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:46,580
accessories. And now it's just gotten to the point where I have so many different pieces of feedback

691
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:52,980
and so much audio. I'm just going to play the most recent ones for you back to back. So you could

692
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:58,020
shuttle ahead five minutes if poop grosses you out. But it's quite amazing the things that people

693
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:05,060
have to say about this. And it also concludes the discussion. Okay? Hello Adam, the manly geek here,

694
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:10,420
just calling him response to your data call about scrunchers versus folders. Well of course,

695
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:16,020
I'm a folder since I'm also a great fan of origami. And yes, you guessed it. What I import and

696
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:22,580
on the pod, sometimes I take my toilet paper and I create origami shapes from it. The favorite

697
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:31,060
things that I like to use to wipe my ass is origami cranes, frogs, and paper mache heads of Hillary

698
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:37,540
Clinton and Larry King. I love to have them kiss my ass. Anyhow, just thought I'd let you know,

699
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:42,900
probably more information than you wanted to talk about. Adam, this is Robert and Toronto from the

700
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:48,340
Whiteroom for Radio podcast. There's folder and scruncher thing on the little confused. For sure

701
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,180
in my house, and there's always two or three women because I'm, you know, one of these lucky guys,

702
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:56,500
although I always sleep with one the other two or the younger generation. But they're women

703
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,940
nonetheless. Now they always scrunch for the front. And I can see that. But I think they probably

704
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:06,980
fold for the back. I'm a folder for the back. I don't say you can scrunch into the back properly.

705
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:12,740
There's a real interesting piece on the back part and Howard Stern's private parts.

706
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:17,780
So you talk about the appropriate and proper way to wipe yourself. But I sound like he was

707
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:23,380
a fold. But I think women generally, you've got to define this now. Are they scrunching and

708
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:29,380
folding or scrunching only or folding only? Anyway, Robert Toronto, Ruth Radio, podcast, let's see

709
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:35,860
on this episode. Hey, Dan. Hey, dude. Adam, this is Dan from Wichita, Kansas. The birthplace

710
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:41,940
of the Delta Cia. We just wanted to let you know that in Kansas, we're not scrunchers or folders.

711
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:47,780
We still use corn cobs. Thanks. Hi, Adam Curry. This is Eric West with the Beats efforts

712
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:56,340
to skill at www.sf.com. Just find a way in on the rescue room situation. I would have to say

713
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:05,300
paper comes off the top, scrunched and always put the lid down. Thanks. Talk to you later.

714
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:09,700
Have a great week. Hey, Adam, do these just a few more calls from the Netherlands.

715
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:21,060
I just have a small remark on the scruncher folder issue. Like beside the fact that I'm a scruncher

716
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:31,220
myself, I always like to finish it off with at least something went. That's because I've been

717
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:38,260
tripping a lot in India. And one time I heard a guy, an Indian guy telling someone who was

718
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:44,180
sitting a tourist sitting beside him in the train and was complaining about not toilet paper

719
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:52,260
being there. He said, well, sir, we always do it. They wipe the Indian. You know, they wipe their

720
00:40:52,260 --> 00:41:00,020
their asses with water and just their bare hands. And the tourist found it in disgusting idea.

721
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:04,820
We're on the Indian guy set. Well, sir, what would you do if you would have some

722
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:10,500
sheet in your face? Would you only wipe it with just a piece of paper? Thanks. Keep it up.

723
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,740
Hi, I'm Ms. Curry. It should be from San Jose, California. You can find my podcast at

724
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:20,660
theshubishow.com. Sorry for that shameless plug. Anyways, so I previously called in about

725
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:27,860
being a scruncher. And that was like scruncher pride. But I was in the bathroom yesterday. And I'm

726
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:34,180
like, you know what? Let's try out this folding thing. Let's just try something new. And it sure

727
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:43,220
takes a hundred thousand times longer than scrunching. But my God, it feels so much better than

728
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:50,740
scrunching. And a lot less toilet paper used, too. So 12 scrunchers out there in the world. Try

729
00:41:50,740 --> 00:42:00,580
folding. It's great. Yo, Adam, Trucker Tom here. Scruncher versus folder. I'd say I'm definitely

730
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:09,380
a scruncher. I don't know if you've ever had to use too many truck stop restroom facilities.

731
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:17,220
Kind of pisses me off. A lot of them are using these giant rolls of really cheap toilet paper.

732
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:24,420
And you go to pull on it. And a lot of times it just break a term cup at off. And so you got to

733
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:31,220
carefully roll that stuff out and kind of get a big wide of it. And, you know, because otherwise,

734
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:36,580
if you don't have a big wide of it, something's going to slip through. Probably we don't want to go

735
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:45,460
there. I do love another question regarding people using public restroom facilities. How many of

736
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:53,300
you people out there? And how many of you some states require the, you know, you have the

737
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:59,540
little thing that you line the seat with. They've got it up on the wall. You just just got the

738
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:06,340
little dispenser and you just pull a thing down and you put that down on the toilet seat.

739
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:14,100
But a lot of states, the majority of states don't require those. And so how many people

740
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:21,540
line the toilet seat with toilet paper? How common is that? I personally think it's pretty common.

741
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:27,060
I do that myself because I don't want to just sit on public toilet. And, of course, that's, you

742
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:32,580
know, since I'm out here on the road all the time, that's really my only choice. So how many people

743
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:42,020
are lining the public toilet seats with the toilet paper? You can catch me at

744
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:50,980
truckartom.podshow.com and now also truckartompodcast.com. Catch you later.

745
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:57,940
Hello Adam and Patricia. This is Jared Nadeog from St. Louis, Missouri. I do not have a podcast,

746
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:03,620
but I simply love listening to the Charlie. Your podcast, as well as several others,

747
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:10,420
helped me make it through my 12-hour shift at work. I was just listening to DSC 421 and I wanted to say

748
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:16,020
that I am a folder. I wanted to leave a comment about the toilet seat, whether or not the toilet

749
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:23,060
seat should be up or down. I grew up where the toilet seat as well as the lid is always kept down

750
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:27,060
when not used. I just can't stand walking into a bathroom and seeing the lid up.

751
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,540
So anyway, keep up the good work on such a great show. Take care.

752
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:41,620
Hi Adam and hello Patricia. My name is Dana aka Wanker Girl and I'm sending out a big

753
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:47,300
hello from Newfoundland Canada. This is my first time sending you a comment. So please be kind to

754
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:54,740
me. Anyway, in show 421, Patricia said that talking about poo was a guy thing and I just wanted

755
00:44:54,740 --> 00:45:01,940
to say that I completely disagree. My absolute favorite topic of conversation is poop.

756
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:08,260
I'd last tell my check. Yeah, I'm a girl. Any conversation about poo is fantastic because it

757
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:14,900
always gets people laughing. There is nothing funnier than exchanging stories about really stinky

758
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:22,740
poo's or massive sized poo's. Weirdly colored poo's or my favorite accidentally pooping in your

759
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:30,980
pants. So there you have it. Girls like poop too. Anyway, I'll shut up now, but first I got to insert my

760
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:39,220
shameless plug. I have a listen to me at my podcast Blurm at Blurmcast.com. Oh and by the way Adam,

761
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:48,020
I'm a scruncher. Scruncher. There you go. The topic of poop is now officially closed,

762
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:54,180
the scruncher or folder conversation. Do you because I just like to move on to something else?

763
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:59,860
Please, and what's so funny, you can see how it goes in waves. It takes about three or four days.

764
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:05,540
I can really even a week sometimes after I do a show before the comments really come rolling in.

765
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:09,940
I still got to get used to that because a lot of it is immediate because people are listening

766
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:14,100
immediately and then a lot of people catch up later on weekends or just or behind or listen

767
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:18,260
on different schedule, which is fine, of course. But then all the comments come much later.

768
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:24,100
It becomes an administrative nightmare. I'm telling you. But thank you very much.

769
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:30,500
It was such wonderful insight. It really is. It's so good to know my audience. I love you.

770
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,180
Every single one of you poopers.

771
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,220
Yo, let's up Adam. This jersey tied the official musical just of the Cha Cha.

772
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,700
And every once in a while I went a big case and I sent the client off the Jake the jeweler in the

773
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:46,580
city or go tell him to hang out at Tiffany's. And I was thinking, hey, as a podcaster, what can

774
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:52,260
I do to add a little blink to my podcast the jersey taught show? Well that's easy. Jeff Smith,

775
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,260
check this out.

776
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,340
What do you say?

777
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:35,060
You might even live in this case, jersey side. Yeah, yeah. It was jersey side.

778
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:41,940
Oh, jersey side. Show up now. It's jersey side.

779
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,380
Oh, yeah. I know it's just a touch.

780
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:51,700
So it's pretty obvious what my pick of the week is going to be. It's Jeff Smith.

781
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:55,460
And I know you've heard a lot of Jeff Smith on the Pontiff music network, but I don't know if

782
00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:00,020
you've heard this song. This song just came up about a week or so ago. And it's amazing. It's

783
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:05,460
called Save Me. And it's typical Jeff Smith. It sticks in your head and makes you feel good. So

784
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:10,260
from the Pontiff music network, this is Save Me. Oh, and check out the fun little ending. You're going to love it.

785
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:34,980
Yeah. I know it's not right. I can't keep this up every night. I know. I'm wrong.

786
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:48,420
I admit it. It's so go and knock my ego down. Save me from myself. I could be somebody else.

787
00:48:48,420 --> 00:49:00,580
Maybe just like you now too. If I could just calm down and be more sweet. Do I talk too much

788
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:11,460
of down myself? Oh, yeah. Enough about you. Just let me steal the spotlight now. Oh, no.

789
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:22,740
Save me from myself. I shouldn't be somebody else. Maybe just like you now too.

790
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:35,540
If I could just calm down and be myself. It's that all right. I'm only begging you to help me out.

791
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:38,420
Yeah.

792
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:51,220
Yeah.

793
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:32,140
I don't spend the best I can to be a more considerate selfless man oh yeah

794
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:39,140
I've heard it before, but I'm trying harder than ever before

795
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:51,140
Draw me, save me from myself I could be somebody else maybe just like you

796
00:50:51,140 --> 00:51:01,140
If I could just come down and beat, save me from myself

797
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:13,140
I should be somebody else just like you, if I could just come down to me

798
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:23,140
Somebody else's name, somebody else's name, I need somebody else's name

799
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:32,140
I use somebody else's name, I need somebody else's name, I need somebody else's name

800
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:36,140
Oh man, just myth kicks ass

801
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:39,140
G-E-O-F-A. Thegefsmith.com

802
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,140
Jersey Tots. You want it up for me, man?

803
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,140
I can lawyer when you want him, you can never get him, you know?

804
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,140
Start the Jersey Tots.

805
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:06,140
We're just as late as we are.

Chef Smith on the POD save music network.

807
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:15,140
I love that song. I hope you get the play on the daily source code.

808
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:19,140
Hey, how have a good week everybody. This has been Jersey Tots and I'll catch you on the flip side.

809
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:24,140
Thank you very much, Jersey Tots. I did that yesterday. Well, flying because I was going over big and hill so often.

810
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,140
I've crossed it four times in one day.

811
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:31,140
And and there was a very nice female voice

812
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:36,660
on the at the control tower and so on my third trip going to pick Patricia up I said I'll catch on the flip side

813
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,660
I came back with like

Everybody thanks for listening to this long show full of pod show plus another ship

818
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:54,260
Literally and tomorrow I'll be traveling

819
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:58,900
Off to San Francisco so there will be no show Wednesday morning. I'll be back with you
