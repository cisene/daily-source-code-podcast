Delta Sierra Charlie 362, the hip hop edition.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hmm.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I like my Charlie's served up.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
GoDaddy?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Don't come.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Sixty million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I guess it's Adam Curry.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But I got 700 messages for you from friends who tried to kill you.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Interstended aircraft, back to them.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
All the rest that we can't so some kind of the scam that prevails in my head.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The form of spares.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And I'm the one she's so lucky that she's got $20 million that she has to protect.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
She can't wait.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And we're in a cruciated time to answer.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And all she needs is my hang.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Number through the transfers shirt.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh yeah, that sounds total to the gym.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And hit my ATM cardication idiot.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can't believe that people offer this shit.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It really sucks to last year.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This little correct made a hundred million bucks.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Look, I'm on the free vacation.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
To the white hole in you.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's my credit card number to verify.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Well, I was just quite fed it for you right now.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But right after hell, he decided this time we'll allow.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
True interest rates are red and all time low.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm no financial genius for one thing.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I know I'm better off getting money from my zero mom.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Then from sketchy chick.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Ty just give me his VAM,

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
so you can see.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What the reason, I'm just sore.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Some my eyes grow in vices.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Or these people think that he's so much my nag.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,600
The heroine is in larger, something to come

42
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,400
With a battery charger, here's a two-for-one offer

43
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,400
I don't know about you, but what the hell am I supposed to do with you?

44
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,800
Here's another chick who wants to meet me online

45
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,400
For a one-on-chat, just twelve ninety-nine

46
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,600
She included a butcher, as her name is Barney before that price

47
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
We could chat with her written a red army

48
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,200
Like a boy from home, I can get rich quit

49
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,800
I can buy stupid herbs like that, I'll never get sick

50
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,800
And if I get quick, I'll get a paper or something that'll show me how to buy men

51
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,200
So can't I doubt for nothing?

52
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,800
It's amazing that these folks are so concerned about my health considering when I had a flat

53
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,400
I don't want stop to help you, but I can think for myself

54
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,600
And I'm not falling for squad, whether they can get me 3k, 4 or not

55
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:25,600

57
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:04,240
The following is a true story. Only the bandwidth has been changed to protect my quota.

58
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,360
That was good on earth, so why I'm going to keep it see if I can make it work?

59
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,640
I want to travel to the future and visit Captain Kirk, so until he gets some money that I know I can trust,

60
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,440
he can rot in 2000, whatever, like the rest of the bus.

61
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:55,520
Okay, let's see. I've got a message from my mother, my cousin, Dave and Spam.

62
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,420
Spam, my sister, Tracy, and Spam? Spam Spam, his spanПam looks cute, so it's litter and Spam?

63
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:08,480
Spam Spam Spam, Spam Spam Spam, Oh look, somebody bought an album.

64
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,400
Spam Spam Spam, Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam, Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Swamp Spam Spam.

65
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,920
-"Spend Теперь upfront, spent spent spent spends spent spend spends spends spent spent spent spoil

66
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,660
smell.

67
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,680
skateboardable smell!"

68
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,460
Spout time somewhat upgraded at Hunts, sudden death from the Podsafe music network,

69
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:29,020
and spam they are from New Jersey, New United States, you can find it in music.vodshow.com.

70
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,060
More hip hop on the way.

71
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,360
I'm of a different variety which, you'll just have to stay tuned for, it is Wednesday,

72
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,400
everybody.

73
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
It's a special day.

74
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,660
Today, we're going to be testing our golden ticket enterprise contest

75
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,140
challenge systemology architecture or something like that. So that means that

76
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:53,140
you might not even be hearing the show. Stuff might have already broken. Who knows this so many

77
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,580
different things that could go wrong with this home in a second. I'm still adjusting all

78
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,700
the knobs here, getting everything all straightened up. I'm going to try and keep it

79
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,460
relatively short today because all kinds of stuff going on here at the cottage. Remember

80
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,860
we're leaving on Friday for vacation going to Portugal and just getting there is

81
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,340
being turning out to be quite a trip by itself. You know, we were able to get

82
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,820
lodging. We were able to get some flights, but the flights don't actually originate

83
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:23,420
from Gatwick. So I'm trying to arrange a aircraft that will support the three of us

84
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,620
and our two large banks. I don't know if that's going to work. We might turn out

85
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:33,940
just driving to the nearest airport. So as I said, lots of stuff to plan and

86
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:39,380
and to get prepared for and that's all home. And it's just much to do. It's

87
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,220
going to be very hard for me to switch off. Let me tell you 10 days. It's going to be

88
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,300
beautiful though in the in the Algarve in Portugal. I haven't checked the weather

89
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,020
report, but hopefully it's a little better than here in the UK. Although it's not

90
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,100
cold. It's like 12 13 degrees. So it's nice. It's kind of grayish outside. No blue

91
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,700
skies. No no son. No win for that matter either. But we've got a full Charlie lined

92
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,940
up for you with some interesting things. And although I don't have a

93
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,780
metro sexual moment keyed up for you because I'm not going to be able to do it today,

94
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,420
I did not want to withhold this wonderful piece of feedback for you or from you. Hi,

95
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:18,820
this is Carrie Anne from the class on laptop.com. And this is airdry. Airdry has a problem.

96
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,940
I have a problem with Adam Curry. You seem to think about him a lot, airdry. I think about

97
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,620
him a lot. And Adam, it hasn't gotten any better this week when you started talking about

98
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:37,460
your never regions. You need to stop talking about those. It's driving me crazy like I can't

99
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,980
sleep. Yeah. It's interfering with the work. It's interfering with everything, really.

100
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:51,220
Thank you, Adam. Lip gloss. Lip gloss and laptop.com. There you go. It's a pretty good show.

101
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,820
I've been trying to get them signed to the Pod Show podcast network. I don't know if

102
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,900
we's connected yet or where we are in the process because Richard Bruer Hay takes care of all that.

103
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,780
That's the lime. The limey fellow you might speak to on the phone.

104
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:11,380
And yesterday, it started probably around 11 o'clock. I started getting messages and comments on

105
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,500
Curry.com and all kinds of trackbacks and pingbacks and flatbacks and Apple Jax.

106
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,940
About this show called Keith and the Girl. Keith and the Girl are a podcast that

107
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,220
definitely have had my eye on for a while. They've been podcasting for quite a while now. I think

108
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:32,820
they're close to, well, no, I know exactly. They have 247 or I guess today 2408 episodes.

109
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,540
Never really been able to enter into a dialogue with them. Although we just kind of started an email

110
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:43,860
conversation. I only have one email address forum and only got one reply and just in the past

111
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,500
a week or so, actually. Now, before we could continue that dialogue at all,

112
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:56,180
someone apparently sent them a Pod Show contract. Now, this can only be from a handful of people.

113
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,820
So, it's not that hard to trace back. But apparently someone who decided not to sign with Pod

114
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,500
sent a contract that was meant for them to Keith and the Girl. And Keith and the Girl

115
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,780
did something really amazing. They read entire portions of the contract, including all the

116
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,980
legalese on their show and commented on it. And although I was surprised that anyone would do this,

117
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:24,820
I was completely blown away by the entertainment value of this. It's, I wish all my contract

118
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,980
readings were like that where you could have just laughed at it and have fun and joke around.

119
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,940
And you can imagine that there's all kinds of calls now in the Pottersphere and the

120
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:41,780
Bloggersphere and Pod Show. What is your response to this? Well, you can imagine this was

121
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,580
this kind of, you can imagine that this was like, whoa, what's going on here?

122
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:54,500
For two at a sleeve, Michael Butler, the Rock and Roll Geek had his recording gear at Pod Show HQ

123
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:04,820
when the shit hit the fan. And now for another exciting episode of the Pod Show evil contracts.

124
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,660
Boy, I could use a beer, but it's almost midnight and I still have to get 10 more unsuspecting

125
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:17,860
podcasts that's the sign of way their souls before I can go home. Oh, no. Richard,

126
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:24,420
Adam and Ron once you in the chamber. In the chamber? And you better hurry up, I don't think

127
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:32,260
they're in a good mood. Who is it? It's me, boss. Enter. Stay right there. Listen, Bill,

128
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:38,100
get that Pod Show content on the top 10 list or you'll never release a Vista. What is it, Rosie?

129
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:44,100
I have Richard for you. Richard, Ron and I have been reviewing your work and we're wondering if you

130
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:50,340
are really dedicated to Pod Show. Why, boss? Well, your signings are beneath quota this month.

131
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,060
I'm doing everything I can. We sign hundreds of shows. It's not enough.

132
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,980
Adam's right. We need big shows. We need big stars. How about,

133
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,620
how about, what's his name and that chick? Why am I just signed them?

134
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,100
Boss, I think you mean Keith and the girl. We haven't signed them because they hate us. Have you heard

135
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:14,660
their latest show? They spend the entire time crashing us. How could they hate us? We are Pod Show.

136
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,580
Let me hear that show. Here, boss, put on these phones.

137
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,740
Bist weekend.

138
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:32,020
I don't know, man. I think they like us. They think we suck. They say we are evil and they say we're

139
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:37,700
the devil. I don't know. I think this shows funny. Maybe they don't understand us. Anyway,

140
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,100
I like the girl. Adam, maybe we can break them up. How about Adam and the girl?

141
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,660
Think you'll go for it? Yeah, like the sound of that. Adam and the girl.

142
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,340
Sounds good. I don't think that's a good idea. They hate us.

143
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,940
H mate. They just don't understand us. Have we ever spoken with them?

144
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:01,060
No, really. We've tried. Did they know any of us? No, really. They just slam the contract and slam

145
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:06,260
us all the time. So, with no real reason, no real communication. They just make their own opinions

146
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:11,380
and pull them out of their asses. Well, yes. And they build their audience by putting down Pod Show

147
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:16,660
and other podcasts. Yes. We promote them on our site. We promote them in our shows. Yep.

148
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,620
And for this, they stab us in the back. Yes, again. These are my kind of people. Are they

149
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,100
former entertainment industry executives? No, they're comedians. All same difference. What do you think,

150
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,620
Adam? Let me get this straight. They don't know us. They haven't worked with us. We promote them.

151
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,500
They trash us. Then they think other people are dumb enough to work with us if we own everything

152
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,340
and give them nothing. I guess so. Let's get them. If they're making a living by

153
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:43,140
trashing us, the least they can do is come and talk to us. Right, Adam. Rosie. Send a limo.

154
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:48,420
They're in New York. Okay. Send the jet. We don't own a jet. Okay. Call our legal department.

155
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:53,140
We don't have a legal department. No, legal department. Which asshole wrote this contract?

156
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,700
You did bust a little. Oh. Well, what's the problem? They think we sign people up for life.

157
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,780
Own everything and don't make anyone any money. And your point is, they think we're like a

158
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,100
record label. Well, in that case, they're idiots. I want them. Yeah. Let's get a Richard.

159
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,940
What should I do? Bring them to San Francisco. Let's talk to him directly. They'll never come.

160
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:15,700
In that case, maybe they are the devil. Maybe they want to keep podcasting for themselves.

161
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:21,220
Yeah, podcasting for themselves. Maybe they're jealous of Dean and Drew. Don't entrue us.

162
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,420
Dean, Don, whatever. Just get them. Bring us, Keith and the girl. Okay, boss. I'm on it.

163
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,860
Ryan, Mr. Johnson, line one. Tell them to hold. Get Keith and the chicken on the line.

164
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,580
Yeah. And Rosie? Yeah, boss. Rimshot, please.

165
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:42,100
Keith, Camda, your insightful review of our business and console support are truly innovative.

166
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:48,180
Adam myself and our entire family would like to invite you to come out to San Francisco. We'd

167
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:53,460
like to make you an offer. You can't refuse. Richard will be in touch. Great.

168
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,820
Hey, we're a bunch of actors, huh?

169
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:04,660
Thanks to Michael, Rosie, Richard, Ron, the Pacho players.

170
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:10,340
And Marc Yoshimara, an MCoff for the late night work, trying to get that all together the last minute.

171
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:15,140
All right. There you go. The offer does stand, though. And it's for our nickel, no problem.

172
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,500
You're still tuned to the Daily Source code. Greetings, Mr. Curry. To you and to all the

173
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:25,700
residents of the Delta Sierra Charlie Nation. I'm very pleased to inform you that you're site,

174
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:32,100
Curry.com, has been selected to be linked from the big giant button on March 29, 2006.

175
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,300
So you're probably asking, what does this mean? Well, it means that anyone who goes to big

176
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:43,460
giantbutton.com on March 29th and presses the biggest button on the internet will be sent immediately

177
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:49,860
to your site. Why your site? Every day we link the big giant button to something we like.

178
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:56,660
And Adam, we like you. I hope you and some of your listeners will check out big giantbutton.com.

179
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,260
Starting March 27th, we'll be linking to a new site every single day.

180
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:06,580
Visit the big giantbutton. Press it and see what happens. Take care, Adam, and keep up

181
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:11,780
the great work with your podcast and with Pacho. Yeah, so I'm just realizing I'm a total

182
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:16,260
torque. I should have played that one yesterday. Now I'm not getting the benefits of you going to

183
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:24,980
the big giantbutton. I was going to say tap that button for me, baby. Damn. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay,

184
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:31,220
here pop on the way and a couple other interesting promos for you. And something that I promised

185
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,580
you today, a brand new experiment. Hey, Adam, it's Ilya Koja of here. I want to if you're

186
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,380
Russian listeners. I know I'm not a chick, so you won't enjoy my accent that much, but anyway,

187
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:47,220
I just listened to Charlie 361. It took me three times to listen to that. He said,

188
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:54,180
I know I'm not a chick, so you make a lot of listen to me. And two things popped into my mind.

189
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,660
First of all, the golden ticket. Actually, it is possible to find it without listening to every

190
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,620
episode. Basically, it took a pair of the file sizes. Or if you're listening to some of

191
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,940
tech savvy, they can compare the Czech sounds. And unfortunately, and I'm defying Czech

192
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:13,300
some of a DSE with a golden ticket, we'll never be the same as DSE without it. Second is

193
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,340
more like a question about the pot to more besides you mentioned earlier. But the way I have nothing

194
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,980
to do with it, I'm just someone who likes to question things out here. I don't know how it works,

195
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,820
but what if instead of inserting the ad directly into the DSE file, they inserted to the playlist,

196
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:35,940
you see what I mean? Just like we now, or your iTunes party shuffle, they will not modify any

197
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:42,420
of the three, they just play an MP3 ad and then a podcast. Well, it will be legal. For example,

198
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,380
if users hit a play on an empty playlist, it will still play an ad because it's already there,

199
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,740
but fault in the application. Just some food for thoughts. Anyway, great shows and those video

200
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,060
and yeah, yeah, those video and yeah. And I really, I played the whole comment. First, I love

201
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:02,500
it when just listeners check in, you know, that's so cool. We got lots of podcasts with checking

202
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,980
a bit listeners. I really love hearing from listeners who aren't podcasting yet or necessarily.

203
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:13,700
Regarding the pod to mob, so they definitely got the, they got, they got my message at least.

204
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,500
I sent them an email to, they did not respond to that. So not only are they're not running ads

205
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,700
in front of my show, I've been removed from the entire directory and the show doesn't exist.

206
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:28,660
And I think the debate is, it's pretty good. There's an ongoing conversation. You can

207
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:33,380
catch some of that at curie.com and it's a tech and rotty probably is picked up on it by now.

208
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,780
And I think that those guys just made an honest mistake. That's what I truly believe.

209
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,820
Now, back to the golden ticket. So here is the concept. We have this technology we've developed

210
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:48,260
called D-Gap, dynamically generated asset placement. And what this enabled, actually you've probably

211
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:52,740
you've already witnessed it. If you're listening to the show, when I started recording,

212
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,820
all I do is I say, you know, Delta shared Charlie 362 and, you know, and that's enough.

213
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,340
But when you hear the show, you hear things like a 10-second tag, promoting our GoDaddy,

214
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:08,660
one message many voices campaign, which points to this show or whatever show you're listening to.

215
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,940
And it alerts you to the fact that there's something coming up in a code that you want to

216
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:17,620
take advantage of to get some great discounts. And the cool thing about it is we have podcasters

217
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,700
creating their own messaging for their own audiences. Okay, that's another conversation.

218
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,700
But with this technology, we can do a whole bunch of interesting things. So the concept for the golden

219
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:36,420
ticket, I mean, the golden ticket is very simple. For one of the downloads of this Charlie,

220
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:41,700
of this show only, not of the archives, only for this show. And one time only, if all goes

221
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,580
according to plan, I know Andrew Grummit is sitting there with a moist ass, hoping that all goes well

222
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,980
because you're not been working on this. He's in all the programming and all the scheduling and

223
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:55,540
all the stuff and got it all set up and we did a test yesterday and it worked. But this should be

224
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:02,820
one download of this particular daily source code podcast, which will contain a special audio

225
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:10,180
message with a way for the recipient of that to contact me with the special phrase, the phrase

226
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:17,860
that pays everybody. And if they do contact me with the correct phrase, they will win the key

227
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:25,140
span audio video dock for the iPod plus the audio video RF remote courtesy of keyspan and

228
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:31,300
our very own Sam Levin who scammed that for this test. Now, this is not a contest, this is a test,

229
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:36,500
it's beta, it's completely beta. So anything could happen, it could break 8 million people could win.

230
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,820
I've only got one key span dock if it all blows up and we'll just have to call it a wash, okay?

231
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,940
But I think it will actually work. Now, what's going to happen? I just have to pay attention to the

232
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:52,020
time here. Let me see. I've got to jot down this time, hold on a second. So,

233
00:19:53,220 --> 00:20:01,620
19 minutes and 35 seconds into the show. If you heard nothing different than you, you didn't win.

234
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:09,300
One of you's heard a special message, which is inserted in that split second at 19 minutes and 35 seconds.

235
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,900
Those of you listening to us on a serious star's 102, sorry, this doesn't work for you,

236
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,060
but you could still go home, download this podcast from dailysourcecode.com.

237
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,460
Better get subscribed to it. There's all kinds of information about how you can subscribe to podcast

238
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:30,500
and get them automatically. So, you still, yeah, I've once got a chance.

239
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,300
And in fact, what could happen and this would be kind of funky is I could even download my own show

240
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,780
and I could win the prize, which of course would mean that we have to repurpose it. So anyway,

241
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:46,820
hopefully everything will go okay. And as our Russian comrade pointed out there, yes, there are many,

242
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:53,540
we've taken a lot of the spoofing and scamming things into account. But yeah, in general,

243
00:20:53,540 --> 00:21:00,260
there's no real good way to hide the winning ticket. Of course, if it's just an open contest,

244
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,340
if you're a registered listener, well, that would be a whole different story and that would

245
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,980
probably work very, very well. And in the future, we can do this across multiple podcasts.

246
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,900
And I think we can have a lot of fun with it. So tomorrow, hopefully, we'll have a winner

247
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:21,300
and we'll know if our test was successful or not. Oh, hello Adam, it's Cali from Geek Briefman.

248
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:28,340
I want to touch your penis. All right, just kidding, it's magic. I just had to say something to get

249
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:33,620
you to play my goddamn prom, not prom or comment, because you never play my shit anymore Adams

250
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:41,940
Curry and people complain, oh, fuck, never mind. Listen, I heard you're having this golden ticket

251
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:49,380
contest, which I think is a phenomenal idea. So phenomenal, in fact, that I'm having a similar

252
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:55,380
contest on yeast radio. Unfortunately, however, for your audience, it's already finished.

253
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:02,500
But the good news is, Adams Curry, you won. I'm having a very similar contest. It's called the

254
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,540
Golden Shower contest. And you, one, Adams Curry, and I'm going to take a piss on you. I'm

255
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:20,420
going to pee on your face. Do you believe anything is possible? We do. Where are flink?

260
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:51,780
Hi, Adam. This is John from Seattle, Washington, USA. You recently expressed a wish for listeners,

261
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:59,060
not just podcasters to send you audio comments. So, here you go. I'm a relatively new listener,

262
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,340
and I've been hooked since the first show I listened to several weeks ago.

263
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:09,460
Until then, I had heard about podcasts, but like many people, really didn't pay much attention to them.

264
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:17,140
Then a week ago, or so, I got it in my head that an internet radio show would be a fun hobby

265
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:24,500
and began researching. Well, I quickly learned that my basic idea for a show was way out of my

266
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,540
reach due to licensing fees from me as a coasting fees, et cetera, you know, the story.

267
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:36,980
So, when a friend reminded me of podcasts, I started researching and of course, your name came up all

268
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:43,300
over the internet. I remembered your name from my formative years as a teenager watching MTV in the 80s.

269
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:49,300
Yeah, I know, scary, isn't it? And I just had to get an aggregator and check out your show.

270
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:54,260
I was hooked. I'm currently touring with the idea of doing a podcast of my own,

271
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:58,900
but having a difficult time figuring out the things that I'm passionate enough about,

272
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:04,420
to do a show on. So, for now, I am exploring the world of podcasts as a listener

273
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:09,780
and waiting for them used to strike. I figure I should keep this short in case you decide to

274
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:16,100
air this. I love the Charlie, and I look forward to many more. I have some more questions and comments

275
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:23,380
to send you about podcasting and other topics mentioned on the Charlie. But I'll save those for another

276
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:30,580
time. I hope you enjoyed this audio comment. You know, someone should really coin a name for these things,

277
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:39,620
like, podment or audio meant audio comment. It's just mental, blah. Anyway, I look forward to

278
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:44,580
sending you more. Talk for now. And bye everybody on the saddle. Bye.

279
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:50,580
Those of you still with us on the podcast. Thank you very much for hanging out. Just a couple more

280
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,780
things before we get out of here. Probably at the end of each episode, although no one was

281
00:24:53,780 --> 00:25:05,620
really commented on it. You've heard this, uh, this jingle. So, who is the man behind the code?

282
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:11,540
Who is the illustrious cast blaster Mike? Well, it took a priest to figure it out.

283
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:17,700
Cast blaster Mike needed some time alone. He needed focus and concentration for his programming.

284
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,980
So he rented a cottage in the middle of the woods. When I, uh, has this called things to program,

285
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:30,020
I usually retire to the woods and so I can fully concentrate. Finally, people would leave him alone

286
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:36,260
so he could work on cast blaster. Hey, Mike. I heard you were camping out here in the neighborhood

287
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:42,740
of where I live. So I thought I would say hello. So we sat down and talked and talked about Adam Curry

288
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,300
and his own special way of podcasting. You know, when when Patricia walks in with a couple of

289
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,940
tea, he immediately, you know, switches on a second microphone. He says, just sit down and we'll talk a

290
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:57,220
little bit and improvise. He just goes to make a cup of coffee. Yeah, he just wants to see. I'm just

291
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:08,100
going to walk away. I'll be back. It comes back here, like, but do you, do you find that

292
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:15,700
of the way? No, no, no. It's funny. About the first idea for cast blaster. One part guess I will never

293
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:25,540
forget is that he was to the BBC in London and on his way back to the cottage. He made his show

294
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:34,820
in his car. In the car. Yeah. But he did that with, I think, a CD player, an MP3 recorder. I

295
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:42,820
think the I River and a separate mic and all kind of wires and it wasn't mess. And really difficult.

296
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:49,300
And very dangerous. Every day you scroll. Yeah. I thought, well, if he takes a laptop with him

297
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:55,380
and a little program, it should be a lot easier. So I wrote what later would be called cast blaster.

298
00:26:55,540 --> 00:27:00,900
Within an hour I had to reply like, this is what we need. About the future of podcasting and the

299
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:06,980
pot show delivery network. I listened to recently to an interview with Adam and with Ron Bloom on

300
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:12,180
podcast for one while and they were talking about their overall vision. It was the very first time

301
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:19,460
that I really started to grasp this whole idea of it's not just about some kind of way to commercially

302
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:25,380
link podcasting to advertisers. Way bigger than that. It's creating some kind of platform

303
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:30,980
that helps podcasters create an audience and gather an audience. And I'll start it out as a

304
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:37,940
technical solution to a problem. And it has turned into a social thing. If you want to join us in

305
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:44,100
mic's cottage and hear more, listen to the latest episodes of the Daily Breakfast at daily Breakfast.com.

306
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:49,540
The illustrious father, Roderick. Yeah. So if you want to know the Genesis of cast blaster and how

307
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,900
products like that come to life, that was a complete internet enterprise really how that worked.

308
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:00,580
And it's a beautiful story. I realize the problem will contain a lot about me. But that's

309
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,060
really the Genesis of cast blaster. It's cool to hear what cast blaster class need pop flessy.

310
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:11,860
Cast blaster mic is all about. Okay, a couple things to wrap it up. First of all, sad news. Very,

311
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:18,420
very sad news. One of my favorite UK podcast, although not really a UK podcast. But that I listened to,

312
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:25,300
to learn about British culture was the I miss blighty podcast. It shut down, which really sucks.

313
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:30,100
The host of the show works for broadcast. I can't say too much about it. Nor does he on this final

314
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:38,340
episode. But the host of the show works for broadcast organization and they took issue with his podcast.

315
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,620
And so I guess they've affected, he's shutting down before they shut him down. I believe. And I just

316
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:49,300
wanted to say, I'm really going to miss you, dude, because all those little Angloisms that you would

317
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,060
talk about, they're very helpful for me to understand the culture here. And it's funny how that

318
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:57,780
works. You know, when someone is away from the country and they talk about the country, they really

319
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:03,380
hit on a lot of topics that are often overlooked just in conversation in the country itself. So sad

320
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:09,300
day for that. Regarding the Gmail issue that I've been having some good news there, I received a

321
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,340
I received a Gmail from Danny, he says Google has a solution coming up for the issue. That's basically

322
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:19,940
of my drive filling up completely or my space filling up on Gmail. The solutions for business

323
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:24,980
users currently, I'm in a beta test with Google, whereby I modified my domain name's MX records. That's

324
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,420
basically, I remember I told you it's so good to have a domain name. Get yours now at godaddy.com

325
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,980
because you can change your MX records to have any email service work with your own domain name.

326
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:42,980
Use code DSC one and get some kind of groovy discount. So he pointed those towards Google servers once

327
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:48,820
Google verified the ownership he's now able to use the Google UI to read his own domain mail.

328
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,140
Where of course you can have terabytes of space if you want to. Of course this only helps

329
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:58,820
folks with a domain, but doesn't include support for hosted accounts such as GoDaddy. There you go.

330
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,260
Fantastic. So I'm very happy about that because I think that is indeed

331
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:08,500
the solution. I'm not quite sure how they how they index it though. I guess they have to have access to your

332
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:16,260
no wait a minute. Well, I don't know. We'll find out. But because if you point your MX records somewhere else,

333
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:21,300
then the files are going to the email is going to go somewhere else. Anyway, so I suppose the way it

334
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:25,620
works is you get the Google user interface, which I like so much. It better have the search in there.

335
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,700
If it doesn't have the search in it, I mean, this search-based email really, really works for me.

336
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,300
You know, whenever I say, oh, I remember there's some email I was supposed to look at something,

337
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,260
you know, you can enter just a couple of keywords and usually you'll find it on the first hit.

338
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:42,500
Google Gmail fantastic for that. But I would like to be able to utilize my own disk space. So if that's possible,

339
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:50,500
that'll be fantastic. One more here from Ellie Renner. Comment or mention that maybe you could have Uncle

340
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:59,380
Jesse. Wait, did someone say Uncle Jesse? Yeah, I don't know if he died. He's coming off. He's kind of

341
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:06,740
sued on. He's a Justin stuff. He's a sad-lap repair man coming after you. Sad-lap repair man,

342
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:11,620
what's he gonna do? He'll fit your misconceptions and answer questions too.

343
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:16,900
Nothing in the universe and he can't do for you. Sad-lap repair man.

344
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,380
Sad-lap repair man. Yeah.

345
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:29,700
So a comment or mention that maybe you could have Uncle Jesse come up with a best of show

346
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,020
for days that you're on a way on vacation. Along lines of user-generated content.

347
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:39,300
In fact, Ellie says, why not let your listeners do it. Just give us a few guidelines,

348
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,540
length, for example. And then sit back and wait. As your talented audience cobbles together,

349
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:48,580
their favorite moments from the Delta Sierra Charlie, you would still have full editorial control.

350
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:53,620
But hey, sounds like a win-win to me. Well, what do I think? Ellie from, what do you

351
00:31:54,100 --> 00:32:03,220
did? I'm sorry. It's WTFWJD.com. Nice. I think that's an excellent idea.

352
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:12,420
And we should calm the box. Best of Charlie's the box. So what would I need? Let me get the trusty

353
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:17,780
blackberry here. Let me look at the calendar. Oh, I missed a call already. Okay. Shit, there was a

354
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:25,140
charter plane call. Okay. Let me see. So I'm gone from the, so I need,

355
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:33,460
this April right three, one, two, three, so I need five. I'd only need seven shows

356
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:38,180
because although we return on the 10th, we're going to, it'll be actually the 11th before

357
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:43,780
back in the cottage. Yeah. So I would need seven shows. Can we do seven shows? That will be

358
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:49,060
completely awesome. Let's, you know, the best way to cut down the work for PDAB is if you can

359
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:54,900
actually make him 24 minutes and 30 seconds with the best of bits. I think that would be fantastic.

360
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:59,380
I can't give PDAB any more work to edit stuff together. But yeah, if you want to create a show

361
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:04,020
and please don't email it to me, put it up on a server so we can grab it and then we'll give you

362
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:09,060
full credit for putting the box together. That would be fantastic. I would love it. It'd be great

363
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:16,420
for the satellite folks, too. So please, yes, fantastic idea. And finally, yesterday I played a promo

364
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:23,940
for the Alpha Omega podcast, complete hip hop, received an email today from Otis. It says,

365
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:28,580
A to the D to the A M U to Man. Thanks for the shout out. A lot of you know, I will hit you back

366
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,860
this week and let you know what's going on. The clubs in Seattle in Portland as for the military

367
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:37,300
backgrounds. I was in Berlin in 89 when the wall came down and a lot of he was in West Germany in 1990.

368
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,940
We were in the same unit in Fort Lewis, Washington. And here's a hip hop song. We downloaded from

369
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:49,940
music.podshow.com. The song is called Blow Your Whistle is the Remix by Azemoff. So, that's a recommendation,

370
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:17,300
Like a jackhammer when I move to your dead toe

371
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:22,300
Flip it, flip it, rinse the crossbow, rinse it

372
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,300
Showing girl shirts with a wanna gun pistol

373
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:31,300
What a really wild style, my wild man's got a cool light

374
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,300

Like DJ singin' the matter to stir, I'm sayin'

381
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,300
You gon' make you dead, it's just rock to the rhythm

382
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,300
Shake you outta your pants, you didn't say it now

383
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,300
Ain't no need for you to sit down, people get like

00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,300
You know that this town, you do it all the time

That's part of the plan, it's about this, y'all all over the jam

386
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,300
When the beat came, y'all know it's the remix

00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,300
We can get live, it's gon' leave, it's the mistake

388
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,300
When the end, you makes you get a let you know

389
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,300
When I'm a whistle, many whistle, home, oil, let's go

390
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,300
Go away, go away, go away, go away

391
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,300
Oh, damn it, I'm smashin' back with smashin' flash

392
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,300
Like a shit, I'm blastin' loads with fries

393
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,300
I'm faking flake, get a crackin' in face, playin' shake like a false

394
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,300
Get a hit, hide a scotch, spray, get it raw

395
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,300
While you get it on tape, I'ma take my ass, break it my life

396
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,300
I'm sorry, the auditory on this motion

397
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,300
Like as his ass, he need low shit

398
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,300
So it's forget, war will force for five minutes

399
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,300
Live to the far back, get a scotch, pop, pop

400
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,300
Now he's still flyin', he's like a B boy

401
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,300
But saw hands in the sky, hands throw the party, pop

402
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,300
Swallow like one of the highs, on your mighty sides

403
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,300
Every little world you turn before, where you live

404
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,300
It's real, it's real, it's real, it's real

405
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,300
And I need a hollow back for you

406
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,300
Now I'm in the go, go

407
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,300
Oh, yo whistle, and blow, yo whistle, just blow, yo whistle

Just blow, yo whistle, and blow, yo whistle

Just blow, yo whistle, and blow, yo whistle

Just blow, yo whistle

414
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:10,300
As I'm all fucking the jammers, not an issue

415
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,300
These suckers and transplants, they all on a fish show

416
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,300
The don'tness rockin' every style on the menu

417
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,300
It's to get the team keepin' in line

418
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,300
And then if you've been, you'll never use WW

419
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,300
We rockin' spot with 100 mags of my legs

420
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,300
And show the shot right on 100 mags

421
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,300
Like get live in your spot, y'all come

422
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,300
People checkin' the rhyme, they love it all the time

423
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,300
All the time, all the time, I mean to get me to cook it

424
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,300
I was, yeah, I can flip a record

425
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,300
Who's my Billy Cyrus?

426
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,300
It's a race, he's out of my brain, furnace, I burn

427
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,300
But I want to recharge him, blow, hot, follow

428
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,300
So, and we're at the end of this, I'll probably sample this

429
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,300
To cook it rockin' that fat, the record's fine

430
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,300
And he may have got beats for miles

431
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,300
And then ain't your boy, it's therapy for flys down

432
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,300
The car imposes it for get away

433
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,300
You catch this mega-hike tonight

434
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,300
He's got co-hatty so we can skate on my joke

435
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,300
Cooler than I fan fooler with the man

436
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,300
When like we need to get the football ball go band with a more horse

437
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,300
Cause you know base that you have, for the people that I see

438
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,300
Many stars as grand

439
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,300
But like low on heel, they mess around with triads

440
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,300
My soul purpose and my rage is to get you empty

441
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,300
That's how you can jump

442
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,300
You get the ready to throw the rules

443
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,300
To the play, man, it wasn't my fault

444
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,300
This data, adrenaline rushes your late

445
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,300
And you scold that heights

446
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,300
Like you might go mix with red balls

447
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,500
It's the fist to keep the bugs

448
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,500
Waste slapping your bones

449
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,300
Square balls

450
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,300
I'm not an exclusive club that dunks to my

451
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,300
Be the music that's gonna let them know the guy

452
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,300
Make me forget your worries of the show

453
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,300
Anyone I know the lad

454
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,300
Still take it to the bed

455
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,300
There's y'all many people

456
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,300
It might move on the head

457
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah

458
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,300
Let's go, go, go

459
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,300

460
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,300
Yo whistle just blow your whistle

461
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,300
Oh, you whistle damn blow

Yo whistle down blow

467
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,300
When you eat some free steamed slice and dowter to the tissue

468
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,300
Any six of these warm?

469
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,380
traveled

470
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,780
Basics changes life and downs

471
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,220
They teach you

472
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:34,220
Yeah, just blow your whistle.

473
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,220
Thank you guys for giving me just an ounce of street cred.

474
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,220
We're going to find that on the pot-save music networks.

475
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,220
Cool to hear the hip hop on music.co.com.

476
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,220
I want to know how this would sound on the club, man.

477
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,220
Shoot.

478
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,220
Someone please play the club.

479
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,220
Let me know what people think.

480
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,220
I think it's highly sensible.

481
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,220
And that's it for the Charlie Ford today.

482
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,220
Again tomorrow, we'll find out if the Golden Ticket worked.

483
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,220
And I'll see you back here.

484

I'll be able to do a Friday show as well.

485
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,220
And then it's on vacation.

486
