Bring it back, and shake it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm taking their own words to hard, bring it back, sing it back, Malico, on the Pod Save Music Network.

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's really nice.

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I think what happened is the rights to the masters, either were sold or reverted, but apparently owned by an entity called Maloco catalog.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
There you go.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This is what you can do with you.

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Put it on the Pod Save Music Network, get some pod play, sell some tracks.

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Of course, we're open for business now.

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Anyone who any artist or band or whatever, anyone who puts up stuff on the Pod Save Music Network,

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
you can select which tracks you want to be for sale from 99 cents.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
9 cents of that goes to the transaction company, the rest goes to the artist.

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So it's a good deal all around.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Everybody, how you doing?

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's episode 504 of the Daily Source Code coming to you from Curry Cottage.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The current Curry Cottage, of course.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
In just weeks from now, about seven weeks, we will be...

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Is it even seven weeks?

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Less than that.

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Six weeks.

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We'll be moving to the new Curry Cottage on the other side of the tracks here in Guilford.

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I feel like shit today.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I gotta tell you.

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
God didn't yesterday morning from San Francisco.

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I think I did sleep about four hours on the flight.

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The flight was actually was nice.

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We had a tailwind.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So nine hours and 20 minutes.

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And we landed it.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Actually, we were above Heathrow at 10 past 10.

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So a full 40 minute ahead of schedule.

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And of course, we had to stay in the holding pattern for about 10 minutes.

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And then we landed.

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And then all you knew was going to happen.

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Well, the gate, of course, isn't ready.

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So you never win anything on that.

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So we still de-plained around 11 a.m.

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Came back.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I did, I caulked out for a couple hours on the couch yesterday afternoon.

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's just, it's hard.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm not complaining or anything.

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But this morning, my stomach is a little upset.

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm running a little bit of a fever.

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I know it's just my body.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's just winging out.

123
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Anyway, plenty to do this week.

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I think there's a whole bunch of yanks in town for the digital Hollywood London,

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
which sounds like a mistake.

126
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Digital Hollywood London.

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Anyway, and I believe I'm on a panel on Wednesday.

128
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So I'm not quite sure what it's all about.

129
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I think this is the thing that I was held earlier in the year in Hollywood.

130
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Los Angeles, at least surprise surprise.

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So I've got to find out what's going on there.

132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I know that there's lots of people in the UK.

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
We're going to be attending this.

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So it should be very interesting.

135
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Unless you forget what the Daily Source Code is all about.

136
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Please, feast your ears on this movie style promo.

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
In a world where corporate monstrosities control the airways.

138
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
A new media has a risen.

139
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
One man leads the internet rebellion that will change the world forever.

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Potua Productions presents Adam Curry as the podfather in the Daily Source Code.

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Witness the pain.

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Fuck me.

143
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I didn't work or I wanted to.

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Brahman that used to suck so bad and the pleasure.

145
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And I went into the bathroom and got myself off.

146
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Biting my lips the whole time so that nobody would hear me.

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
As the podfather saves the world,

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
as only a former MTVVJ can with extreme prejudice.

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You are such a dick weed.

150
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Get the fuck out of my office.

151
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Deep in the bowels of the curry cottage.

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Lands are set.

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Splendid consumed.

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And soon humanity will experience a reckoning.

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That usually fucks companies up.

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
For the next year there's going to be a lot of turmoil and radio.

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Trim everything down get rid of the quote excess fat.

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Which usually comes in the home.

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You know chop people up into bits.

160
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So I think this is the time we need to strike, strike, strike, strike.

161
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Don't miss this daily event because if you do.

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000

169
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Now you heard me talking about Mark Yoshimotanemkov using the real movie guy voice.

170
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And as I said, all I want is I just want one of those from my own that starts with in the world

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
where women wear comfortable shoes or something like that.

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And he started off with in a world.

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Thanks buddy.

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That really made me smile.

175
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And you heard the giselle in there.

176
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm not sure if there was an email problem because you know I get all these voice

177
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
emails.

178
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I get emailed to me as.

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm not even as way files as like G at the GSM protocol or something.

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You can open it in quick time and then I can export them as AIFF and then re-import

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
them as MP3s etc.

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But I only had one message from giselle which I played for you on Thursday the day after

183
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Thanksgiving because she was coming up from San Diego to meet me.

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And so now all of a sudden I got like three messages from her.

185
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Let's just play them and then enjoy together.

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Hey Adam, it's me just now.

187
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So I went into the little store and I was able to find a prepaid phone.

188
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So here's my number for one five.

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And it cuts off right there.

190
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So now I couldn't have called her anyway because I didn't get these until yesterday.

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But you can almost almost see the saga that she went.

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I guess she really did come up to San Francisco.

193
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm feeling pretty bad about this right now.

194
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Hey Adam.

195
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So I went into an internet cafe today and I wanted to listen to some of the shows that I missed.

196
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And I heard you talking about me and how all of a sudden you didn't want me to come up to San Francisco.

197
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I thought you wanted me to come up.

198
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Anyway, I'm a little bit pissed off and I really need to think about things.

199
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So I'll just call you later.

200
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Bye.

201
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay.

202
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So now I'm feeling bad.

203
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But you know, you have to understand Gizelle after getting a call like this.

204
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I don't know who this is but stop fucking calling Gizelle at all.

205
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You know, I got a little bit worried.

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And then after that I got calls like this.

207
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't know who the fuck you are, but stop putting what you're also.

208
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And and it gets worse.

209
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Hey.

210
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't know who this is.

211
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
But stop calling me specifically.

212
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I know.

213
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Sorry.

214
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Hey Adam.

215
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Okay.

216
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I feel like a total dumb ass jerk for coming all the way up here to San Francisco.

217
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Thinking that you wanted to see me.

218
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So I'm just going to go back to San Diego now.

219
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't want to bug you anymore.

220
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Bye.

221
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
No, Gizelle.

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I feel pretty stupid about this.

223
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Listen.

224
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I think we can still carry on our our long distance voice mail relationship.

225
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And I love the pictures you've been sending me.

226
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You know, you come and I'm just freaking me out.

227
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Again, it was certainly after this call that I got to break.

228
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't know who this is, but stop fucking calling Gizelle at all.

229
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I am in so much trouble.

230
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Hi.

231
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This is Jim Farley of the Musical World podcast.

232
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And I'd like to invite you and all of your listeners over to musicalworld.us to listen to the interview.

233
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I had with the beautiful.

234
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And the charming.

235
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Carmen Tyler.

236
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I hate it because I'm so Gary.

237
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I know you'll find her as sweet as you can ever imagine.

238
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So when you're done with the Charlie,

239
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
swing on over to musical world and download episode 21.

240
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I know you'll love it.

241
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Hey, this is Carmen Tyler.

242
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Check out my interview and a whole bunch more on musical world podcast.

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's really, I'm like, give this a clear area.

244
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And we had a couple.

245
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I mean, I just don't want to be offensive.

246
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Oh, yes.

247
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The lovely and talented Carmen Tyler.

248
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Still waiting for those naked pictures.

249
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Other cool things on the network that I wanted to bring to your attention.

250
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The high fee show.

251
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
If you're never seeing the high fee show, you've got to check this out.

252
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Kevin App's legendary in the Bay Area as a movie producer.

253
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Creating a show.

254
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's called the high fee show.

255
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
H-Y-P-H-Y dot pod show dot com.

256
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
High fee.

257
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And the host on the show is Malica, who's also done stuff on MTV.

258
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And she has a brief but very interesting interview with Snoop Dogg.

259
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
When he came, I guess he came to the Bay Area and they've got all kinds of live footage of him performing.

260
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
See, might want to take a look at that.

261
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Had some other stuff that I wanted to bring your attention to.

262
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh, did you see, I don't know if you if you've looked at the feed or at the site for a

263
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
podcast con uk, which is podcast con uk dot pod show dot com.

264
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
That's the one I'm going to point you to because there's a whole wrap up there that I think

265
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I told you this of Jill Mills and Robert Dolby did a video show.

266
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's really good.

267
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You should take a look at it.

268
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But there's something you'll see in the video as I was looking at it on the plane right home.

269
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
There's lots of people.

270
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I forget it was a podcast Paul who was selling those t-shirts.

271
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
He had some awesome t-shirts.

272
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Which looked very much like the old t-shirt home taping is killing the music.

273
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
We had a cassette with a cross through it.

274
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So now that the cassette is kind of turned into a skull and cross bones.

275
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And the actual t-shirt says podcasting is selling music.

276
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I really like it.

277
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Unfortunately, I think they were all sold out by the time I got there.

278
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But maybe someone could put one up on eBay or something.

279
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And I'd be happy to take off your hands because I just love the concept of that podcasting is selling music.

280
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And you know it.

281
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Every year on a special winter day,

282
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Little podcaster girls and boys wake up early to find something special in their iPods.

283
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Little do they know how close they came to losing it all.

284
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Ah, humbug.

285
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The podcast community presents a podcast Christmas Carol.

286
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
A special adaptation of Charles Dickens classic tale of broadcast mobile Ebony's or Scrooge.

287
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And the visitation of three ghosts on Christmas Eve.

288
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And I suppose you'll expect me to just play this little promo for free.

289
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Visit a podcast Christmas Carol.com.

290
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And listen, as Scrooge has shown his tragic feature and learns to share the spirit of the Christmas season.

291
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Go stop your own radio station.

292
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
A podcast Christmas Carol.

293
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Featuring talents from the podcasting community, including Adam Curry.

294
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And say yo.

295
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Leo Leport.

296
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And starring David Lawrence as Ebony's or Scrooge.

297
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Visit a podcast Christmas Carol.com.

298
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The future is just around the corner.

299
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Seems like so long ago yet really just short short time ago really if you think about it.

300
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Last year we were doing all that stuff.

301
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The podcast Christmas Carol.

302
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
If you've never heard it, definitely go and check that out.

303
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's awesome.

304
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Very well produced.

305
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I think the 30 or 40 different podcasts participated in that, of course.

306
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Around the same time we had podcasts for peace, which I'll be playing all the way up through Christmas.

307
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Obviously.

308
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Not today though.

309
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I got a different Christmas tune queueed up for you, which I think you like.

310
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Lots of comments about the accessibility of the upgraded pod show plus.

311
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Some people saying that it's completely unusable.

312
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Then I got an email from Tino, Tino Fella.

313
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Or what?

314
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Let's see.

315
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm almost blind myself.

316
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I appreciate the way you reacted.

317
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Right now I have no opportunity to do an audio comment.

318
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Okay.

319
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Speaking for myself, pod show.com is still pretty well accessible.

320
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Even the new embedded player on the music segment works easy because the buttons can also be activated with the

321
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Interkeys.

322
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Sometimes I have to hit it twice.

323
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But I don't care.

324
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It works.

325
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The only problem is the dashboard.

326
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Here's if you click play it.

327
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
To play a show, of course.

328
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
A few weeks ago you said there would be a download link on the board.

329
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
My screen reader, which Tino uses jaws, doesn't show any links.

330
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Maybe it's not a text-based link.

331
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Of course, the show starts playing normally for me, but the most important thing.

332
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
By the way.

333
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Okay.

334
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yeah.

335
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I think the big problem here is with flash.

336
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
That's when I'm understanding.

337
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The dashboard has gone from a straight Ajax.

338
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Actually, kind of a combination of Ajax.

339
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Javascript.

340
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Of course, that would be a part of Ajax.

341
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What's a specific JavaScript call.

342
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
There was even some flash-based stuff in there.

343
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
We've changed that to all flash.

344
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
There is a download link there, but I can understand.

345
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I think it's baked into the flash.

346
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So what we have to do is we have to pull that out of the flash.

347
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So that the screen readers can access.

348
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Obviously, yeah, if you're able to tab to the play it link, and you hit enter,

349
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and then that works.

350
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And it's playing that's fantastic.

351
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But if you want to take it with you, I guess, on a mobile device,

352
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
we have to expose the download link differently.

353
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So I will get on that.

354
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I've also received some other messages, people saying that actually the code isn't all that bad.

355
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
There's only a few things that have to be changed in order for some of the screen readers to work.

356
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Oh.

357
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Hi, Adam.

358
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Nice to see you.

359
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I didn't want to play that right now.

360
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm sorry.

361
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Here's the one I want to play.

362
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Hi, Adam.

363
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
This is Bob Netherway in Bristol, South West England.

364
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm a freedom box user, and I'm having problems downloading and listening to your shows

365
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
since the new home page came in.

366
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
My email is Bob Netherway.

367
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's the NETH, the RWAY, at myfreedombox.com.

368
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I look forward to hearing from you.

369
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Goodbye.

370
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah, freedom box.

371
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But it sounds like that's an online application.

372
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm going to have to look into that.

373
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But as I said, we've got plenty of people pitching in the house,

374
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
so we'll get it fixed with us soon.

375
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Let's do it for the U.S. folks as well.

376
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So there's this whole long, uh, I just noticed that it's six and a half minutes long.

377
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
This reply about Chris Moiles from David Graham here in the UK.

378
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Let me just give you a little bit of it, okay?

379
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Hi, Adam.

380
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Listen to the feedback you receive from your listeners about the mention you've got from

381
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Radio 1 DJ Chris Moiles.

382
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I have to reply and make some corrections.

383
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
A response from one of your listeners called James made out the Chris Moiles was a game's podcasting

384
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and so no future in it.

385
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
This is incorrect.

386
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Chris actively promotes his podcast, which in turn educates the public about podcasting.

387
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You know, so then he plays all these clips of Chris Moiles.

388
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It really is interesting if you really are interested in the topic, which I am.

389
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But six and a half minutes is just too long for me to do it, but I do appreciate it.

390
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Give me a pointer, put this thing up on the online somewhere, so people can go access it.

391
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't just want to put it up without your permission.

392
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But apparently, and this is something I didn't know.

393
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And that's the clip that would have rolled for the next two minutes, two and a half minutes.

394
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Chris, as a employee of the BBC, is not allowed to make any content specifically for the podcast.

395
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It has to be content that is aired on the BBC.

396
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I find this very entertaining and interesting.

397
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Now, what a missed opportunity.

398
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Here's a whole extra channel, a whole distribution channel.

399
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
They can take advantage of, but they're just not allowed to do it.

400
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And there's other stuff in there, but I thought that was the most relevant piece of what

401
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
was his name again.

402
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Sorry about that.

403
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
David, what David sent in, sent in to me.

404
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So I wonder, I wonder what the BBC's plans are.

405
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I mean, you would think that if these guys are brimming with creativity,

406
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
they should be allowed to put that out there, don't you?

407
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Hey, Adam Chris, daily hear from a many, many podcasts that you name it,

408
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
writing with the window down the PMC top there and Lone Star Grid,

409
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I heard the list goes on and on.

410
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I wanted to mention, I just put the wraps on show number 429.

411
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And here you are approaching 510.

412
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
My hats off to you.

413
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I know what it takes to put together 429.

414
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And I started, gosh, a few months after you.

415
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So kudos to you on halfway to a thousand.

416
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Can you believe it?

417
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And one of those shows, you'll remember from a year ago,

418
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
because you were one of the stars.

419
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
That's right.

420
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You were a rostophariant Jacob Marley in a podcast Christmas carol.

421
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I think it would be a great time for you to spend that promo out.

422
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And hey, when you're sitting down with Leo Leport,

423
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
remind him that you two were virtually in a show together already,

424
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
a podcast Christmas carol.

425
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Thanks, Adam, and as always, keep it real.

426
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah, so much for scheduling.

427
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Oh, my audio is today.

428
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Sorry.

429
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Screw that one up.

430
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yeah, I'll be on the Twitter next week, everybody.

431
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Let's put these dropping in again.

432
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm all alone out of work tonight.

433
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I used to have a spring in my step,

434
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
but now something is missing.

435
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And I know it's not right.

436
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Last year, I was good and oh,

437
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Charlie St. Nick was too to his word.

438
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I was the top of the list of all those who were blessed.

439
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
But this year, I don't know.

440
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I give back those toys and gadgetagnic,

441
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
nags that he left under the tree.

442
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Don't need the sweater and the jacket and the egg.

443
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
No, I've had it and it's no good for me.

444
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
If this year, I've been thinking that I don't need a thing.

445
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You get hiding a box, it's true.

446
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
There's all I want for Christmas is some hugging,

447
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
and it's kissing from you.

448
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I give up my life.

449
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I watch a flow of blackberry.

450
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I don't need to make any calls.

451
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
No, don't need my sling box.

452
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Maybe you could call me crazy.

453
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I don't watch it at all.

454
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
The magic bullet, the toaster,

455
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
or the thing that makes the roast beef,

456
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
that's not on TV.

457
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Oh, my brand new vendor, tell a castor.

458
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It don't mean nothing to me.

459
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
No, I give back those toys and gadgetagnic,

460
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
nags that he left under the tree.

461
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Don't need the sweater and the jacket and the egg.

462
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
No, I've had it and it's no good for me.

463
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Oh, this year, I've been thinking that I don't need a thing.

464
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You get hiding a box, it's true.

465
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
There's all I want for Christmas is some hugging,

466
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
and it's kissing from you.

467
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Yeah, you know what's in it.

468
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It's travel, baby, don't leave me blue and I'll be here.

469
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Let's start something new.

470
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yeah, I give back those toys and gadgetagnic,

471
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
nags that he left under the tree.

472
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Don't need the sweater and the jacket and the egg.

473
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
No, I've had it and it's no good for me.

474
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
This year, I've been thinking that I don't need a thing.

475
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You get hiding a box, it's true.

476
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
There's all I want for Christmas is some hugging,

477
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and it's a kiss, and it's a squeeze, and it's a love,

478
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
and it's a sweet turtle, nothing.

479
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I have a wanted on my Christmas, and on it was you.

480
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Oh, yeah.

481
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
The Jeff Smith, everybody.

482
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
It's the Christmas hugging, as you, baby.

483
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And kiss them from you.

484
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Now available on the Podsate Music Network.

485
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000

486
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Look at the show notes for today's episode.

It's a nice little player there.

491
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You can embed the player in your web blog or any page you want to.

492
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And of course, many of Jeff's tracks are enabled for sales.

You can buy it and help a brother out.

494
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Patricia walks by when I'm playing that song.

495
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
This morning says, hey, that's the guy who did the lady

496
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
and the Atom.

497
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Atom's.

498
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Atom's.

499
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Atom's.

500
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
All alone.

501
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And he needs his love right there on the microphone.

502
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
So here she is, yes, the lady Patricia.

503
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
The say to have some better than one.

504
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And with this angel from above,

505
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
There's nothing that they both can't do.

506
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I make you while this dream's come true.

507
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:22,780
It's Adam and Patricia, so that is G Jeff Smith, G-E-O-F-O, that is

508
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:26,160
Jeff Smith, DJF Smith.com.

00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,760
And she said something really exciting.

510
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,320
She said, wow, you know, this guy is unbelievable.

511
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,600
He just, he can just shake shit like that right out of his, out of his arms, no problem.

512
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,480
He just does it whenever he wants to, what a talent, and I said, and she said, hey,

513
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,240
do you think that I could do a song with him?

514
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,240
Like, what?

515
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,240
I can't believe it.

516
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,840
It's the first time she said something like this in a long, long time.

517
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,360
And so her concept, I guess, is she wants to do her tracks here.

518
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,040
So, Jeff, if you're listening, I hope you are.

519
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,560
I know you're a little behind on the listening.

520
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:02,640
She'd love to do some kind of song, like this, like a swing big band type thing with you.

521
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,240
She'd like to record her tracks here.

522
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,640
Wouldn't that be cool?

523
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,680
And it would be a great collaboration, I think, so let's see if we can make that happen.

524
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,640
And I'd say that, you know, I'd get her on the show, but tomorrow morning she leaves

525
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,320
a very early, she'll leave the house around 530.

526
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,480
She's going to the Netherlands, once again, to practice, once again, for the dancing with

527
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,280
the stars, extravaganza, she'll be on at the end of the year.

528
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,080
It's going to be a very interesting show.

529
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:39,160
She leaves tomorrow, she comes back Thursday, then I leave on Monday or Tuesday, I leave

530
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,160
for San Francisco for good, you know, 10 days or something like that.

531
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:49,360
And in that meantime, she's going back, oh, hey, it's a true show, bid in the family.

532
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,800
And that's what it takes.

533
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,000
Okay, everybody, I'll be back tomorrow.

534
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,680
Yeah, so keep sending your stuff, love to hear from you.

535
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,680
Talk to you then.

536
