00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Chericharly 315

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Delta Chericharly, saints of Seedini

3
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hey!

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Sunday!

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Sunday!

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Friday!

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
La la la la!

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Friday!

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Friday!

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
La la la la!

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And then comes it's Saturday!

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Saturday!

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
La la la la!

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's Sunday!

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Sunday!

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
La la la la!

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And then it's Monday!

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Me!

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've never sleep anymore.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And I can't be with you anymore.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And I can't be with you anymore.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And I can see in the darkness.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Since you left me in the dark.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I replicines from our intention.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But on the streets I'm not here yet.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And I've got a torn screen on the brakes.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's rising right above the end.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I've never been the same again.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Not since I had the operation.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The surgeons ripped down my heart.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But they left me with a brain.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yeah, but they left me with a brain.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yeah, but they left me with a brain.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So I watch movies in the darkness.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
They will recognize me.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But they're all sub-titling.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
They're all sub-titling.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
They're all sub-titling.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
They're all sub-titling.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
They're all sub-titling.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
They're all sub-titling.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But I don't speak Chinese.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So I'll just never understand.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Why you don't have any more?

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And why your boyfriend wants to kill me?

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Can't I watch this film?

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
For in the morning.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
For when I have to kill her.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So I can't earn me a living.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So I can have a place to see.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Or not depending.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm always playing at the multiplex.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And what is playing at the movies?

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I need a Chinese phrase book.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Free-caxant and Chinese phrase book.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Good morning, everybody.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Or good afternoon.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Good evening.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is the Daily Source Code.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Sorry, microphone movement there.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's a Friday.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And I saw that band perform last night.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Free-caxant.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Uh-huh.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And around midnight, they showed up on the podcast music network.

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
How beautiful is that?

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't know.

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Remove the blackberry.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So are you just starting here?

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yesterday we had a little celebration at the pod show offices here in San Francisco.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It was in honor of my partner, Ron Bloom's birthday.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I won't disclose his actual age.

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Well, let's just say he's old enough to receive the PlayStation portable from me.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So he's at that ripe old age.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And part of the celebrations was having a band perform.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And the band that was chosen.

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm not quite sure who the committee was.

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But I was real happy.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This is actually the band that big mic from extra super-action show just joined.

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He's on drugs, man.

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Mic is great on drums.

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He kind of reminded the way he drums, although not necessarily in this song.

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Reminds me a bit of the way I just watching him actually.

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Reminds me a bit of the way that Mick Fleet would place the drums.

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And it was great.

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And what was amazing is that even though this song wasn't on the pod safe music network,

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm pretty sure the big mic played it on the extra super-action show within the past couple of weeks.

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And I'm sitting down.

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm sitting at the band and all of a sudden the song comes down like, I know this song.

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And once again, it was just, you know, it hit me.

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So hard that, you know, the concept that you need mainstream music to be, you know,

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
to create a show that people will enjoy is just not true.

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's just about the recognition.

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Once you've heard it, you know, and if it hits your DNA the right way, you're going to love it.

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You're going to recognize it and you're going to want to hear more of it,

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and you're probably going to want to buy something I would hope.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And that is a piece of news from yesterday that really I'm really excited about.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The very first, of course, is not publicly available yet, but the very first transaction of a track

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
from the pod safe music network purchased all the way through with a credit card

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
with a free and clear MP3 download was executed yesterday by Chris Rockwell.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I think he and Michael Butler are doing the testing now.

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And so it works.

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So now it's just, you know, a matter of getting all the nuts and bolts and pieces together.

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And of course, we have to come up with the right, you know, well, with the right offering.

107
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And this is going to be really, really interesting for the pricing of songs

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
of the pod safe music network.

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And obviously, this is something that we're discussing with artists,

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
we're discussing with just people who love music.

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And also looking at the industry, the word on the street without a doubt,

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
is that Apple is being squeezed very, very, very tightly by the record industry

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
because they want flexible pricing.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And their whole thing is, hey, look, if a song is really popular,

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
we should be able to charge more for it.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That's fine.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But it's definitely going to break the 99 cent model.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And I don't think Apple is going to be able to hold out.

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I think in the in Japan, it's already happened.

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And it will more than likely happen in the rest of the world.

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So that'll be pretty fun to see, you know, if you can, what people are going to do.

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Here's something on the radio and then maybe buy the track on iTunes,

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
or which could be a buck 99, or here's something on a podcast

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and be able to purchase that much, much cheaper.

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And of course, artists will always have the option I presume

126
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
to cut the price down to zero if they just want to give it away,

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
very much like iTunes does now.

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Anyway, my head is just buzzing.

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So it was a long day yesterday.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm sorry I didn't have a chance to bring you a show.

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And that was just a million different factors,

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
including the fact that I started the morning off with a daily download

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I've rekindled the show for Chris Rockwell.

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm not going to play you any pieces from it,

135
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
because I'm not particularly proud of what I did,

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
but I did take one for the team to make sure.

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I took one for the team to make sure that we could actually have

138
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
the continuation of that fabulous podcast.

139
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Another podcast I, oh shoot, I didn't queue up a piece for you.

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Let me see, maybe I can get one of their promos, one of their snippets.

141
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Found out that there's two other guys who are doing podcasts

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
who work at the Pod Show HQ.

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Hold on, I think it's stuck on the bridge.com.

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This is Brian and Matt who drive in,

145
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
who cross the Bay Bridge every day to come into work.

146
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
They decided to do a podcast together.

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Let me see.

148
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And so they basically do a stereo podcast in the car

149
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
while they're stuck on the bridge.

150
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Okay, they got a couple of clips up here

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
on stuck on the bridge.com.

152
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Let's check this one out for a second.

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You farted!

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Damn it, man!

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Trying to tell us what to do.

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Shit!

157
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Son of a bitch!

158
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Damn that's bad!

159
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Woo!

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Smells like baby food and fraud!

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I can't tell you how much better I feel right now.

162
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's kind of clean in myself out here, apparently.

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Woo!

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let it all go!

165
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Wow!

166
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay, glad you guys are doing that in your vehicle

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and not in the office if you know what I'm saying.

168
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Plenty of comments about the new Apple announcements

169
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and the hardware and the software that Apple has come out with

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and Michael Black was kind enough to email me and say that

171
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
there's a very little reason you should be bummed out about the Mac world

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
announcements.

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Your eye Mac and power book are no less cool

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
because the new machines are faster.

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That kind of mentality is probably cost you a lot of money.

176
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And as one big-haired fag to another,

177
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I totally understand.

178
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So quick math reveals that the top MacBook is approximately

179
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
the same speed as my dual two gigahertz power Mac.

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And the new 20-inch eye Mac is probably even a wee bit faster.

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Didn't you find the, oh, this is a good one.

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Did you find the inclusion of an FM receiver

183
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
in the wired remote for the new iPods a little insulting

184
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
or at least pointless?

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Well, Michael, let me tell you.

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's very logical when you think about it.

187
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Now Apple made a decision early on with their fair play DRM

188
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
that they were going to work with Hollywood

189
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and big, big, big props to Apple for really being able to create

190
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
the iPod, which of course without a doubt is the device that

191
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
most people aspire to have even though there's plenty of people

192
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
buying other MP3 players.

193
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And of course there was the connection with the iTunes music store.

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So it really made a lot of sense and it really kickstarted the mobile audio

195
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
revolution without a doubt, certainly from the music side.

196
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And so I told you about the squeeze that's coming in

197
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
from the record companies.

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So it's very obvious that the, and just go look at iTunes.

199
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Look at the podcasting section iTunes and you'll see that there's probably

200
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
80 to 85% is all mainstream media content that is being

201
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
repurposed as a podcast.

202
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So these are, you know, the relationships that Apple has.

203
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's okay, you know, that's what they, so they talk to the mainstream media

204
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
both on the music side as well as on the broadcast side.

205
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And so it makes sense that the radio partners were saying,

206
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
hey, why don't you put a radio into that iPod?

207
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You know, and what what penalty is there to Apple?

208
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
No, and I think, you know, every other MP3 player on the planet

209
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
almost has an FM radio built in.

210
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Most cell phones have FM radios built in.

211
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So there's no penalty to them.

212
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't find it insulting at all.

213
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I won't use it.

214
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I have a, I have an FM receiver on my eye river,

215
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
which I think I've used once just to see how well it worked.

216
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And, you know, that was about it.

217
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So I don't feel insulted at all.

218
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm just very happy that we're able to route around

219
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
the pre-existing relationships and do our own that thing,

220
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
if you know what I'm saying.

221
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So instead of building an FM receiver into some device,

222
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
well, we do stuff like this.

223
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
This is Lori.

224
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And this is Joe.

225
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
He's a guy.

226
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
She's a girl.

227
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And we're on the pod show.

228
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We are two novice wine drinkers who have been podcasting on location

229
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
from wineries in Northern California reviewing the wineries

230
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and their wines.

231
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
A guy, a girl at a bottle podcast,

232
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
or thrilled to join the pod show family

233
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and have taken the first steps down the path

234
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
to eventually quitting our day jobs.

235
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Be sure to look for a guy, a girl

236
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and a bottle on the pod show network at podshow.com.

237
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So Adam, now that it's official,

238
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
when are you in the pod show folks going to join us

239
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
for wine tasting to celebrate?

240
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Lori, pass the wine.

241
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
No, it's mine.

242
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
No, you had too much.

243
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
No, no.

244
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It is mine.

245
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
All right.

246
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Joe and Lori, a guy growing a bottle.

247
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Congratulations guys.

248
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And welcome to the family.

249
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Very happy to have you on board.

250
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
As I've mentioned on this show a couple of times

251
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
in the next few weeks,

252
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
we're bringing in a whole bunch of new podcasts

253
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
into the network.

254
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
These are predominantly people

255
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
that I meant at the pod cast,

256
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
or the portable media expo

257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
that are known as the podcast expo.

258
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And they're also going to be using our new system,

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
the new system, which in time,

260
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and we're moving pretty fast,

261
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
will become available to anyone

262
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
who wants to create a podcast

263
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and let me reiterate anyone.

264
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Okay, for free.

265
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And what that for free means is you come into the network,

266
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
you get all the network services.

267
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And that guy goes beyond hosting

268
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and bandwidth,

269
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
which of course is not to be underestimated,

270
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
because bandwidth is not free.

271
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It may seem free.

272
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
We'll give you tools.

273
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh man,

274
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
cast blasters.

275
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Now,

276
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I believe it's,

277
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
it's now completely connected

278
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
with the latest version of cast blaster,

279
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
where you record your podcast,

280
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and then you just hit a button,

281
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
and it uploads everything automatically

282
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
up to the,

283
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
to the pod show podcast delivery network.

284
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It makes your entry on your show site.

285
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It just does the whole thing for you.

286
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
One click and you're done.

287
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
To,

288
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
you know,

289
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I can't wait to the sum of the stuff to come out.

290
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That should be ready about the same time

291
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
that we're ready to open up to anyone

292
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
who wants to come in in podcast.

293
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And guys,

294
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
absolutely.

295
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'd love to polish off a bottle.

296
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Hey, I'm in San Francisco

297
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
until next Saturday,

298
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
so come on by the office.

299
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
We should start around noon.

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Let's see.

301
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I picked up another piece of audio from,

302
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
is this the head of green,

303
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
you know,

304
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I keep listening,

305
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
this head of green podcast.

306
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And I really,

307
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
you know,

308
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I've been listening to it.

309
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's the business week podcast.

310
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Now,

311
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
she's had,

312
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I think,

313
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
yeah,

314
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I've been on the show,

315
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
runs been on the show,

316
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
but also CEO from,

317
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
no way,

318
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
that was different show.

319
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What I hear recently,

320
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
the guy was responsible for podcast at CBS.

321
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Just all kinds of movers and shakers

322
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
that she,

323
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
that she gets in this podcast.

324
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And I really enjoy listening to it.

325
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And on the,

326
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'd miss this one on the December 21,

327
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
she did an interview with,

328
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
a pair of very successful podcast.

329
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
There's the mommy casters,

330
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
who are,

331
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
well,

332
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
mommy casters,

333
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
of course,

334
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
can never quit their day job,

335
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
because,

336
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
well,

337
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
you know,

338
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
the job of a mom,

339
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
just is not equitable,

340
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
but they are doing extremely well.

341
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
They got a great sponsorship from,

342
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Dixie,

343
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
paper,

344
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
products.

345
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And of course,

346
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
they're a member of the pod show network.

347
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And I just want to play a little bit,

348
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
of this interview,

349
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
which I hadn't heard yet.

350
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's a pretty interesting where Heather talks a little bit about,

351
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
about the network itself,

352
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and the mommy casters,

353
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
actually get into the pod safe music network.

354
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So, let me play a little bit of this,

355
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
because usually it's meat pontificating about this shit.

356
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And I'll hear it from someone else.

357
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I talked to Ron Bloom from pod show last week,

358
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and,

359
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
you know, it was really interesting.

360
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I got a wide variety of reactions about him and pod show,

361
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
and some people still don't quite understand,

362
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
you know,

363
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
what pod show is about.

364
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So, I was wondering,

365
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
can you,

366
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
you know, you guys work closely with them?

367
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Can you describe,

368
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
you know,

369
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
what their, what your take on what they're doing?

370
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Well,

371
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I think that they are really,

372
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
truly developing the concept.

373
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I mean,

374
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
they're definitely at the forefront,

375
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
you know,

376
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
the pioneer.

377
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
They're pioneers,

378
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
you know,

379
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and I think they're really,

380
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
you know,

381
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
trading new territory.

382
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
No, wait a minute.

383
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
This is the two,

384
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
your own horn segment,

385
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
boiling.

386
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I think there will be copycat groups

387
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
that try to go and do the same thing with different.

388
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The pod show has gathered together shows

389
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
that are a vastly different group.

390
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And I think that in the future,

391
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
they'll probably be more,

392
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
little groups like pod show,

393
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
but they'll have a family friendly,

394
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
you know.

395
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Right.

396
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But we're a Christian network.

397
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Right.

398
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
For, you know,

399
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
gay and lesbian network, you know,

400
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
that kind of thing.

401
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Right.

402
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
In reality,

403
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I mean, I think what are the major things

404
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
that pod show is doing right now,

405
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
aside from putting together this network,

406
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
they're actually out there educating.

407
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
They're educating all the advertisers.

408
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
They're educating all of the advertisers

409
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and corporations,

410
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
and stuff about what pod casting is

411
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
and about how powerful this medium can be,

412
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
and actually is.

413
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And I think that,

414
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
there's,

415
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
there's a huge learning curve that's going on right now,

416
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and pod show is that the very forefront is that.

417
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
There are also the big reason why pod casting

418
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
is becoming so well known,

419
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
because they're out there in the right venues,

420
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
talking about it,

421
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
and getting the necessary media attention

422
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
that it means in order for it to grow.

423
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
The other thing I love about pod show

424
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
is that they developed their own music network

425
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
that is groups of unsigned musicians

426
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
that are able to get their music out there

427
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
through pod casting now.

428
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So that's the pod say.

429
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yeah.

430
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Right.

431
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And that's actually kind of a,

432
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
kind of a secondary revolution going on,

433
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
which, first pod casting is being very revolutionary

434
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and challenging, you know,

435
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
conventional media.

436
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But now you've got this pod say,

437
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
music network,

438
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
which is challenging the record industry.

439
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yeah, exactly.

440
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And I love it.

441
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And now we're having small music labels

442
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
sign up all of their artists

443
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
on to the pod say,

444
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
music network.

445
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Oh, I'll make it even better.

446
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
There's actually,

447
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I believe some big major labels

448
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
who are now silently releasing

449
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
some of their material onto the pod

450
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
safe music network.

451
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You'd have to go investigate for yourself,

452
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
see if you can find it in there.

453
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I've only heard it haven't,

454
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
haven't actually found it myself.

455
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
We're not challenging the record industry though.

456
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
We're rooting around it.

457
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That's exactly what we're doing.

458
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
We're just recreating a whole new infrastructure

459
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
outside of the traditional way of doing things.

460
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It is, you know,

461
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I got an email from SLOW.

462
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Of course,

463
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
responsible for the writing or the co-writing.

464
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Excuse me,

465
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
co-writing and production of the pod say

466
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
for peace of everyday were Christmas.

467
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Within,

468
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I guess it was done.

469
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What is it?

470
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The first week of December is when

471
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
that song was completed after a very short

472
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
production and turnaround time

473
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
with help from all these fantastic pod

474
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
safe music artists.

475
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Got it up and running.

476
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Obviously in time for Christmas,

477
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
but it was very, you know, a very timely piece of music.

478
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So it only had a lifespan for this year.

479
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And it'll come back every year,

480
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
at least it will on my show.

481
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You know, a very short lifespan

482
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
because after Christmas,

483
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
you know, you're just not going to play

484
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
many Christmas tunes.

485
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Over 300 pod cast played that song,

486
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Worldwide.

487
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That's astounding.

488
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's absolutely phenomenal.

489
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And, of course, sales

490
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
are all go to UNICEF.

491
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And I believe SLOW was working on the tally of the sales.

492
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You know, any track that was sold,

493
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
even if it was just one is,

494
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
is of course, fantastic.

495
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And we raised awareness.

496
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And we also had a good time while doing all this.

497
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So,

498
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
was anything else I was going to say about the pod

499
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
safe music?

500
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Oh, yeah.

501
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yesterday,

502
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I talked to my buddy Steve Leeds at Sirius.

503
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And you may be listening to this on your brand new

504
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
serious radio receiver.

505
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You got for Christmas.

506
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And there's some ideas about what we can do

507
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
with pod safe music and serious satellite.

508
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And in February,

509
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'll be in New York,

510
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and I'm going to meet with the head hunchos there

511
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
and see if we can get something going.

512
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So, yeah.

513
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Hmm.

514
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Ah, Friday.

515
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Let's see.

516
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Tomorrow's going to be just a chillout day here.

517
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Actually, I'm going to do some cleaning

518
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
because it's, again,

519
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I've only been here for a short week

520
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and it's amazing what a mess one guy can make.

521
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And that's the bummer about the, about this whole situation.

522
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You know, I've got,

523
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I've really got it all set up perfectly.

524
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You know,

525
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I've been married for 20 years and all of a sudden,

526
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
my wife says,

527
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Hey, you know, once you go,

528
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
go build your own little oil rig there

529
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and you can have your bachelor pad

530
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and you can work real hard

531
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
and then come back after a couple of weeks

532
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and then play real hard with us

533
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
with her,

534
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and of course with our daughter Christina.

535
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So, that's a,

536
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
that's just a beautiful thing,

537
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
a beautiful position to be in.

538
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Of course,

539
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
the downside is,

540
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I have this great bachelor pad

541
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and I can't have any girlfriends

542
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
to cook and clean for me.

543
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Hey, Adam, one will let you know

544
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
that no,

545
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
you do not need a dot mac account

546
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
for you to the eyewab or for the garage band.

547
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I finally gave up on the PC laptop.

548
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It failed several times

549
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
and ended up missing a couple of shows.

550
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So, I've moved everything over to the mac.

551
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm on a power book,

552
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
just like yours,

553
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
outdated a couple of months after it bought it.

554
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Yeah, I did it all in Garage Band last night

555
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
and pretty slick, not bad.

556
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
He worked in the same interface all the way across

557
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and let's you do a lot of things

558
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
that are specific to podcasting

559
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
and they didn't include quite a few loops

560
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
so you can have some fun with it.

561
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Check it out, number 28

562
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
at www.buckidrivetime.com

563
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
the most recent episode

564
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
if you want to hear one

565
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
that was put out with a grudman.

566
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Hi, buddy.

567
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Tom, thank you very much.

568
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
We'll definitely check it out.

569
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Talk to Drew last night, Don Andrew.

570
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I hadn't spoken to them in a while

571
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
just gave them a call

572
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
and they're still producing on Garage Band

573
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
and Drew's very excited about

574
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
giving this podcast studio a try.

575
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Although we did get them some equipment

576
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
because they're still basically working

577
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
on their original setup,

578
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
which is the USB microphone

579
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and Garage Band

580
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
and have not changed anything.

581
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So wait until they get some equipment

582
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
that they can play around

583
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
with and do some other things.

584
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Quite honestly,

585
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I definitely want to try it out.

586
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I will of course buy

587
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I-Life 2006 or I-Life06,

588
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
whatever it is.

589
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
But just looking at the demo

590
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
that Steve Jobs did,

591
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I don't know.

592
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I think that I'm just not a big fan

593
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
of having to look at tracks

594
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
while you're recording.

595
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm-I have a plan actually

596
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
that's kind of stuffed away

597
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
in my head.

598
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I want to create a piece of hardware.

599
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And of course,

600
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
you know, my father-in-law

601
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
not only is a very talented musician

602
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
but he can build anything

603
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
that he sets his mind to.

604
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
He built the whole podcast complex

605
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
at the cottage.

606
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
My entire studio set up.

607
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
But he's also really good

608
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
at putting together mixers.

609
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And I have an idea for this,

610
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
you know,

611
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
the perfect podcast

612
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
mixing console

613
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
that will work in conjunction

614
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
with software.

615
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Or it could work

616
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
completely independent of software.

617
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And next time I visit,

618
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I think I'm just going to sit down

619
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
where then we're going to

620
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
spec it out.

621
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And I know in him,

622
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
he'll put it together.

623
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And then if we have something

624
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
to put it into production,

625
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
that's usually the way these things are built.

626
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Because it really is not one mixer

627
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
or one piece of external gear

628
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
that really covers the entire gamut

629
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
of what I think you'd need,

630
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
or at least what I want

631
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
in order to create a podcast.

632
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Hey, those of you checking us out

633
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
on serious stars 103.

634
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
My satellite window is a closing.

635
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
We're going to continue here

636
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
on the podcast.

637
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
If you want to continue to listen,

638
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
we actually have a

639
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Trinity segment coming up

640
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
in just a couple of minutes.

641
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You'll have to go to dailysourceco.com

642
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
and, well,

643
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
gee, download the podcast.

644
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
But no worries,

645
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
just stay right where you are

646
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
because Pacific Coast

647
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
hellways up next,

648
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
followed by yeast radio

649
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
with Madge Weinstein

650
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and Dawn Andrew

651
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
and all the rest

652
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
of the Friday festivities

653
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
here on Syria.

654
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So I'll see you guys

655
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
on Monday,

656
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
have yourself a great weekend

657
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
and enjoy

658
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
riding the hellway.

659
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And for those of you

660
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
hanging out here,

661
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
let's see.

662
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
As I said,

663
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Trinity coming up.

664
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And that is one of

665
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
my projects

666
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
that I'm working here

667
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
on here.

668
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Actually, so I was able to tell

669
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
big mic yesterday

670
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
that I kind of

671
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
come up with a deal

672
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
with just two.

673
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And the deal is

674
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
if I can get Mike to move

675
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
his drum kit out of their

676
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
garage, so Sue can park

677
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
her car.

678
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
She'll let me set up

679
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
my little biodiesel

680
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
refinery.

681
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Mike was not happy

682
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
with this.

683
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Hi Adam.

684
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
This is Len from the Flying Pilot

685
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
podcast.

686
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And I wanted to put

687
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
to rest this idea of

688
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
small computer-based

689
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
flight simulators.

690
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
First,

691
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
in whatever flavor you have,

692
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
X plane,

693
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Microsoft Flight Simulator

694
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
or others,

695
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
these programs are

696
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
great for instrument

697
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
practice and instrument

698
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
proficiency.

699
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You can practice

700
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
procedures for holding

701
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
patterns,

702
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
missed approaches,

703
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
and route navigation,

704
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
and your instrument

705
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
cross-check

706
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
while you're doing vertical

707
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
losses, and both

708
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
shallow and steep bank

709
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
terms.

710
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Sort of a homework study tool.

711
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Since I did most

712
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
of my training

713
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
well before these

714
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
personal computer-based

715
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
programs were available,

716
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I pretty much had

717
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
to resort to

718
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
chair flying.

719
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I don't know if you

720
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
ever did this, but

721
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I did it sitting

722
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
at home on a toilet

723
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
with a toilet

724
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
plunger acting as my

725
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
control stick,

726
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
mentally going through

727
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
the next day's lessons.

728
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Now,

729
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
about logging time

730
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
in the simulator,

731
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
the FAA

732
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
has addressed this

733
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
frequent question

734
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
in their advisory

735
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
circular AC

736
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
61-126 entitled

737
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
qualification

738
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
and approval

739
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
of personal computer-based

740
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
aviation training devices.

741
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
The circular was

742
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
published on May 12, 1997.

743
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It's 11 pages long

744
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
with the last

745
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
seven pages detailing

746
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
the device qualifications

747
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
and the PDF is available

748
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
on the web.

749
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Basically,

750
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
as far as logging

751
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
the flight time,

752
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
it says

753
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
yes,

754
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
but

755
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
you can log up

756
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
to 10 hours

757
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
of dual instrument time

758
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
with a qualified instructor

759
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
if the simulator

760
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
meets the criteria

761
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
in the circular.

762
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Since all modern

763
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
flight simulation programs

764
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
meet or exceed

765
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
the 1997 software

766
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
and display requirements

767
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
in the circular,

768
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
your focus

769
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
should be on the hardware requirements,

770
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
which include about

771
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
15 different physical

772
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
control inputs,

773
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
and these

774
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
specifically can't be

775
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
substituted

776
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
with the keyboard or the mouse.

777
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
The whole package

778
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
must be approved

779
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
by the FAA

780
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
with your request

781
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
submitted a minimum of 60 days

782
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
before it scheduled use.

783
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I hope that this

784
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
finally clears up

785
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
anything having to do

786
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
with these

787
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
PC-based

788
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
simulators.

789
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And of course,

790
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
here's my plugin.

791
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You can visit

792
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
my website

793
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
at flyingpilot.com.

794
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Thanks, Adam,

795
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
and keep up

796
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
the instrument training

797
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
and practice.

798
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Yeah,

799
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
thank you very much, Len.

800
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Yeah, I think that

801
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
so besides the oil

802
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
refined,

803
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
the biodiesel refinery,

804
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I really want to

805
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
create a beautiful

806
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
flight sim

807
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
for the condo here

808
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
because the time

809
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
out here in San Francisco

810
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
of course cuts into

811
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
any flying time

812
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
because I'm

813
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
four and a half thousand

814
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
miles away

815
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
from my aircraft.

816
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And I think that

817
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
what I'm going to go with

818
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
is definitely

819
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
with X plane

820
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
and going to hook up

821
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
you know,

822
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
the 12 required

823
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
devices.

824
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Of course,

825
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I'm not going to

826
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
submit and try and get

827
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
FAA approval.

828
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I don't think that's going to be

829
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
worth it.

830
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It'll just give me,

831
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
you know,

832
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I don't need to log the

833
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
simulator time.

834
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I really just want to

835
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
be practicing and practicing

836
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
as much as possible.

837
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And there's always

838
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
an hour to every single day.

839
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Just want to plan it

840
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
so I can spend one hour

841
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
a day

842
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
at the refinery,

843
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
one hour day

844
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
in the gym here

845
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
at the condo,

846
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
which I have yet to do

847
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
this week.

848
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And then one hour

849
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
on the flight sim.

850
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Now is

851
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
that a life

852
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
or what?

853
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Isn't that just perfect?

854
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
When

855
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I was going to say

856
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
something about that

857
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I can't remember.

858
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm a little fuzzy.

859
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You know,

860
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I'm still having to

861
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
get up really early to do

862
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
these shows out here

863
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
on the west coast

864
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
because I'm so behind

865
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
you know,

866
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
let's hit it anyway.

867
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And I come on everybody

868
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
sing along.

869
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You know the words

870
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
by now.

871
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
All about that

872
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
bio diesel industry.

873
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Trinity.

874
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Trinity.

875
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
The quintessential luxury.

876
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Oh.

877
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Trinity.

878
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Trinity.

879
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
From the bio diesel industry.

880
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Yep.

881
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Oh.

882
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So yesterday,

883
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I took Trinity

884
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
to the gas station,

885
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
nearby.

886
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Because she's been shifting a little bit

887
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
rough.

888
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Now,

889
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I had a Rolls Royce silver shadow

890
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
too

891
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
in the early 90s,

892
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
which I drove to New York.

893
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
In fact, I drove that car

894
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
for 90,000 miles

895
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
drove to New York City every day.

896
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And it had,

897
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
interestingly enough,

898
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
it had a GM transmission,

899
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
which was kind of funny.

900
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
But sometimes it would

901
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
display the same type of

902
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
shifting behavior

903
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
that the Trinity is doing now.

904
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And usually

905
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
it would mean it just

906
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
would be a bit of transmission fluid.

907
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I'd say this thing is

908
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
topped up all fluids

909
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
or in place.

910
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So it must be something.

911
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It's probably the,

912
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I think it works

913
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
with like some kind of

914
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
banding system or

915
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
definitely need to

916
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
check her into a garage

917
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
one of these days to

918
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
make sure that that

919
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
doesn't get worse.

920
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And maybe a wash.

921
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I'm looking for a

922
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
a car detailer.

923
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And then

924
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
midweek.

925
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I'm thinking around

926
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Wednesday,

927
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
we're going to head off to

928
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
the bio diesel,

929
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
the Berkeley bio diesel

930
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
oasis to do our first

931
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
fill up.

932
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And that, of course,

933
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
will be a sound seeing

934
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
to our

935
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
and it got some audio

936
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
feedback today.

937
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Hey, Adam,

938
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
it's Peter Jarros from

939
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Jesus on the radio.

940
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I'm sending you this note

941
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
to explain a very

942
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
important point

943
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
once and for all.

944
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
There is

945
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
no such thing

946
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
as a bio diesel

947
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
engine.

948
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
They just

949
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
isn't.

950
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Bio diesel is a diesel fuel.

951
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It'll run

952
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
in any diesel engine.

953
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
The sole difference

954
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
between a bio diesel car

955
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
and a petro diesel car

956
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
is what's in the tank.

957
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Nice.

958
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Here's the deal.

959
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Burning a fuel

960
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
made from petroleum oil

961
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
works.

962
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
But as you know,

963
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
the scarcity of oil

964
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
means that any

965
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
dependence on petroleum

966
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
makes the plot of mad

967
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
max seem

968
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
not so far fetched.

969
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Too bad

970
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
into

971
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
one man leaves.

972
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Plus,

973
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
it's just plain dirty.

974
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So

975
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
wouldn't it be

976
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
great to burn vegetable oil

977
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
instead?

978
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Much cleaner

979
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and you can grow it

980
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
in your own backyard.

981
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Now,

982
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
a diesel engine can burn

983
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
just about anything

984
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
combustible.

985
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
But there's a problem with

986
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
straight vegetable oil

987
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
or SBO.

988
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It's too thick.

989
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
They can burn

990
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
in a diesel engine

991
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
but it has to get hot

992
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
first.

993
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
That means

994
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
tricking out your engine

995
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
to heat up the oil

996
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and that's in SBO conversion.

997
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
That'll work.

998
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
But surely

999
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
there's a better way.

1000
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Well,

1001
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
of course you know

1002
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
there is.

1003
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Bio diesel.

1004
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
The trouble with SBO

1005
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
is that it's full of glycerol.

1006
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
You know how glycerinous thick?

1007
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Well, it's the glycerol

1008
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
in vegetable oil

1009
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
that makes it so viscous.

1010
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And the viscosity

1011
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
clogs up a normal diesel engine.

1012
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
So, what do we do?

1013
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
We take it out.

1014
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
See,

1015
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Veggie oil is basically

1016
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
triglycerides,

1017
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
which are glycerol molecules

1018
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
each sporting

1019
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
three fatty acids.

1020
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And then make a great name

1021
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
for a rapper.

1022
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Wouldn't it?

1023
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Fatty acid.

1024
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Yeah, I'd have to be one of those guys

1025
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
who doesn't really have his own career.

1026
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
So as always,

1027
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
rhapsody featuring fatty acids.

1028
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Kind of think of it.

1029
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Rhapsody is a much better rapper today.

1030
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yeah.

1031
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Anyhow, where was I?

1032
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Right.

1033
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
The fatty acids are still stuck to the glycerols.

1034
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
So,

1035
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
we do a little boonoo

1036
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
or, as a scientist,

1037
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
call it,

1038
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
transesterification.

1039
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Which means,

1040
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
we throw in some alcohols and lie.

1041
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
The lie

1042
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
breaks the triglycerides up,

1043
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
giving us glycerol

1044
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
and free fatty acids.

1045
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Then, the free fatty acids

1046
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
bind to the alcohol instead.

1047
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
The glycerol is a thick,

1048
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
goopy mess,

1049
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
but the alcohol fatty acid combo

1050
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
is a nice thin fuel,

1051
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
that we know,

1052
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
as bio diesel.

1053
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
So, what did I explain all that?

1054
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
To get across one simple point out of

1055
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
it takes some work to make SBO into bio diesel.

1056
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And the whole point of that process

1057
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
is to get it to run in an ordinary, unmodified engine,

1058
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
which is why,

1059
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
say,

1060
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
with me now,

1061
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
there is no such thing as a bio diesel engine.

1062
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I don't know what Trinity's previous owner did,

1063
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
but I assure you,

1064
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
she does not have a bio diesel conversion.

1065
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
She is a great car, though.

1066
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Take us for another ride sometime.

1067
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I'd love to hear a sound saying

1068
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
door the place where you fill her up.

1069
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
There's another reason for this note too,

1070
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and that's Tom Loyat.

1071
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Tom is one of the biggest names

1072
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
in American bio diesel,

1073
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
especially on the East Coast.

1074
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
He also happens to be my girlfriend's father.

1075
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
For a long time,

1076
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
he ran his own bio diesel shop

1077
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
and grabbed size building out back,

1078
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
until he hit two problems.

1079
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
First, his fuel was declared

1080
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
non-street legal until he had come up

1081
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
with some obscene amount of money

1082
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
to get it tested,

1083
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
and then his shop burned down.

1084
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And to make things worse,

1085
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
the government declared it an oil spill,

1086
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
even though it was just vegetable oil.

1087
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Figures.

1088
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
These days,

1089
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
he's a bio diesel distributor up here in the Northeast,

1090
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
but he's also a major bio diesel consultant.

1091
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
He would love nothing more

1092
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
than to help people set up their own little refineries.

1093
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
If you'd like me to put you in touch,

1094
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I'd be more than happy to do so.

1095
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
His website is over at yellowbioidiesill.com.

1096
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Hey, by the way,

1097
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I should mention that my show

1098
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
uses on the radio.

1099
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
He is a music show

1100
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
that has nothing to do with Jesus.

1101
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
He can find me,

1102
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
my co-host Sarah Cat.

1103
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It's a great tune to go for it.

1104
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Jesus on the radio.com.

1105
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Tailwinds my friend.

1106
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And free fatty acid.

1107
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
He didn't shoot nobody.

1108
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Bye.

1109
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Van, that's fantastic.

1110
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Well, okay,

1111
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
this is going to be a seminal audio comment.

1112
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
This is something that we're going to bring back once in a while,

1113
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
because what a fantastic explanation.

1114
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Now, I do know, indeed,

1115
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
that there is no such thing as a biodiesel engine.

1116
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
The only conversion that took place on Trinity

1117
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
because she's pre-1985 is the hoses,

1118
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
because that glisterole content,

1119
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
or the glisterole content of the biodiesel,

1120
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
can actually corrode or erode your rubber housing.

1121
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And so those have to be replaced

1122
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
if you have an older model car with older hoses.

1123
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And if you lift the hood on Trinity,

1124
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
and that's actually what I did take a picture of

1125
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
is, well, you see some nice, new spank and hoses.

1126
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And that's just so the biodiesel doesn't rot the hoses away.

1127
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And that's really cool.

1128
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
You know, I know that Ray Lane,

1129
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
one of our board of directors,

1130
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
you know, one of the big wheels

1131
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
at one of our investors,

1132
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Clienter Perkins,

1133
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
eat lissons at the show.

1134
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I think,

1135
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
oh, regularly,

1136
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
and sometimes I think he listens every single one.

1137
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
He has sent me some information about biodiesel before,

1138
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
and I have a feeling that they may have an investment

1139
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
or they may be considering an investment in some type of biodiesel.

1140
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
So I'm hoping that there be some way

1141
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
that we can bring our experiences

1142
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
and Trinity into their decision-making process.

1143
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And maybe we can do something really good

1144
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
with someone else's money.

1145
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
You know, that's always a lot of fun.

1146
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So yes, as I said next week,

1147
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
we will be doing that sound seeing tour

1148
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
or be heading off to the Berkeley biodiesel oasis

1149
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
to fill her up.

1150
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And once I have a spot,

1151
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
in order to my kit, my official biodiesel refinery.

1152
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
She could talk.

1153
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
You didn't have a thing.

1154
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I don't forget being in her tent.

1155
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
We're Trinity.

1156
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Trinity.

1157
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Yeah.

1158
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah.

1159
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Yeah, how's it?

1160
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And to wind it up for today,

1161
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
lots of emails from people who are having problems

1162
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
with iTunes,

1163
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
retrieving their podcasts.

1164
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Two emails and some theories here.

1165
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I just want to briefly stop and talk about this.

1166
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
James Prevay says this issue

1167
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
with how poorly iTunes downloads large files

1168
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
has been a problem for me

1169
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
since I registered my first RSS.

1170
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I used iPod 11 for the longest time

1171
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
and enjoyed the download recovery feature

1172
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
for some of the larger cast.

1173
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Yeah, that's if you like mess it up

1174
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
and then it doesn't go download the whole show again.

1175
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I had a number of Apple scripting issues

1176
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
between iPod and iTunes,

1177
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
but they were workable.

1178
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
When iTunes came out with the RSS feed manager,

1179
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I switched wholeheartedly.

1180
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
When I did that,

1181
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I should have sent out a mass apology

1182
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
to all the podcasts I was subscribed to

1183
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
because the amount of bandwidth

1184
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
and other people's money

1185
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
he says that was wasted during that time

1186
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
that I was using iTunes for subscriptions

1187
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
was embarrassing.

1188
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I would see DSC attempts to download

1189
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
up to 10 times a day,

1190
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
sometimes reaching close to completion

1191
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
only to start from the beginning of the file

1192
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
when a lost connection error would appear.

1193
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I have to admit that even though I was fully aware

1194
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
the bandwidth was not free,

1195
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I continued to use iTunes for feeds

1196
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
until the latest version of juice appeared.

1197
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I think the ISPs are doing something

1198
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
with large data transfers,

1199
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
but I don't think we can blame iTunes for it.

1200
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
We can, however, blame iTunes for not using

1201
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
download recovery for such large transfers.

1202
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I concur 100%.

1203
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Thing will be wise for podshow

1204
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
or any large file content.

1205
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Distributor to get a very good handle

1206
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
and how much bandwidth is wasted.

1207
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Oh, we know.

1208
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Believe me.

1209
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Until the last bits get to the client,

1210
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
every bit before has potentially been squandered,

1211
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
but still paid for it.

1212
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Yep.

1213
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
We're aware of those problems.

1214
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
We can see it in the log files

1215
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
because you get these partial downloads

1216
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
in your access and actually in your error log.

1217
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Pete Shannon, I think it is.

1218
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I add them the most likely

1219
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
reason that people are getting broken downloads

1220
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
within the same network segment.

1221
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And this is indeed something that we've detected.

1222
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It's probably some of the transparent

1223
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
caching hardware that's in place on the network.

1224
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I did an interview for one company

1225
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
or based in the UK.

1226
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
What their hardware does is redirect requests

1227
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
for files to the cache machine,

1228
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
which then makes the request to the outside world.

1229
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It's the ISP's attempt to reduce external peer-to-peer traffic.

1230
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
For some of the statistics the company built up,

1231
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
they determine that 60% of all internet traffic

1232
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
is peer-to-peer.

1233
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
As far as I know,

1234
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
there's no way of bypassing this cache of its in place.

1235
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Information about the ISPs will go

1236
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
a long way towards figuring out if this is the case or not,

1237
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
but it seems to be the most likely reason.

1238
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
The problem is that it's the first retrieval of data.

1239
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
The problem is that if the first retrieval of the data is incorrect,

1240
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
then everyone is messed up on the near side of the cache.

1241
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Ah, yes, of course.

1242
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Yeah, that is a problem.

1243
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And it's a problem that we're going to have to figure out

1244
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
network wide.

1245
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
But really, the only way to do that is

1246
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
is to complain to your ISP, I guess.

1247
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
But it's funny because I just,

1248
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
offhandedly mentioned it,

1249
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
and it seems that planning people really are having problems

1250
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
with the automatic download of their podcast.

1251
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And I also believe that most of it has to do with their,

1252
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
with the local ISP issues.

1253
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So keeping our eye on it for sure.

1254
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
What are we at now?

1255
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
We're at almost 40 minutes.

1256
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Let's play one more song.

1257
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Something I got off the Podsake Music Network, of course.

1258
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And let me just see if I can go to the page

1259
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
because I've actually, I think I've played them before.

1260
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
But it was a whole different genre.

1261
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So this is a Chrissy.

1262
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Yeah, that's right.

1263
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Chrissy.

1264
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm looking at a picture now.

1265
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Let's go to the, you know what?

1266
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I'm going to go to website.

1267
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
She looks really cute.

1268
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Let me see.

1269
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
What's your website?

1270
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
BostonFashionA Music.com.

1271
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Is that what's going to?

1272
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Oh, page underscore8.html.

1273
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Okay.

1274
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
So I think I played more of like a kind of a rock song

1275
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
from her last time.

1276
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
But this one showed up on the homepage of a

1277
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
PM and this morning while I was scouting for songs.

1278
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And it's completely different.

1279
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Yet completely enjoyable.

1280
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
He's the one that I love.

1281
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
The one that I need.

1282
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
The one that I love.

1283
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
He's the one that I love.

1284
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
The one that I need.

1285
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
The one that I love.

1286
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Come on.

1287
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1288
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,600
I don't think I have to tell you how pissed I up.

1289
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,720
How pissed off I am right now.

1290
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:02,520
This is the same Apple audio problem that is not being acknowledged by the company.

1291
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,280
This is why I have a Mac

1292
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,780
because it works well in Audio.

1293
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:14,820
I demand at least an acknowledgement and if possible, an explanation.

1294
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,680
It'sнитьl,

1295
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,200
and why I should buy anything else from Apple

1296
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:24,760
until you do that. That's just, that's the truth, okay? Just tell me that you're looking

1297
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,240
into it. Just telling me that would make me happy, okay? Because otherwise I'm gonna keep

1298
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,240
bitching about it.

1299
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:15,800
I just can't tell you how I know for you. My everything, me everything, my

1300
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:21,800
inspiration for every song I sing and what no one knows in life.

1301
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,800
I'm gonna give it to the world and that's just the way it is.

1302
00:42:50,800 --> 00:43:00,800
I'm gonna give it to the world and that's just the way it is.

1303
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:12,800
I'm gonna give it to the world and that's just the way it is.

1304
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:22,800
I'm gonna give it to the world and that's just the way it is.

1305
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:36,800
I'm gonna give it to the world and that's just the way it is.

1306
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:56,800
I'm gonna give it to the world and that's just the way it is.

1307
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:14,800
I'm beautiful was that, huh? Chris Jones as in Chrissy and he is.

1308
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,800
He's the one with a little bit of extra effects there. That hell was that.

1309
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:29,800
Stop. Stop. Stop already. One final thing before I go, I just read on my Gmail.

1310
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:37,800
An announcement that Blackberry is now going to be offering the Pocket Mac program for free.

1311
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:44,800
When you buy a new Blackberry, that's the program that allows you to sync up your Blackberry to your iCal

1312
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,800
and your address book and everything on your Macintosh, which is very cool.

1313
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:55,800
And I'm trying to set something up here, there we go.

1314
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,800
And there was also, they're putting together an agreement with Google.

1315
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:07,800
The first thing they'll be doing is, well actually they've already released the Google local, which if you haven't used that on your new Blackberry yet,

1316
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,800
my god man, you get Google maps and the satellite images and you get directions.

1317
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,800
I mean, I've actually used this thing for directions when I didn't have the Tom Tom going to the car.

1318
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:25,800
It's great. So a real Blackberry client for synchronizing your Blackberry with Gmail cannot be far off.

1319
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:31,800
It can't be far off. We're supposed to have a meeting with the Google team today, but I don't think I don't think that happened.

1320
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,800
So and the Google talk guys are going to be there.

1321
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:41,800
And I think the Gmail people as well. So if that, if it doesn't happen today, it'll happen next week and I'll definitely let you know about it.

1322
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,800
All right, everybody. Hey, listen, I had a good time this week.

1323
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,800
I believe that we're going to Atlanta Sunday afternoon.

1324
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,800
There's a couple companies in Atlanta.

1325
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,800
You can just think about that for a second and you'll figure out which ones they might be.

1326
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:03,800
We're meeting them on Monday, which is kind of weird because Monday I think is Martin Luther King day, but and particularly in Atlanta.

1327
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,800
They're not taking the day off at these companies.

1328
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:12,800
So I'll talk to you probably Monday night or Tuesday morning, one of the two.

1329
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,800
And you have yourself a fantastic weekend.

1330
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,800
Happyness and health, my friends. Bye-bye.

1331
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,800
Pot show the other white meat.
