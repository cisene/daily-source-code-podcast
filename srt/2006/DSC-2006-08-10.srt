It's Cali Lewis from Geek Brief TV.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I just listened to episode 1 of Shadow Falls and it scared me.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I know I'm the fearless leader and all, but there are things that get to me in this dinner.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm not sure I'll be able to sleep tonight.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Maybe never again.

Just business, everyone.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yes, special. What's going on?

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We have an idea to find a flyer object.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hold on a second.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What does it say on the object?

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Uh, or um, we're going to get a test.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
D-S-C-4-3-9.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It was $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm testing here's a battle curry.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Beyond the realm of space and time,

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I feel a shoe that down my spine

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Never felt like this before

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Am I only dreaming?

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
A million miles away tonight

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You'll never leave body next to mine

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Through your space I'm gonna fly

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
With you, never so feel your shoe

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm not true yet

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You're around this world

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000

You're a super natural girl

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You're a reason

You're a super natural girl

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're a super natural girl

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're a super natural girl

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:16,020
It's from London, he hates David Bowie, it's Jimmy Golding, yeah, shades of Bowie, they're

64
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:20,480
looking into his pots of music network profile page, influences John Lennon David Bowie,

65
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,720
New Young Led Zeppelin, Jeff Buckley, Ah-han, no shit.

66
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,880
Link to that song on the pot of music network from dailysourcecode.com.

67
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,280
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

68
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,000
Coming to you from the affluent subversory known as Gilford, where today it's in the 60s,

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,760
so low 60s probably I'd say, it's a chilly, overcast, and around 930 this morning, there

70
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,920
was a knock at the door.

71
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:50,120
I'm sorry, the buzzer actually rang, as shit, insert buzzer effect here, and there was a box

72
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,800
for addressed to Patricia standing right there on the doorstep, as City Link just sped off,

73
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,800
they just dropped it off, no signature required apparently, inside just a absolutely

74
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:11,800
stunningly beautiful bouquet of roses, and a card with no name on the card, unfortunately,

75
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,560
but there's some clues as to where it came from.

76
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,520
Here's what the card read, Patricia, happy anniversary, please forgive Adam, he asked me

77
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,720
to get these for you on your anniversary since he was going to be busy, and I got toasted

78
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:34,160
and forgot, it's all my fault that he got those horrible gas station flowers, whoever did

79
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,360
this, I love you.

80
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,560
Thank you, even though, of course, Patricia knew that that was on the card wasn't true,

81
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,800
even if there was a moment where I actually contemplated saying that I made it off, I'll

82
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,200
say, yeah, no, I wouldn't have done that, now what I have on, but it was nice, first

83
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,200
of all because she got the flowers, she deserved second of all because, she knows that

84
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,000
people are actually out there listening, and are interested in what she has to say and

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,120
how she feels about things, fantastic, very much appreciated.

86
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,080
So the UK is in an uproar this morning, news came that it, all the airports, I think

87
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,960
Heathrow is the main one, no hand baggage allowed on airplanes, there were, I guess, the

88
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,040
Scotland Yard and the SAS and whoever else were all hot on the trails of some quote-unquote

89
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:30,040
terrorist, terrorist organization who were planning to blow up planes flying from the UK

90
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,040
and planning to use liquid explosives.

91
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:40,120
So at the time of the making of this charlie, it's a quarter to one in the afternoon, no

92
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:46,600
other updates on that, but airplane traffic or all plane traffic is just severely crippled.

93
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,280
And for those of you who wrote to me and said, hey, what's the deal with your own plane?

94
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,640
There's no problem, obviously, I mean, they don't care if I'm going to blow up my own

95
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,640
plane.

96
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:01,160
I don't care if I should about that, so no, there's nothing extra going on there.

97
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,960
Maybe tonight I'll be able to see something on there.

98
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
What is that?

99
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,360
I'm subscribed to this very, I love this CNN podcast all in a second.

100
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,960
Let me just look at my collection here.

101
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,720
Yeah, reliable sources, you've got to check this out.

102
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,480
This is CNN kind of looking at itself about how mainstream media is reporting.

103
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,920
And of course, a lot of it is about the war right now.

104
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Very interesting.

105
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,080
I'll put a link to it.

106
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,960
You can subscribe to it in Potio Plus, of course.

107
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
And it's good.

108
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,160
It's like, I know it's like a 20 minute show, but I really like watching that.

109
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,480
And there's another one in case you missed it is another CNN video show.

110
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,040
And it just shows the most unbelievable pieces of video from that week.

111
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,480
It's kind of like a huge Fox news injection coming from CNN once a week.

112
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,480
Oh, yes, oh, it's not.

113
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,080
Oh, she's not here, so I can do this privately.

114
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,200
All right, Amy Mac, ask her size, me, baby.

115
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,000
Hey, Adam, Amy Mac, are you ready for day two of your as per size workout?

116
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,800
Yes, ma'am, the butt is running.

117
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,320
Today, we're going to be doing squats.

118
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,640
You remain standing this time.

119
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
All right.

120
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
Good, thank you.

121
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,520
Place your feet a little wider than shoulder width apart.

122
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,280
Make sure your toes are facing forward.

123
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,400
Forward, of course.

124
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,000
Now put your hands behind your head.

125
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,680
Make sure your elbows are out to the side.

126
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
Find my head behind.

127
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,040
Yeah.

128
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,680
Now you're going to squat like you're sitting down on a chair.

129
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,960
Ready, go, squat on, make sure you stick that booty back.

130
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,120
Yes, booty back to put your weight on your heels.

131
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
Oh, my heels.

132
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,240
Three, two, your head and chest, stop.

133
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,480
Yes, head and chest, stop.

134
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,560
Four, make sure your knees don't come over your toes.

135
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,560
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

136
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Five, good.

137
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,240
Really stick that booty back.

138
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,080
Yeah, it's back.

139
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,160
Six, booty all the way back to all the way.

140
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,880
Seven, eight, keep breathing.

141
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,080
Tell me what's going to be this long.

142
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,920
Nine.

143
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
Amy, Amy.

144
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,760
Ten.

145
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,600
Yes, please.

146
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,440
Only 10 more to go.

147
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,440
Watch.

148
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,720
Don't stop, I didn't give you a rest.

149
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,240
Oh, crap.

150
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,080
Keep going.

151
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,680
Keep squat, I'll talk.

So be with him.

157
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,800
It's for a good cause.

158
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,200
Have you seen his ass?

159
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,520
It should say like they're up.

160
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,360
Can I stop?

161
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,200
Can I stop?

162
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,680

Yes, okay, 20.

165
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,520
Oh, man.

166
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,200
Well, I kind of got lightheaded on that one.

167
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,840
Thanks, Amy Mack, and Patricia thinks she was well.

168

Let's see.

171
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,520
Oh, this is interesting.

172
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,920
Let me just read you this.

173
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,000
C.C. Chapman says that his wife's birthday is this weekend.

174
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,600
It's going to wish her a happy birthday on the podcast.

175
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,240
He thought it would be fun to have some other friends chip in as well.

176
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,280
Her name is Laura.

177
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,360
We were according Friday morning, if I get, I want to be to call in.

178
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,360
That's good.

179
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
I got no time for that.

180
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Laura.

181
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,160
Hey, it's Adam.

182
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,720
Happy birthday.

183
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,200
Thank you for letting us use C.C.

184
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Abuse, C.C.

185
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,720
Hope you have a great day weekend.

186
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,640
I've been using internet explorer a little bit these days.

187
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,440
I'm completely out of breath from the, quote, from the

188
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,880
ascercise squats.

189
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,280
Very interesting.

190
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,160
It's not as bad as I recall internet explorer being.

191
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,840
I've been kind of on Firefox for a couple of years now.

192
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,360
And I downloaded somehow.

193
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,600
When I, I did something to my window set up and then explore no longer existed.

194
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,520
And there were so many applications for some reason bypassing the default and

195
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,080
asking for explore to start up that I downloaded iE7, the beta version is pretty interesting.

196
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
Not bad.

197
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:50,520
It certainly does Ajax stuff very well.

198
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,800
Couple of, uh, wait a minute.

199
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
No, no, no.

200
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,920
I'm going to do this one first.

201
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,560
Yesterday we announced the winner of Patricia's panties in the guest, the, who I love

202
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,960
it, ladies name at the end of our de-gap insertion on all pod show podcast.

203
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,560
Rob Buston was the winner and has this to say about his fabulous project.

204
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,880
Hey Adam, it's Rob us then the winner of the latest contest to guess the identity of

205
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,720
the I love it girl at the end of the pod show promo.

206
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,560
Yeah, um, well, that sounds like a great prize.

207
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,960
My wife might not like my getting another woman's panties in the mail.

208
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,000
I mean, you know, why just get like that sometimes I can put them on my head over my

209
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,800
ears while I listen to the podcast that you want to push it on or is that to weird?

210
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
But all right, I don't know.

211
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,800
I mean, don't ever think that giving iPods away is a bad thing.

212
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
All right.

213
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,640
I give a podcast, by the way, I'm the host of the of the jersey jam cast, which is on

214
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,440
pod show at jersey jamcast.pot show.com, I'm Buds with jersey Todd, a jersey guys got

215
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,440
a stick together.

216
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,440
You know what I mean?

217
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,440
Yeah, I know what you mean.

218
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,440
My brother.

219
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
My brother.

220
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,520
I don't want to meet my brother, but I've never heard ever in my life.

221
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,440
And I lived in jersey for quite a while, never once did I hear a jersey boy turned

222
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,480
down a pair of panties, but if you want me to send you something else, I'll think about

223
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,480
it.

224
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,120
Oh, I'll get jostle on the case.

225
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,720
She's been really good at sending out the prizes.

226
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:20,520
I got like, you know, prize package people now to send stuff out and came up with an idea

227
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,120
about Angie B of the chill cast.

228
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,200
And of course, I love spirals and I had to do a kind of a soap opera.

229
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,000
And I dragged Marc Yoshimo to name call from pod show LA into it and he totally jumped

230
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
on board.

231
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,640
He said, OK, this is great.

232
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
We're going to get it going.

233
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,760
It's going to be total soap opera.

234
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,280
So real Wayne and Wanda stuff.

235
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,440
And I think that we're going to let you determine the storyline.

236
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,640
But it's supposed to be hot and steamy.

237
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,200
And I guess we'll do it once a week or whatever we can and I'd ask, of course, Angie, if

238
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
she wanted to participate.

239
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,760
At a long time, no talk, huh?

240
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,240
Yeah, I'm totally down for the idea of you and I doing a podcast together.

241
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,560
Angie, I just want to make sure you completely understand it's not a podcast.

242
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,040
It is a hot steamy audio soap opera.

243
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,360
Just want to make sure you understand.

244
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,600
Be great to work with you a little bit more one-on-one.

245
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,840
By the way, I sent Petrition email.

246
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:20,080
I think, you know, it is high time that you came back to the show and changed the subject

247
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,360
away from folding versus scrunching.

248
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,080
Please, I don't think I can take any more of that.

249
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,640
Anyway, talk to you soon.

250
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,640
Looking forward to an Angie B. That's for show.

251
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:42,080
Got a couple comments about my Pito suckage for those of you who missed it over the

252
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:50,040
past weekend was flying my airspeed indicator malfunction and it's a pressure or

253
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,440
ram air pressure, kind of mechanical system, this Pito tube stuff and it's that little

254
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,000
thing that sticks out of the side of every single aircraft, even on the big 747s that

255
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,280
happen right up there near the nose and they kind of look like, they look like machine

256
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:12,760
gun actually and so the thinking was that a bug had crawled up in there and it blocked

257
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,080
the entry to the Pito tube and here's what's interesting.

258
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,800
The advice I received, I'll tell you from whom in a second, was to see if I could suck

259
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:27,440
anything out of there, if there was a bug that had crawled in, try to suck it out.

260
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,640
Boy, did the aviators amongst us respond?

261
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:38,240
Hey, I'm Mr. Rubbin calling another topic at all on my way to Mexico, I thought about

262
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,440
your Pito tube problem, here's where it comes to mind, first off I don't want to end

263
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,640
up sucking or blowing on any Pito tube and first if you're going to do it, you really

264
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:56,120
got to watch out, make sure you don't have the Pito tube heat on, actually it had been

265
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,440
on, this is one of the things I thought was wrong with it, so this thing that this stick

266
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,960
that's up in the air, if you're flying up at altitude, ice will form in it and then it

267
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:10,040
will get blocked too, so you have a heater and it literally heats up this metal tube.

268
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,800
So before I started to suck, I did just test and boy, it was extremely hot, you're

269
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,760
right, do not approach a Pito tube, you don't know.

270
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:25,960
I'm here on your lips, number two, like any analopido tubes, do you really know all the

271
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:31,760
places that Pito tube has been number three?

272
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:38,560
That Pito tube is connected to some really sensitive devices, like all Pito tubes, so

273
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,840
I have a calibrated sucked, you could do some damage.

274
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,000
I've been working on my calibrated sucked, my friend.

275
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:56,160
Now, the actor at potshow.com, that interview is awesome, Ellie Schriner, it's really cool,

276
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,840
some people beside the Eagles, he's on Van Morrison and a whole bunch of other stars.

277
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,840
Yeah, what Robin's talking about here is the target cast that lives at Akira.podshow.com.

278
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,840
I know I plug in this, I'm sure he'll tell us in a second.

279
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,840
Well, it's really cool.

280
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:17,360
He's re-cutting a whole bunch of these older songs, but he's going in surround sound, so

281
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,800
he's trying to push the DVD, set up for 5.1 surround sound, and that's what that

282
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,800
whole RDX at Akira is set up for surround sound.

283
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,680
He was part of the design team, and then also tuned it to the car, I think it's really

284
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,680
cool.

285
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,680
Why do I know so much?

286
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,600
Because I know the interviewer, she's really hot, and I have naked pictures.

287
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Oh, I stopped right there.

288
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
You got naked pictures?

289
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Sorry, you can't have.

290
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,400
Oh, man, I'll send you naked pictures of my wife?

291
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
No problem.

292
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Just Google Patricia 5, right there.

293
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
She's my wife.

294
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Suzanne.

295
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
Check her out.

296
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,520
InsideWorks.com, that's I.N.S.

297
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,240
Y.T.W.O.R.F.

298
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,240
That's Suzanne.

299
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,240
Ben, I work.

300
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,240
Hello.

301
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
Bill.

302
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,240
Ben.

303
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,240
Of course.

304
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,240
You're an aviator.

305
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,440
Well, that's not true.

306
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,240
Not all aviators or folders.

307
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:13,720
So when this air speed indicator problem occurred, I called Wing Commander William, who

308
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,840
does my maintenance.

309
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,440
And this is exactly what he suggested.

310
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,960
He said, well, suck on it.

311
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,360
See, you can get anything out of there.

312
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,200
I said, if it's further than the P2 to itself, then we'll have to blow out the whole

313
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
system.

314
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,800
And indeed, that is a multi-day job.

315
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Now, as we all know, it turned out that due to my previous bumpy landing, we'd have to

316
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,120
call almost a hard landing.

317
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,240
Although Patricia didn't complain, so I wasn't all that bad.

318
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,800
The actual indicator had got stuck on the needle stop at the 12 o'clock position.

319
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:52,320
Just stuck one hair, because, you know, basically when you land you're done at zero

320
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,800
feet, it should be zero feet if everything's calibrated properly.

321
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,640
And so then that bounce probably got it stuck.

322
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,720
But oh boy, there were more aviators checking in on this.

323
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,720
Yeah, I had them.

324
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,200
This is Peter, a listener from Australia.

325
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,280
You'd probably call me an aircraft mechanic, they're Australian Air Force, called me

326
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,040
an avionic technician.

327
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:21,520
In DSC436, you described how you were trying to clear the P2 probe of the Delta Sierra

328
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,080
by sucking on the end of it.

329
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,600
If you're sucking on the end of a P2 probe, you obviously have no idea of how delicate

330
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:36,960
the interior components of your airspeed indicator are, please, please, if you think

331
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,560
your P2 probe is blocked, get an aircraft mechanic to have a look at it, those instruments

332
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,560
need to be disconnected and system cleaned out carefully.

333
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,560
Please don't do that.

334
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,560
I would really like to keep on hearing for you.

335
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,120
If you are not blowing in the deal for here and something goes wrong, then I'd be going

336
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,120
to happen.

337
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,520
I do, of course, I completely agree maintenance is everything.

338
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,720
And I'm a little freaked out about it, because I'm definitely going to call the wing

339
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,160
commander now, because he without a doubt told me that it was okay to suck on the P2 too.

340
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:16,680
I think when he t-shirts now, you know, don't just suck on any P2 tube, do you know

341
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,680
where it has been?

342
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,680
I had him.

343
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,560
Is this Michelle from Mr. Perl's?

344
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,280
Oh, man, guys, if you've never listened to whispered pearls, you've got to listen to

345
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
this podcast.

346
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,280
If you want to hear women talking openly about feelings, F screw the feelings about

347
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,320
sex, this is the podcast for you.

348
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:41,080
I, you know, I've been hearing a lot of guys in your podcast recently.

349
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,280
Oh, I know.

350
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:50,520
I know way too many guys talking about war and talking about soccer and

351
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,600
talking about that toilet paper thing that we're not going to go into.

352
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:03,720
And I haven't been hearing a whole lot of women other than your wonderful wife Patricia.

353
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:12,520
So I thought I'd send you a comment, because, you know, we, the girls of whispered pearls

354
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,080
always strive to give a man what he yearns for.

355
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
Oh, yeah.

356
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,880
Thank you for that comment about the podcast, Expo.

357
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,880
What's up with that?

358
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,880
No sex thing.

359
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,520
Yeah, that is kind of funky.

360
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:31,160
No sex podcast allowed at the Expo, at least no panel required.

361
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,920
I love your voice, Michelle.

362
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,360
Well, I hope you go.

363
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,160
And I hope I see you there.

364
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,760
There was so much fun to be had by the pool last time.

365
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,760
And what was this I heard you say somewhere in there about liking orgies?

366
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
I don't know.

367
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,120
I think that was just a fever dream I was having.

368
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,600
So this is Michelle signing off from whisper pearls.

369
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,320
Oh, Michelle, thank you.

370
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,000
And thank you so much for the picture of your sister.

371
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,800
I mean, how great is this?

372
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,640
Michelle sends me this really sexy comment and then sends me a semi-nude picture of her

373
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,640
sister.

374
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,960
Oh, you know how to make an old man smile.

375
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,920
I appreciate it.

376
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:20,880
First male numbers, programming in your phone right now, plus one, two, zero, one,

377
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,080
six, two, five, six, three, five, seven.

378
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,960
You can reach me anytime through that number.

379
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,520
If you're in the UK, you want to use our London number.

380
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
There's no problem.

381
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,960
Oh, two, zero, seven, six, eight, one, three, seven, five, three.

382
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,960
Yeah, because we're bad.

383
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
We're nationwide.

384
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
We're international.

385
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,360
We got phone numbers in Jersey and London.

386
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,760
It's almost the same kind of place.

387
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,280
I heard my sister's Willow's podcast.

388
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,560
She did another, from the Hills of Florence, which I've pointed to before.

389
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,400
And now, my nephew, her son, that's my nephew, right, her son.

390
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,240
Who I think is, how does Mateo now?

391
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,480
He's 37, right, you know, I should let you hear this, hold on a second.

392
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,160
This will freak you out.

393
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,520
He's really, really, really sweet.

394
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Let me see, the name of his podcast is the Pacino podcast.

395
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,560
So it's patino.ponsio.com, let me see, did I get that right?

396
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Yeah.

397
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,600
His last name is Paci.

398
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,600
So that makes kind of sense that we came up with the patino.

399
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,640
But he heard his mom, my sister, Doopodcast, and now he's completely crazy about doing

400
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,640
podcasts.

401
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,520
And it's like, every day, he's like, Mom, Mom, Mom, we have to do another podcast.

402
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,520
And it's not necessarily the podcast that he likes.

403
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,480
He really loves the whole, uh, pod save music aspect of it.

404
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,360
Let me just let you hear a little bit of his, it's just too cute for words, a little bit

405
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,160
of his podcast.

406
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,160
See what happened.

407
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,160
Did, what?

408
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
Oh, here we go.

409
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,160
I play it.

410
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,160
He'll love this.

411
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,160
He has the cute.

412
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,400
I don't even know what he could be saying that is all.

413
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,080
Hey, this is Dan Patterson from the Creepy Sleepy Show.

414
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,880
You want creepy without the sleepy?

415
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,720
Check out Shadow Falls, pod shows brand new audio drama series.

416
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,720
It's terrifying.

417
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
But don't.

418
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
Don't.

419
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
See.

420
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:12,720
Let's go.

421
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,480
Echo, soon on Mateo, soon on a different set.

422
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,280
But at the moment, soon on a set of things in Bahansa, I thought you were cool.

423
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,280
Can I get out soon?

424
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
Pudcast.

425
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
Pudcast.

426
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,280
I'm sorry, I'm not sure, so I'm going to make a call.

427
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,280
All right.

428
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,680
I wish anybody was saying, I'm sure Franco from Rockcast, Italy.

429
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,920
I would be very, very proud.

430
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,320
Play that Chubby Checker, but yes, today, if you were listening to Syria, satellite stars

431
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,720
102, then you didn't hear it.

432
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,320
I said, just go to dailysourceco.com, but it was this whole controversy about Chubby

433
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:49,920
Checker versus the original author and performer of the Twist Hang Ballard, PW Fenton,

434
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,040
sent this great piece in.

435
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,360
And so PW followed up with an email.

436
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,280
Hang Ballard told me they did try to screw him out of his royalties, but a copyright

437
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,840
search revealed he'd copyrighted the Twist Four Times.

438
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,000
He re-registered it every time he tweaked it.

439
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,400
As early as 1958, the court tell that his 1958 version was the source of the hit version

440
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,880
and Hank got all of the composer royalties, which is 50% of all royalties.

441
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,000
He had a comfortable life in Southern California, never retired though he kept performing

442
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,600
an oldie shows right up to his death in 2003.

443
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,080
That's cool, isn't it?

444
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,080
So he didn't get it.

445
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,480
I was so sure that he would have gotten screwed, but he had to go fight for it.

446
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,480
That's for sure.

447
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,040
Even though it was plain and simple and clear, he had to go fight for it.

448
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,920
Hopefully a lot of those days are over.

449
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,120
Cause boy, that's a day's suck.

450
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,360
Let me just see what's coming up on Syria Stars 102 for you.

451
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,240
Right after this show, the Daily Source Code, let's see, we have Pacific Coast Hellway, then

452
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,240
it's Dawn and Drew Soccer, Groll Incorporated, Coming Up, Digital Flotson, Email Girl

453
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,560
Talk, East Radio, we wind it up with Scott Seagler between 930 and 10 tonight, right

454
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,800
here on Syria Stars 102.

455
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,200
I'll see you guys back here tomorrow.

456
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,120
Everybody wave goodbye to the serious listeners.

457
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,560
Bye.

458
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,240
Of course, they miss all the good stuff, right?

459
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,240
Like the host.

460
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,320
Andrew Boyz, author of the agency, Sam Dwarr.

461
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,320
From the web kitchen in Belgium, this is the kitchen cast of the kitchen cast of the

462
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
kitchen cast.

463
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
Let's check that out.

464
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,040
Hey Adam, it's search from Belgium, I made a 34-year-old flash to call for a long time

465
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,400
Charlie listener, and I thought I'd give that podcasting thing to go myself.

466
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,000
So last night, I finished the pilot episode of the kitchen cast.

467
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,160
Now don't worry, it's not a cooking show, and I'm monthly juggling around with tomatoes

468
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,800
and spices and stuff.

469
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,880
It's a show about technology, about flash and stuff I find on the web.

470
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,240
So now I really need some listener feedback, so I invite you to go to kitchencastonpotchow.com

471
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,560
and let me know what you think.

472
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,560
Oh, and one-witting?

473
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
Yeah.

474
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,560
Fuller.

475
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,560
Yeah, of course.

476
00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:05,120
Thank you for listening, stay subscribed.

477
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,880
Welcome to the show.

478
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,760
I think it was about the morning when I woke up, there were 63 comments.

479
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,000
You know, everyone's a couple days behind, but we had a major de-gap problem where shows

480
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,640
we're stopping after the first 25 seconds of the podcast, not just daily source code,

481
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,920
but basically across the pod show, podcast delivery network.

482
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,680
Yes, it was a bug, and it's interesting how these bugs flow, and it's like, you may

483
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,000
hear one or two things from someone you think, well, you know, maybe that's specific to their

484
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,600
machine or they're set up, and then you get a couple more, and then before you know

485
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,240
it, this is avalanche, and what's interesting is we actually fixed the problem yesterday.

486
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:53,880
So I think everyone's DSC 438 was just played without any stopping, but the avalanche

487
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,680
of people calling in just continues, and I completely appreciate it.

488
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:02,760
I can't respond to everybody, so hopefully if you sent in a bug report, there was some

489
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,480
really good ones, you know, people sending in, all kinds of great, you know, data points

490
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,480
and information.

491
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,480
It's so cool to have you guys helping out debug this stuff.

492
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,000
We got it fixed.

493
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,640
Actually, he had to call Andrew Grummit, he was an exemplification, because the de-gap is kind

494
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:25,280
of his baby, and I would have to say, because of all the great information you gave us,

495
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,760
we were easy for us to track it down and stomp the bug.

496
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:34,960
Still took work, of course, but, and so too, have many, many people sent me the notice

497
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:41,400
that Durand-Dran is buying an island in second life, and going to be performing live.

498
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,400
Well, I think that's my cue.

499
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,440
I think when Durand-Dran shows up, it's time for me to leave.

500
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,080
Nothing against Durand-Dran.

501
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,840
I like the guys, I always like them music, but if you want to talk about 80s icons, that

502
00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:00,320
is definitely Durand-Dran is a true 80s icon, and I'd like to distance myself a little

503
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
bit from that.

504
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,400
I don't want to say, you know, it seems like second life is going to become a place

505
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:10,560
for washed up 80 superstars to gather, not don't want to be a part of that.

506
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:16,200
So I'm a little bit in flux, I know it, because I know what works and doesn't work

507
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,080
in second life, and you just can't build any sizable audience because the system can't

508
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,080
handle it.

509
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,640
So it just doesn't seem like it's really worth it.

510
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,640
It's fun.

511
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,200
Still like hanging out once and a while at the island, but now the Durand-Dranis have

512
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
moved in.

513
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,320
I think I'm going to have to cut out.

514
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,520
The Podshow ad challenge is closing.

515
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:44,160
We have, I think, 13 or 14 finalists, and in the next week and a half, we'll be playing

516
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,840
some of these finalists here on the daily source code on other Podshow podcasts as well

517
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:54,960
of course, and only one of them can win, but is all about creating the message yourself.

518
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,600
So instead of the company packaging all their information into a 30 second in your

519
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,200
face slot, take your time.

520
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,520
Come up with something interesting, something to listen to, something that might even

521
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,400
be considered content.

522
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,920
Is your computer a hacker magnet?

523
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,200
It won't be anymore, because Earthlinke is here to save the day.

524
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,200
Yes, it's worth it.

525
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,640
With downloads faster than speeding bullet, and firewall, it is more powerful than a

526
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,360
look on the motor.

527
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:33,600
It has an anti-virus system that cleanses your PC with the clickable mouse.

528
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
It's a blur.

529
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,600
It's a blur.

530
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,600
It's a blur.

531
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,600
It's Earthlinke.

532
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,000
Perfect internet from outer space that links to Earth, with powers and abilities far

533
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,840
greater than those of normal high speed, and prices solo that it will blow you out of

534
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,840
this world.

535
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:58,240
So make the right decision and turn to Earthlinke as your internet provider.

536
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,680
So if you win with that, I guess Michael Butler is going to get a PC or ass, huh?

537
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,480
For American Heartbreaks, last of the super heroes.

538
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
Interesting.

539
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,480
Hey, it's Miles.

540
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,480
And Steve from the strip podcast.

541
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,560
The past few months have been crazy for us.

542
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,400
We broke big news that Harris Bray was closing, and that Liza Manelli is coming to Vegas

543
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,200
to headline, and our interviews, as usual, produce several juicy nuggets.

544
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,840
Here's Andrew Lloyd Webber being caught off guard.

545
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,920
The name of the production here is not Phantom of the Opera.

546
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,920
It's Phantom.

547
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,720
So as big as spectacular.

548
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,160
It was that a decision that you made.

549
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,520
To be honest with you, you would lose the thing on this.

550
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,560
It was always a breed that was going to be Android with the center that is the Opera.

551
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,920
You lose me on that.

552
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,400
Then there was Joan Rivers offering up this defense of Star Jones.

553
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,480
She just jumped the gun.

554
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,880
They were going to give it a goodbye party.

555
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,640
They were going to make it a whole different thing.

556
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,640
And she's very smart.

557
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,920
They get it from getting fired.

558
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,240
I'll do it on my terms.

559
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,240
And don't let it look like this wonderful goodbye will miss you.

560
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,160
Let it look like what it is, which is your firing me.

561
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:06,440
And poker champ Chris Moneymaker, wondering something that has baffled Steven Me for years.

562
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,680
The people who just stand around watching live poker games, what do they watch it?

563
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,080
That's my biggest question.

564
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,640
My wife will pick him and watch me in the stands.

565
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,520
She tells me it's the most boring thing in the world.

566
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,560
Because I don't know if I want someone to call you or if I want them to hold.

567
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,960
I'm just in there watching nine guys sit around the table.

568
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,680
And coming in August, a very interesting interview with Chubby Checker.

569
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:33,400
Gladys Knight and possibly Steve Win, all that more at the strippodcast.com.

570
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,840
I really love that show.

571
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,640
It's so perfect, you know, because all these entertainers come to Vegas.

572
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,240
And I'm sure they're all thinking, ah, it's just some local little thing, you know.

573
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,160
But look at all the mileage we got out of the Chubby Checker interview.

574
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,240
And then the way PDA was able to come back with the hang valid story.

575
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,960
I'm just fascinating, absolutely fascinating.

576
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:58,480
And these guys, you know, they're so, what's the word I'm looking for?

577
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,840
You just want to open up to them.

578
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,840
You just want to, you know, tell them everything.

579
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:09,600
And their questioning is so direct yet, so innocent, almost.

580
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,360
But, you know, of course they're far from innocent.

581
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,680
It just sounds innocent, but the stuff they get out of these artists is fantastic.

582
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,680
Congratulations, guys.

583
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
Really like it.

584
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,680
Good job.

585
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:23,680
Hey, here's something we haven't done in a while.

586
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,760
But today is a very special day.

587
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,760
First let us sing along.

588
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,680
Chanty, chanty, quintessential luxury.

589
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:38,760
Oh, chanty, chanty, fucked by a diesel industry.

590
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,120
New to the Daily Source Code, Trinity is my Mercedes-Benz.

591
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:49,400
Eggnog Yellow, 300 turbo diesel station wagon, sitting in the parking garage of the

592
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
Curry condo.

593
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
It runs on biodiesel.

594
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,240
It's 100% biodiesel that I buy from biofueloasis in Berkeley.

595
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,400
And to celebrate, we actually, we've got something to celebrate because today is a very special

596
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
day.

597
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,400
Hi.

598
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,400
This is Matthew.

599
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,400
Hold on a second.

600
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
One of that.

601
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
Crap is that so soft.

602
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,400
Ah.

603
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,400
Come on.

604
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,400
Let's try it now.

605
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
Hi, Adam.

606
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,400
Hey.

607
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,400
Jamie here.

608
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
I'm Birmingham.

609
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,400
It's the wrong one.

610
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Ha ha ha.

611
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
Hold on.

612
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,080
I do something for yourself when I find this, really.

613
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:42,720
I swear, I got that can't find it.

614
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,720
I feel like a dick now.

615
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,720
You're probably sitting there going, but you are a dick.

616
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,720
No?

617
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,720
Okay.

618
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,720
Here we go.

619
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,720
Hi, Adam.

620
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,000
This is Matt Natillow, the Matt's today in history podcast.

621
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,400
August 10th is International Bio Diesel Day, commemorating the day in 1893 that Rudolf

622
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:22,160
Diesel's prototype engine, first ran under its own power.

623
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:27,520
Diesel was actually an early proponent of what we call today bio diesel.

624
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,720
He wanted his engines to run on vegetable oil, other locally produced fuels and even powdered

625
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,880
coal.

626
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:41,640
The idea of a petroleum-based product came about much later, so really we owe the genesis

627
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,720
of the bio diesel movement to him.

628
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:49,000
I know you're not in California this week, but I hope the next time you're in San Francisco,

629
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,120
you'll give Trinity a hug in commemoration of today.

630
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,120
That's it.

631
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:58,320
Now for the Shane's plug, max today in history.com or in iTunes.

632
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,320
Thanks, man.

633
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,320
Folder, scruncher?

634
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,720
Matt, thank you very much.

635
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,120
By the way, I am subscribed to your show.

636
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,120
There you go.

637
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,720
Today, International Bio Diesel Day.

638
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,720
Thank you so much, and...

639
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,720
Well, I would have, you know, it's no wonder I'm not nominated for Best Produce Podcast anymore.

640
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,720
I had a nice driving here from Birmingham.

641
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,720
26 years old.

642
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,720
No, not now.

643
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,720
Just 10, 27 years old.

644
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Okay.

645
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,720
And I am a self-rench here.

646
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,720
I was listening to the source code yesterday.

647
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,720
It's so four, three, six.

648
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,720
And there you have it.

649
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:56,720
All your cotton had a guy that's flown and I wanted one of his favorite musicians across.

650
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,720
And I think that's an absolutely amazing idea.

651
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,720
Okay, so he's referring to...

652
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,720
The guy who's bringing Jonathan Colton over to perform gigs here in the UK.

653
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,720
I guess you could call that classically.

654
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,720
You could call that a, like, a concert promoter or an impresario in an old fashion word.

655
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,720
This is something I would love to do to get the list of your speedies to come across the UK.

656
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,720
I mean, that would just be absolutely fantastic.

657
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,720
I'm sure there's not the other people that would love to see them get across.

658
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
You know, and come and watch them play live either here.

659
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,720
And I've got their album for all their DVDs.

660
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,720
I had, I mean, it would just be absolutely awesome to, you know,

661
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,720
they haven't come across somewhere in the UK and show up to go and watch them.

662
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,720
You're going to be absolutely brilliant.

663
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Okay, man.

664
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,720
Well, I'd love to show you because of the good work.

665
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,720
And I'm a folder.

666
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,720
Of course you are.

667
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
You're brilliant.

668
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,720
Yeah.

669
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:55,720
Well, this is what we classically would call an impresario or an agent.

670
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,720
I guess you would call it or a concert promoter.

671
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,720
And I totally agree.

672
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,720
I think the bitties would kill over here.

673
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,720
This is exactly why I want a, I want you to be able to have a multiple,

674
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,720
you know, you have multiple personalities, multiple assets and pod show plus.

675
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,720
You can see it in action at podshow.com.

676
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,720
So you have your own identity, like I'm adam.podshow.com.

677
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,720
And then underneath that, I have the daily source code.

678
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,720
I should also be able to be a venue if I happen to have a big backyard, you know.

679
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,720
And then that way, think about all the cool connections we could make to actually make that happen.

680
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,720
I think they would kill.

681
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,720
You're absolutely right.

682
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,720
And of course, your wish is my command.

683
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,720
And this is no shit.

684
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:43,720
Right after your voice mail comment, this is the next one that came in on 2016256357.

685
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,720
Actually, she may have called the London number, a mandemonico of the bitties.

686
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,720
Hey Adam, it's a mandemonico for bitties.

687
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,720
I'm not sure I have the right number for you.

688
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,720
So instead of calling my personal line, she called the voice mail line.

689
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,720
So this is a personal message.

690
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,720
Yes, I do.

691
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,720
I'd share what you know in London.

692
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,720
And did you hear that?

693
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,720
Did you hear the voice inflection?

694
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,720
Did you hear that?

695
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,720
That sounded like a big invitation.

696
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,720
Listen.

697
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,720
London.

698
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,720
Well, I got you on here this.

699
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
But I do.

700
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,720
I'd share what you know in London.

701
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,720
I'm in London.

702
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,720
Come visit me.

703
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,720
And I'm staying at my sisters.

704
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,720
Oh, okay.

705
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,720
And she almost muffled the way to stay at my, staying at my sisters.

706
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,720
Instead of covering gardens, darling.

707
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,720
I'm just wondering if you were going to be around on Sunday.

708
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,720
I'm not really on email at all.

709
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
Not on email at all.

710
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,720
But my phone number.

711
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,720
Yeah, okay.

712
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,720
So I'll just turn the phone number down for a second.

713
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,720
That's a bummer.

714
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,720
She's not on email.

715
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,720
Yeah.

716
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,720
So let me know.

717
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,720
You can get together.

718
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,720
We can see her.

719
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
Oh, man.

720
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,720
Tomorrow's Friday.

721
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,720
If so much to do.

722
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,720
I'd love to go hang out with Amanda.

723
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,720
I've no idea what she's doing in London either.

724
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,720
I should go.

725
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
Get any of you.

726
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,720
Hold on.

727
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,720
Who's that?

728
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,720
Someone.

729
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,720
Someone in the blackberry.

730
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,720
It's probably Amanda Monaco.

731
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,720
Let's see.

732
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,720
What is this?

733
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,720
Oh, no.

734
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,720
Unrelated.

735
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,720
But of course, all of this brought me to the conclusions that, yes, indeed.

736
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,720
Need to play more biddies, man.

737
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,720
Haven't heard the girl for a while on the Charlie.

738
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,720
This has to be one of my favorite songs they've done and probably one of my favorite songs

739
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,720
of all time.

740
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:34,720
Let's see these biddies from New York and a hell of a boy.

741
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:44,720
It's not like he doesn't know just what to say to make you feel right.

742
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,720
Stay up nice.

743
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,720
Think of him all day.

744
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,720
Well, his song is true.

745
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:07,720
But his head keeps getting in the way.

746
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:15,720
Now it's not like he's got a nasty disposition.

747
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,720
He wants to keep you locked up tight.

748
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,720
Knocked up right.

749
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,720
Barefoot in the kitchen.

750
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,720
He's a hell of a boy.

751
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,720
Only.

752
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,720
Only half of a man.

753
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,720
No, it's not like.

754
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,720
The boys are bad days.

755
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:54,720
Born on the wrong side of town, under the wrong road.

756
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,720
On the wrong day.

757
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,720
He's a hell of a boy.

758
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,720
But only.

759
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,720
Only half of a man.

760
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:19,720
Just what do you think you will get if you persist thinking.

761
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,720
This is the best you can do.

762
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,720
Say no to your life girl.

763
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,720
I'll be fine.

764
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,720
You know it.

765
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,720
Your life's gonna say no to you.

766
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,720
Easy call.

767
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,720
Easy call.

768
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,720
Life's too short to live it.

769
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,720
So.

770
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,720
No, it's not like.

771
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,720
It's more than you can say.

772
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,720
Do have that pretty boy.

773
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,720
Sit and next to you.

774
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,720
Listen to you.

775
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,720
Hold in your hand.

776
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,720
He's a hell of a boy.

777
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,720
But only.

778
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,720
Only half of a man.

779
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,720
I like it, I like it, I like it.

780
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,720
He's a hell of a boy.

781
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,720
But only.

782
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,720
Only half of a man.

783
00:42:32,720 --> 00:43:02,720
I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I

784
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:20,480
like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like the guitar, I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it,
