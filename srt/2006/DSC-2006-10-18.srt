3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,560
First thing that Brisco did that impressed us was, we're not only to come in and really read the dialogue well as an actor,

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,720
but he also did a standing flip in our office.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,640

This is a true heart and story of the boy they called Adam Curry.

00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,360
And they're so excited about it.

11
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,160
I'm so incredibly happy.

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,160
It was great, didn't even take a taxi.

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,160

I want to hear this

22
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,160
It's easy, I want to keep falling on my head

23
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,160
If they keep falling, they're good

24
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,160
I want to hear this

25
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,160
I want to hear this

26
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,160

I want to hear this

35
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,160
We're that

36
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,160
I don't want to hear this

37
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,160

00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,160
I don't want to hear this

44
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,160
I don't want to hear this

45
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,160
Okay

46
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,160
I don't want to hear this

47
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:56,160
I really don't like this

48
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,160
I really don't like this

49
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:06,160
I love a wake-up

50
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:12,160
I really don't like this

51
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,160
I really don't like this

52
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,160
I've got to wake up

53
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,160
I really don't like this

54
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,160
I really don't like this

55
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,160
I love a wake-up

56
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,160
I really don't like this

57
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,160
I really don't like this

58
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,160
I really don't like this

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,160
I really don't like this

60
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,160
I really don't like this

61
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,160
I really don't like this

62
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,160
I don't like this

63
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
I really don't like this

64
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,160
I really don't like this

65
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,160
I really don't like this

66
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,160
I really don't like this

67
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,160
I really don't like this

68
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,160
I really don't like this

69
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,160
I really don't like this

70
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:47,160
I really don't like this

71
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,160
I really don't like this

72
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,160
I really don't like this

73
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:07,160
I really don't like this

74
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,160
I really don't like this

75
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:19,160
I really don't like this

76
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,160
I really don't like this

77
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,160
I really don't like this

78
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:35,160
I really don't like this

79
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:47,160
It's been a while since I played the space rocks you've fallen on my head.

80
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,160
It turns out that I've got a few new songs out there as well.

81
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,160
Hey everybody, how are you doing? Welcome to the Daily Source Code.

82
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,160
We are back again in a beautiful sunny Northern California at the Curry condo.

83
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,160
Hey yeah, how you doing? I love the song.

84
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,160
You know, go ahead, come up with it, really.

85
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,160
Space rocks keep falling on my head.

86
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,160
Away with the ferries.

87
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,160
Away with the ferries, type of that one.

88
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,160
Apologies for yesterday, lack of a showage.

89
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,160
I have been so incredibly sick.

90
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,160
New York was completely different than I had imagined.

91
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,160
Everything I wanted to do turned out differently.

92
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,160
And that's just because crap, man.

93
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,160
It happens once a year to me and I get the flu or whatever it is or whatever the heck I picked up.

94
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,160
It must have been something I picked up on the flight over from London.

95
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,160
And I didn't get to see David Palito.

96
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:59,160
There was a couple other people in New York that I was looking forward to hanging out with or meeting with or at least having coffee with or a phone call with.

97
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:08,160
I spent so much time just hooking up my lungs essentially that I had just didn't get to anything but the business at hand.

98
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,160
New York was beautiful, by the way.

99
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:19,160
Man, and I wish I could have told you this yesterday, but it was so nice when you walk out of your hotel and it's got that crisp.

100
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,160
I don't know if you've never been in New York.

101
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,160
There's something about autumn that crisp kind of feeling in the air.

102
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,160
They didn't quite have the chestnuts roasting outside on the cart yet, but the sun was shining.

103
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,160
It was a nice mild, like just around 70 degrees in the morning.

104
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:39,160
And you kind of have that really crackling fresh feeling.

105
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,160
And it was really nice to be back in New York for that reason.

106
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:53,160
I really, of course, the lady Patricia and I lived there for a year and we lived in Jersey, which was pretty damn close enough for 12 years, whatever.

107
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:59,160
So going into New York every single day, just it reminded me and New York is kind of always like New York.

108
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,160
It's just always kind of the same.

109
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:10,160
Now the hotel we stayed at was the, another one of these fantastic botic hotels.

110
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
Yes.

111
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,160
Made by the, I think the same people that did the Sanderson in London.

112
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
We talked about that.

113
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,160
The hotel with the fucking egg in the room, the big egg.

114
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:27,160
So this, it's an E.N. Shreger hotel, which means that they get an old piece of shit building.

115
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,160
And they dress it up with oversized furniture.

116
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,160
And an old furniture that they throw sheets over to kind of mass that it's old.

117
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,160
And all of a sudden it looks hip and you put some interesting chandeliers in.

118
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:46,160
And then you got to put some, some beautiful people who run the place, which is really interesting when you have beautiful people at a hotel.

119
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:54,160
This is the Grammarcy Park Hotel I'm talking about, which, by the way, as E.N. Shreger hotels go, the, the decor was nice.

120
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,160
It's my kind of decor kind of a plush, you know, red velvety type vibe.

121
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,160
Man, the hotel is so dark inside, you know, the wind, everything's just dark.

122
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,160
It's all artificial lighting, so it really made me nuts after a while.

123
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,160
You know, I'd get up, I'd do a breakfast meeting, and then go back and kind of like, you know, hang out kind of like a zombie.

124
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:22,160
I've tried every single cold medicine known to man, and it's just, I was so stoned from Tylenol, day quill, night quill, oh man.

125
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:29,160
And then sitting in this, you know, red velvety plush, very dark hotel was, yeah.

126
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:37,160
I just want to run a bath and hop in, dragging the toaster almost.

127
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:46,160
So when you had the beautiful people at the hotel, that means service is shit, because they're way too, um, concerned with looking cool for the people at the bar downstairs.

128
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,160
And what is this with room service? It says now right on the room service menu.

129
00:10:52,160 --> 00:11:00,160
For your convenience, we will charge you 18% gratuity plus a five dollar delivery charge.

130
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,160
So if you just want to have breakfast like 50 bucks and like, no, I'm going outside.

131
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
This is New York, I'm going to go find something outside.

132
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,160
Go get a night, you know, get something at the deli.

133
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
Uh, anyway.

134
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,160
Uh, so I am feeling a little bit a little bit better.

135
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,160
Let me see, um, let's see if I can re retrace the steps.

136
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,160
Oh, I flew on jet blue for the first time, which I had no idea what it was.

137
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:31,160
Um, they're using the airbus 320, which is, I think the same aircraft that easy jet users only.

138
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,160
If you've never been on jet blue, it's kind of like, you know, it's the service I'd like.

139
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,160
It's the bus, just like the, well, the name says at the airbus.

140
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,160
And there's three seats on each side of the aisle.

141
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,160
And, uh, it's like the nice gray leather seat.

142
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,160
And it's not that wide, but it is.

143
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,160
It feels like it's probably two or three inches wider than your normal, uh, real packed-up,

144
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,160
sardine coat seat.

145
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:01,160
And the, the leg room between the seat in front of you and your, and your seat is really, it's sufficient.

146
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,160
So even I could stretch my legs out without my knees or my shins hitting the seat in front of me.

147
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,160
Um, and you get your, uh, direct TV, you know, 36 channels of live television,

148
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,160
which actually, you know, I found could get me through most of the flight.

149
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,160
They don't serve any food, you have blooper-tated chips and, and water and coffee and stuff.

150
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,160
Uh, but I liked it.

151
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,160
I really, you know, I'm, I'm a big fan of, you know, just give me a comfortable bus

152
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,160
that everyone can just, you know, get on and get off him, and that's perfect.

153
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
And I have to say, great service.

154
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,160
And, uh, relatively inexpensive.

155
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,160
I think, uh, what was it round trip was like five or six hundred bucks, which, uh,

156
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,160
uh, now that's value for money.

157
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,160
I really enjoyed enjoying paying that.

158
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,160
That's cool.

159
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,160
Uh, a couple of things I'm going to tell you about New York.

160
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,160
Uh, first I got a, I got a correct, uh, mistake.

161
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,160
Well, I didn't really make a mistake, but, you know, I said the other day, I think it was, uh,

162
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,160
either Monday or Friday.

163
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,160
I was wondering what, uh, what the currency of Ireland was.

164
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,160
And of course, I said something stupid like,

165
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Dubloons.

166
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,160
Yeah, I've got a lot of love email these days.

167
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
Hey, Adam is pretty awesome.

168
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,160
And I'm sure you're getting eight thousand messages about this.

169
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,160
But the currency in Ireland is the euro.

170
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,160
They're part of the European Union.

171
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:19,160
And the only thing that makes it tough is when you're doing the UK Scottish

172
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,160
Ireland tour on those wonderful brick rail passes,

173
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,160
that what you do all of it and see all of the

174
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,160
Isles there together is that there's a different currency and a different

175
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
print in each place.

176
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,160
Uh, the bank of Scotland has their own notes.

177
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,160
The ulcer banks and everything.

178
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,160
And Northern Ireland have their own notes.

179
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,160
Each bank issues their own.

180
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,160
In fact, some of them are actually made a plastic.

181
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,160
It's quite strange.

182
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,160
And then you go down to Dublin.

183
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,160
And everybody uses Europe.

184
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,160
And then back again.

185
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,160
So, hope that's helpful.

186
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,160
I'm sure you're getting eight thousand messages.

187
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,160
Take care.

188
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,160
I hope you're feeling better.

189
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,160
And try that airborne stuff.

190
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,160
That really works to sort of hit off cold.

191
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,160
When you start feeling that congestion coming on.

192
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,160
It works like a charm.

193
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,160
Take care.

194
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,160
Bye bye.

195
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
It's amazing.

196
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,160
So many people have said that to me that airborne stuff.

197
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,160
And there's a million different versions of the airborne brand.

198
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,160
And of course everyone's telling me to take it after I already have contracted.

199
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,160
I stopped that type of airborne virus.

200
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,160
When you're breathing the same air as everybody else for 10 hours in a row.

201
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,160
Recycle air.

202
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
But appreciate it.

203
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,160
Yeah, of course it's the euro.

204
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
I knew that.

205
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,160
I was kind of thinking what wasn't before then.

206
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,160
And that is true, by the way.

207
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,160
If you've never been to Europe that we all would.

208
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,160
So now we basically everybody has the same monetary unit.

209
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,160
The euro except for the UK and Sweden.

210
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,160
I want to say Sweden didn't participate.

211
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,160
They still have the corona.

212
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,160
But every single bank note is minted.

213
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,160
Well, I think it's minted in individual countries.

214
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,160
And they have their own pictures on it.

215
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,160
Excuse me, Sensei.

216
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,160
I'm going brought to you by Splendid.

217
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,160
DestinationSplendid.com.

218
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,160
Now destinationflavor.com.

219
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
That's what I was.

220
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,160
I got a chance out in the show notes too.

221
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,160
And the hell was I saying?

222
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,160
Yeah.

223
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:32,160
So actually in, I think the most euro currency I've seen is all been German.

224
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,160
Because there's just so much Germanness in Europe.

225
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,160
And I guess the German is travel a lot because you see a lot of German euro coins everywhere.

226
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
Actually.

227
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
So thank you.

228
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,160
Thousands of you who sent that message to the same message.

229
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
Oh, I got my Mac back, by the way.

230
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
Yeah.

231
00:15:53,160 --> 00:16:00,160
This is the power book G4, which was the third in a series to blow up successfully.

232
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
And I got so fed up with it.

233
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,160
And that's when I got the via laptop.

234
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,160
So Guillermo at Podio HQ the other day, he said,

235
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,160
Hey, dude, we got your power book G4 back.

236
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,160
And all your data is intact.

237
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
We were able to save all the data.

238
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,160
In fact, you almost have an entirely new laptop.

239
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
So what are you talking about?

240
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,160
Well, I look at the parts list of all the shit they had to replace.

241
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,160
And I was really weird.

242
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:30,160
It was like they replaced all kinds of encasing around the drive and the power unit and the memory.

243
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,160
And all these different, really structural bits.

244
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,160
And, you know, if you look at this list, it does indeed almost look like they gave me a whole new power book.

245
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:45,160
Of course, this gave me immediately gave me the opportunity to, you know, to play around with it.

246
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,160
And the first thing I know, well, the two things I noticed,

247
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,160
yeah, you cannot beat how nice everything looks on the screen on a Mac.

248
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,160
You just can't.

249
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,160
Although, I think the luminance,

250
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,160
the luminance,

251
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,160
is that what's called the luminance, the brightness that I'm getting from the via screen.

252
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,160
Man, that's, it's so much more light that comes off that thing compared to the Mac and Taj.

253
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
But there is something really nice about that.

254
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,160
I guess it's the courts overlay.

255
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,160
And then the next thing you know, it is almost immediately,

256
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,160
it's how slow it really is compared to this dual core intel,

257
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,160
dual core pro,

258
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,160
fuchum, flakum, whatever it is.

259
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,160
Even just using a browser, you know, if I just use Firefox over Firefox,

260
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,160
just how things open and how things scroll, it really is.

261
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,160
It feels like it's probably not half a slow, but it really does feel like it.

262
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,160
So now I'm using both now.

263
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,160
I'm, I'm just by.

264
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,160
So the whole reason we were actually in New York was for this conference.

265
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,160
Of course, we took advantage of the fact that Ron and I were there,

266
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
and we had a sales Weasel Gregg,

267
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,160
we had our new sales Weasel Andrew,

268
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,160
Bedowski,

269
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,160
who else do we have there, pod, pan, pan,

270
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
brousel was there.

271
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,160
Yeah, it really was the,

272
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,160
the go out kick ass and,

273
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,160
and sell stuff team.

274
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,160
And it was a, I guess it's symposium or a conference.

275
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,160
I'd like to call it symposium actually,

276
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,160
which was organized by an agency that we work with OMD,

277
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,160
and they were doing this this full day for their clients.

278
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,160
This is typically what we do for your clients.

279
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:27,160
A look into the future of, of internet, a series of tubes.

280
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
It was called White Hot and Digital,

281
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,160
but what's kind of cool about is they did it in the NBC studios,

282
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
not just the NBC studios,

283
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,160
but these Saturday night live studios,

284
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,160
which they had basically, you know,

285
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
the set was all there.

286
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,160
They just converted a couple pieces,

287
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,160
so it could be a stage.

288
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,160
And it was essentially, you know,

289
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,160
a full day of listening to speakers different,

290
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
from different backgrounds, different disciplines.

291
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
And I was on a panel,

292
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
and this was a lot of fun.

293
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
And by the way,

294
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,160
we weren't allowed to take any pictures there.

295
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
You know,

296
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,160
so only the NBC staff photographer,

297
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
I guess it was taken,

298
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
it was allowed to take pictures.

299
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
So I'm waiting to get some pictures back.

300
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
But I was on a panel,

301
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,160
which was moderated by Josh Quittner,

302
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,160
who I've known for 100 years.

303
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,160
And I think he's another editor and chief of business 2.0.

304
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,160
But I know him back from the MTV.com days.

305
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,160
He had actually,

306
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,160
he wrote a lot about the domain name dispute

307
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,160
that I had with MTV,

308
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,160
and he had registered McDonald's.com, I think.

309
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,160
So, you know,

310
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
we kind of share some history there,

311
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
and he was moderating the panel,

312
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
and the panel consisted of myself,

313
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,160
of Christopher Wolfe, CEO of my space,

314
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
I think so.

315
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,160
And Chad,

316
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,160
the co-founder of YouTube.

317
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
So, you know,

318
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
this was fun.

319
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,160
It was fun for the three of us to be sitting there,

320
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,160
and really talking about three different ways

321
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
of how our businesses work,

322
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
and they really are three different types of businesses,

323
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
fascinating,

324
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,160
we've had Chris, by the way,

325
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,160
from my space.

326
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,160
Dude, I think this guy's got an inch on me.

327
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,160
It's fucking tall, unbelievable.

328
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
It's like, you know,

329
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,160
three, you know,

330
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,160
dirty, blondish, geeky boys on a panel.

331
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,160
Oh, shoot.

332
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,160
Yeah.

333
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,160
It's like I've been hooking up a lung.

334
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,160
Oh, hold on.

335
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,160
Do some for yourself.

336
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:32,160
People talk about it, baby.

337
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:38,160
Sam, doing it wrong, doing it wrong.

338
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,160
We don't you worry, baby.

339
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Don't worry.

340
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
Cause I'm a wife,

341
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,160
and wife,

342
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
and wife,

343
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,160
and my bum.

344
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
Cause I'm a folder,

345
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,160
I'm a scruncher,

346
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,160
I'm a roller,

347
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,160
and I'm a buncher.

348
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:01,160
I do my business on the throne.

349
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
I'm a sitter,

350
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,160
I'm a standard,

351
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,160
I'm a left-to-right tender.

352
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,160
It's nice to know I'm not alone.

353
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Yeah, I've noticed that,

354
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,160
you know, all that gunk and stuff,

355
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,160
it only really kicks in when I'm laugh.

356
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,160
It didn't happen on the panel, luckily.

357
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,160
Although I did get the audience to go for a second there.

358
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
It was,

359
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
what we're talking about,

360
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,160
it was, oh, you're talking about advertising.

361
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
Oh, how,

362
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
you know,

363
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,160
I look at advertising as content,

364
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,160
something to do something with.

365
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
Like the splendid stuff we've been talking with,

366
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,160
what a fantastic example.

367
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,160
All the stories you've been sending me about,

368
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
Splendon,

369
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,160
the mix as you've been making.

370
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,160
And I said,

371
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,160
you know,

372
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,160
when's the last time someone called you up and said,

373
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,160
hey,

374
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,160
fantastic direct mail piece you sent me.

375
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,160
You know,

376
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
I love the way you started that,

377
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,160
got pulled my name out of the hat.

378
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,160
You know,

379
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,160
when's the last time someone called a company and said,

380
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,160
hey, man,

381
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,160
it was,

382
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,160
thanks for letting me click through.

383
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,160
Great banner.

384
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,160
You just don't hear that stuff.

385
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,160
So it was a good conversation in the audience,

386
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
who,

387
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
unfortunately,

388
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,160
also due to just the illness and the weather was crap.

389
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,160
We had to go,

390
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,160
you know,

391
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,160
it took us two hours to get to the airport.

392
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
When it rains in New York,

393
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
you know what happens.

394
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,160
Joseph Jaffee was there.

395
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,160
So it was nice to meet him in person.

396
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,160
I unfortunately,

397
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,160
I really didn't have time.

398
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,160
You know,

399
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,160
the morning just say, hey,

400
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,160
how you doing bend over.

401
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,160
So we'll have to catch him another time.

402
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,160
It was good to see him though.

403
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,160
Let me give you this one promo.

404
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,160
And then I got another song for you for today.

405
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
You like this, I think,

406
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,160
hold on.

407
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,160
Check this out.

408
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,160
The rustling leaves

409
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,160
and increasing darkness

410
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,160
herald the approach of all Hallows Eve.

411
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,160
It is a time for ghouls,

412
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,160
goblins

413
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,160
and spooks

414
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
to roam free among us.

415
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,160
This year,

416
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,160
the window to the magic dot com podcast

417
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,160
will be playing host

418
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,160
to these specters

419
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,160
as they bring you an all new

420
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,160
Halloween show.

421
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,160
This will be unlike anything

422
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,160
you have heard from them before.

423
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
Join us

to present the all original radio drama

428
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,160
secrets of the wooden door.

Your favorite window to the magic personalities

430
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,160
and some very special guests

431
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,160
will venture forth into unknown

432
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,160
environments of the famous

433
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,160
haunted mansion.

434
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,160
Listen in

435
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,160
if you dare.

436
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,160
All right.

437
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,160
And of course,

438
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,160
with Halloween just around the door,

439
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,160
you can also organize a shadow

440
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,160
falls listening party.

441
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,160
We got to figure out if we're going to do

442
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,160
another season of shadow falls.

443
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,160
I feel like I don't want to be left hanging.

444
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,160
That's for sure.

445
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
You haven't heard it yet.

446
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Episode six is out.

447
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,160
Shadowfall. podshow.com.

448
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,160
Very good.

449
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,160
Very good stuff.

450
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
Okay.

451
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
So anyway,

452
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
so we got back last night.

453
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,160
Of course,

454
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,160
everything was delayed by an hour.

455
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,160
Got into Oakland at 1 a.m.

456
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,160
in bed by around 2.30

457
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,160
and you can understand just how

458
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,160
crappy I feel today.

459
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,160
If you listen to us on

460
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
serious stars,

461
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,160
one or two got a fantastic line up

462
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,160
with the podshow on serious

463
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
for you for the next

464
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,160
three and a half hours

465
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,160
taking up until 10 o'clock eastern.

466
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,160
And for those of you

467
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
checking us out on the podcast.

468
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Oh,

469
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,160
I got some cool music for you.

470
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,160
Dennis Gray from

471
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,160
101 uses for baby wipes.

472
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,160
Probably remember the podshow podcast network.

473
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,160
It sends in dude this song

474
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,160
from Kelly Le Evans.

475
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,160
She's cute clever.

476
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
Songs very mellow.

477
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,160
It's fantastic when you're night

478
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,160
not feeling too well.

479
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,160
It's quote nice jazz

480
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,160
to blow your nose to you.

481
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,160
You don't call me anymore.

482
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,160
I just as I play.

483
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,160
Finally I can be alone.

484
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,160
Things were so out of hand.

485
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,160
But these minds are cold without you.

486
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,160
And every day I still dream about you.

487
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,160
How can you get along with them me?

488
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,160
How dare you love again?

489
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,160
Who is she?

490
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,160
How can you get along with them me?

491
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,160
When I still need you,

492
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,160
I still need you.

493
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,160
I still need you.

494
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,160
I still need you.

495
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,160
I still need you.

496
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,160
I still need you.

497
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:21,160
So let's just say that I miss both.

498
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,160
We can start love again.

499
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,160
We can pretend it was all a joke.

500
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,160
You can get a ready on your friend.

501
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,160
Because these minds are cold without you.

502
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,160
How dare every day I still dream about you.

503
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,160
How can you get along with them me?

504
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,160
How dare you love again?

505
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,160
Who is she?

506
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,160
How can you get along with them me?

507
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,160
When I still need you,

508
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,160
I still need you.

509
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,160
I still need you.

510
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,160
I still need you.

511
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,160
I still need you.

512
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,160
I still need you.

513
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,160
I'll be so sure.

514
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,160
I'll be so sweet.

515
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,160
You won't recognize me.

516
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,160
Can you ignore what I said last week?

517
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,160
You always said I was crazy.

518
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,160
Crazy.

519
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,160
Crazy.

520
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,160
I'm crazy about you.

521
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,160
How can you get along with them me?

522
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,160
How dare you love again?

523
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,160
Who is she?

524
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,160
How can you get along with them me?

525
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,160
When I still need you,

526
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
I still need you.

527
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,160
I still need you.

528
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
I still need you.

529
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,160
I still need you.

530
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,160
I still need you.

531
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,160
I still need you.

532
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,160
I still need you.

533
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,160
I still need you.

534
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,160
You're right, Dennis.

535
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,160
Thank you, man.

536
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,160
Kelly Lee Evans.

537
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
How can I get along without you?

538
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,160
Now on the pod save music network,

539
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,160
you can find a link to that in the show notes today at dailysourcecode.com.

540
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,160
All right, so I'm going to regroup here.

541
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Blow my shnaz a couple more times.

542
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,160
Get dressed and then it's off to HQ.

543
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,160
I am kind of ready to go back home.

544
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
I have to say I'm missing the girls very much.

545
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,160
The in laws are they're going back today.

546
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,160
So I missed their visit.

547
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:40,160
Which I'm sad about because it's always fun to hang out with my in laws for limited period of time.

548
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,160
Um,

549
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,160
crap, I don't know.

550
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,160
So much stuff.

551
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,160
So much stuff to do.

552
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,160
I always feel like I'm short-changing you guys.

553
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
One amount here because there's so much that goes on.

554
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,160
My head literally swims.

555
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,160
Okay, well you got to run down from New York.

556
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,160
And tomorrow I'll tell you what's happening here in San Francisco.

557
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,160
Because we got new people coming in, new things we're doing.

558
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,160
We're getting very close to the official official unleash of

559
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,160
BTpodshow.com.

560
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,160
So we're all going to be back in the UK pretty soon.

561
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,160
It's just a lot of shit going on.

562
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,160
But it is a lot of fun.

563
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
Hey, give me a call.

564
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,160
I haven't gotten a lot of voicemail recently.

565
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,160
And I think it's probably because I haven't been hawking the numbers much as I used to.

566
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,160
Um,

567
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,160
plus one 20120163.

568
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,160
What the hell is it?

569
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,160
Yeah, that's it.

570
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
Now everybody.

571
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,160
Talk to you tomorrow.

572
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,160
Adam at podshow.com.

573
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,160
See you, bye.

574
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,160
Another podshow podcast.

575
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,160
Stick it in your ear.
