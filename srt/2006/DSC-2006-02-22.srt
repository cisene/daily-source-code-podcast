1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 34-0.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Fantastic, it's a battle curry.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hey everybody, it is time for the Charlie.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Some different today.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You've probably read somewhere in a newspaper or more likely you've seen on television.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The bird flu is coming.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But I don't know much about it.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I was lucky enough to find out that our investors are one of our investors in pod show and

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
smaller burkins.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Can tell us a lot more about it and are actually doing something about it.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So I thought I'd share that today with you on the source code.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And we're going to get to that.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well right after we hear from our friends over, or a think of course.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Do you believe anything is possible?

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We do.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We're our flank.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We believe in an internet that's safe from viruses and scammers.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We're Earthlink.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We believe your personal information should be just that.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Personal.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We revolve around you.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Joining the conversation on the Charlie now

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
is bookbires.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The B in cleaner perkins.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Callfield and buyers.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And Dr. Beth Sidenberg of Biocrist Pharmaceuticals.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Both are on the board of directors of the pandemic preparedness and bio defense fund, which

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
was announced last week.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I thank you both for taking the time to talk about this.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So I was in New York last week.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And I read the announcement in New York Times.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And it blew me away.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Mainly because all of a sudden this thing became real for me.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We're talking specifically about avian flu or the bird flu.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Here's a group of very smart people who I guess believe that something is probably going

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
to happen or it's inevitable and putting their money where the mouth is so to speak.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Maybe I should start with Brooke with you.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Can you just explain, what exactly?

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This is a $200 million fund.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What does that mean?

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Is there already?

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Is there $200 million that you are now starting to invest?

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Does this money already exist?

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
How exactly does that work?

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What is an investment fund, I guess, is what I'm asking?

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Sure, Adam.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So yes, our firm, client-approved, and call to the buyers, is a venture capital firm based

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
in Manlo Park, California.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And we have raised and completed that process.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
$200 million fund specifically targeted toward what we call pandemic preparedness innovation.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And the reason we're doing this is to call attention to the severity of the problem.

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And our belief that more attention needs to be paid to innovation gaps in preparing for

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
pandemic pathogens and global public health issues.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And by innovation gaps, what we mean are vaccine, any viral, and diagnostic products that are needed

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
by the world that are just not getting developed quickly enough.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So this is the thing that almost troubles me when I think about this.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And clearly when you get into the business of investing, other people's money as well into this area,

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
that means that you are expecting this to work.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I presume that that's kind of funny.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Will the fund be successful if the flu actually breaks out, or if we actually need something,

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
or am I seeing that a little too short-sighted there?

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Well, the innovations that are needed in vaccines, any viral drugs and diagnostics,

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
are ones that are platform technologies.

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So we hope a pandemic never happens, even a mild one.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
If it does, the world is going to need these innovative products to make it as less severe as possible.

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If a pandemic does not occur, these kinds of innovations, these kind of products,

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
can be applied to other infectious diseases as well.

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And it's very fortuitous for our firm that last spring, Dr. Bestseinberg joined us as a partner here at

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Clienter Procus, Coffield and Buyers.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And she brings the background of 25 years of product development experience at the

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
National Institutes of Health, Mer, Crystal Myers, and Amgen.

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And so Beth, one or two come in on this.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay, great. Thank you, Brooke.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah, Adam, I think that it's important for us to recognize that influenza is a great example of what we call emerging

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
or an emergent infectious disease, meaning something that occurs and can change on an annual basis

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and create disease in millions of people.

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
In order to really understand the disease that's developing,

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
you need to be able to see it coming in the environment, you know,

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:22,000
so in a specific country, be able to diagnose it with rapid tools and then treat it and prevent it.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And technology needs to be flexible, needs to be able to be applied quickly,

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and made available to people around the world.

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And flu gives us an opportunity to focus on those types of innovations and technologies,

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and apply them to other infectious diseases if they were to occur.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay, so a lot of the media talk now, which I actually despise it because all they're doing,

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I feel is just freaking people out and not even talking about possible solutions other than this so-called

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
stockpile of Tammy flu or whatever it should be available.

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Actually, I lived in Belgium for about five years, and I think it was two years ago,

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
what they were calling the bird flu, swept through continental Europe,

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and actually we were only one kilometer outside of the quarantine area,

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and we actually had officials come by and investigate,

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
we had a family of like six black swans, and, you know, they were ready to quote,

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
call them if necessary, and one of my neighbors was working on a lot of the calling,

101
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and he actually got, I guess, the bird flu, which I presume that, you know,

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
that is indeed possible that you get this from birds, and he was really quite ill.

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He, you know, he was okay.

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Are we really talking now about the, you know, a pandemic or the one that everyone is talking about,

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and I'd love to talk about some more, you know, just bio-defense in general,

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
is it, is it the tipping point where it spreads from human to human,

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and is that something that is a reality?

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You know, Adam, I think the way to look at this is,

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
there, if you think about the birds, whether it's, you know, swans or chickens,

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:16,000
or just any kind of migratory bird, consider them the natural reservoir for influenza.

111
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's not uncommon that these birds carry flu,

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and the key question and what we're worried about is, will the virus change

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
when it replicates, when it makes more of itself, will it change to a form

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,000
that will allow it to be infectious, not only from birds to people or birds to pigs, for example,

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
but from person to person.

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And the only way that that can happen is when it's making more of itself,

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
the virus, and it's called replication, it has to make a mistake,

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and change or mutate that virus to a form where then it becomes highly infectious

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
from person to person.

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Is it possible for that to happen?

121
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Absolutely.

122
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Can we predict when it will happen or the probability of that happening?

123
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
We can't predict that.

124
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We do know that annual flu often goes through that process.

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Birds, or the reservoir, it goes into what you consider a mixing vessel

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
or another kind of intermediary species, which is a pig,

127
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and then it can be transformed or mutated into a form that infects person to person.

128
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So KPCB is really known for a lot of its technology investments

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
certainly in the recent decade.

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The technology, as I understand it, of creating vaccines,

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
is actually antiquated, maybe not the right word,

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
but you still use chicken eggs to actually develop anti-virus matter?

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, that's right, Adam.

134
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The way vaccines are made today are in eggs.

135
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I mean, literally tens of millions of them.

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And that's where the vaccine that we all get, hopefully everyone,

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
listening gets every year for what we call the seasonal flu.

138
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And that vaccine contains the best guess by public health experts

139
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
each year of three strains that were probably going around the world.

140
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But that technique has not been replaced.

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So that's part of the innovation gap set that we were talking about.

142
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And so what we're doing with this new funding is we're searching worldwide

143
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
for innovators, young companies, inventors, and scientists,

144
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
who are developing ways of making vaccines and cells.

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So, so-called cellular production.

146
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Or even beyond that, not in cells, so a DNA-based vaccine.

147
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And the advantage of these is, first of all, they don't use eggs,

148
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
which would be problematic, a baby, and flu breaks out human human.

149
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And secondly, these production techniques allow a shorter time

150
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
of response, what we call surge capacity.

151
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So instead of the current six months it takes to scale up a lot of vaccine doses

152
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
for the world, it could take literally six weeks,

153
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
or maybe even shorter.

154
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And then also new vaccine production techniques

155
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and product development techniques, formulation, and so on.

156
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
We call it would allow vaccines that are more exquisitely immunogenic,

157
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
which means less can be given to a person to protect them.

158
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
In the antiviral space, there is Tamiflu, which is a good drug,

159
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
but we don't know how will it would work against

160
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
really strong new viruses that come out.

161
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It works okay against the seasonal flu,

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
but against avian flu so far in Southeast Asia.

163
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It hasn't worked so well in humans.

164
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And so there is some new antivirals that are being developed.

165
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We want to invest in those and encourage the development of them

166
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
by our capital as well.

167
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So, as a broken obvious question is,

168
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
in the grand scale of preparedness and defense against anything

169
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
in today's world, you know, $200 million

170
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
with all respect is chump change.

171
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If you just look at what we're spending on the war against terror.

172
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Is this, I mean, is that enough?

173
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
If it's, and if it's only $200 million,

174
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
why isn't the government doing this type of funding

175
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and working hard or NGOs or any other organizations

176
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
besides venture capital?

177
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Well, they are as well.

178
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So, there are a lot of people working on this problem.

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The United States Federal Government works on it

180
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
from a variety of points of view.

181
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The National Institutes of Health has an allergy and infectious disease

182
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
division that funds research.

183
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But, and so does the HHS and the CDC,

184
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Health and Human Services and Centers for Disease Control.

185
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But, their role as government is to encourage research

186
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
to fund some of it.

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Government doesn't develop products.

188
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
The private sector does that.

189
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And so, our $200 million will go to that

190
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
to developing the products that then go out

191
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
into the public health system.

192
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Now, as your question of a quantitation of that

193
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
or size of it, generally when we invest in a company,

194
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
there are other investors who will follow our lead.

195
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And so, usually, there's a four or five

196
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
to one multiple on that.

197
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So, we estimate that.

198
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So, our investing will probably lead to about a billion

199
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
dollars of investment in these companies.

200
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So, then, there's two obvious questions that arise.

201
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
One is, so let's say the fund produces one or more

202
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
technologies or products that actually are effective.

203
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That has the capability, of course, of making the investors

204
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
and the fund in these products wealthy beyond their wildest dreams.

205
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And there's always the question of, well, is it made affordable

206
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
for everyone can, you know, will it only be a certain segment

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
that then kind of access to this technology or this medication

208
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
to actually survive an outbreak?

209
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Is, you know, how do you look at that?

210
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Well, it's way more complicated than that.

211
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
First of all, I don't think in infectious diseases

212
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
or anyone gets wealthy beyond their wildest dreams.

213
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Because there's a desire just as you said

214
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
to get these products out to everyone.

215
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
In the developed countries, the drugs like this

216
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
would be priced at a rate, what we call a reasonable price.

217
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And then it's our goal to have these drugs available

218
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
in the less developed countries at cost or some other method

219
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
of getting it to them so that this can be a worldwide phenomenon.

220
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And it's important to think as Tom Friedman says the world is flat.

221
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's especially true in infectious diseases

222
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
because with worldwide travel and how people move around today

223
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and infectious diseases starts in one country

224
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
really is local to every country in the world.

225
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Beth, I believe that part of the fund has already been allocated

226
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
towards your work.

227
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Could you tell me what you're doing?

228
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yes, sure, Adam.

229
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So one of our first investments is in a company called Biocrist,

230
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
which is a drug discovery company that has an important

231
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
antiviral agent called Paramavir.

232
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
We believe as Brooke mentioned that it's very important to have

233
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
multiple options to choose from when if there is a diagnosis of flu

234
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
in your ability to treat patients.

235
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Paramavir is a similar mechanism to Tamiflu

236
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
and it can be given intravenously.

237
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So in particular for patients who are very ill and in the hospital

238
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
parameter we hope will be a very important therapeutic option.

239
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Now let's just say there's no pandemic or maybe just a very mild one.

240
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I presume we don't lose.

241
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I presume the investments are for long term and not just a short term.

242
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh my gosh, the black death plague is coming.

243
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Is this all for the long term?

244
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yes.

245
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
This is not dependent upon anything bad happening.

246
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Sure.

247
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah.

248
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So venture capital is really a 10 year horizon on investing.

249
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That's true in all technology and science areas.

250
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's especially true in this one.

251
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And as I mentioned earlier, so a new vaccine production technique for flu

252
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,000
or avian flu or new strains of that would be applicable to new vaccine technology

253
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:31,000
production methods for hepatitis and herbysimplex and many other kinds of diseases

254
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
respiratory viral diseases that are around today.

255
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's important to remember that there are over 20 new infectious pathogens that have emerged

256
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:51,000
since 1970 in the world, HIV being one, of course, that's been devastating in this tragic.

257
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
We haven't talked about diagnostics and that's another area that's very important.

258
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
There is, for example, today, no rapid diagnostic test that can be used point of care

259
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
to determine if someone has avian flu.

260
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's possible to go in right now and get a rapid test to see if you have the annual flu, but not avian.

261
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What's the incubation period of the avian flu?

262
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
What's the incubation period?

263
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Well, that's an interesting question.

264
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The incubation period, it doesn't show symptoms so far on avian flu for at least seven days,

265
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
but the person can be infectious by the second day.

266
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So a person could be walking around in the infectious state, but not be symptomatic.

267
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So there's a need for a test that could be done by an untrained technician with agricultural workers

268
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
or at an airport check-in facility or something like that.

269
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So the sick people will know that they're sick and healthy will know that they're okay.

270
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And then you would know who to give like aggressive antiviral therapy to.

271
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:16,000
If you read the paper today when they take the samples that you read about in Turkey or Iraq or India now or wherever,

272
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
it takes days to get confirmation.

273
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So that's a second diagnostic test that's needed.

274
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,000
There would use less technology of instruments in a special lab and more out in the field.

275
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Well, that does sound like your first line of defense is identification within timely manner, I agree on that.

276
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Just moving on to the bio-defense part of the fund.

277
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Whenever I read the word defense, I immediately think of aerospace and defense and I think war.

278
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Is that how I should interpret that?

279
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:57,000
No, the way we think of that is that these are infectious pathogens, regardless of the delivery system.

280
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So what works for public health works sort of across the board?

281
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Excellent.

282
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Well, I guess the only thing that's left is to stay close to you guys and real happy.

283
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Because if something breaks out, you know I'm going to be living in your basement.

284
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Well, you're welcome too.

285
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And just break that car.

286
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah, we'll we'll turn it by.

287
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But so I just in general, just as a final question, should we really be,

288
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I mean, this is great to hear.

289
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm really happy to know that there, you know, at least understand some of the work that's going on,

290
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and even understanding about, you know, the identification in a timely manner,

291
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and knowledge of if someone is infected, is all the fear that is being built up now,

292
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
particularly on television.

293
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Is it warranted?

294
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And I guess that's the best question.

295
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Is it really warranted?

296
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It feels like this thing is just around the corner.

297
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And now in the United Kingdom, it's like, you know, bring all the birds in because it's coming.

298
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It just feels like, you know, it's being whipped into a frenzy almost.

299
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Well, Adam, I think that there's reason to worry because the virus that we've seen that's infected people directly from birds.

300
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Is a very, very, very, very severe type of infection that develops in people.

301
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And so there is reason to have careful evaluation, increased surveillance and diagnosis,

302
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
whether it's in the birds or people.

303
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And I think that, you know, the silver lining for us here is being prepared,

304
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and moving innovation forward in this area of emerging infectious diseases is going to be a very good thing for the population at large for the global,

305
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
for the world, whether we have a pandemic from an avian flu or not.

306
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
We're going to modernize with vaccine business.

307
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
We have an opportunity to have better diagnostics and better therapies for people.

308
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And we think it'll make an important contribution.

309
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Well, I appreciate both of you taking the time to explain some of this to me today.

310
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And definitely, you know, keep me updated on progress.

311
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Brooke, if someone's listening right now and thinks, you know,

312
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Wow, you know, I have an idea or I have a plan.

313
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I mean, how do they reach out to you?

314
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Oh, they just go to the our website www.kpcb.com.

315
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Okay, and then I'd like to know if you've ever considered doing a podcast,

316
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
because you've got a great voice, Brooke, you'd be perfect for one.

317
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Well, I'm just trying to be like you.

318
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Got to grow the hair man, that's all.

319
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Best side in Bergberg by us.

320
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Thank you very much.

321
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And let's definitely keep in touch on this and see where it goes.

322
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm sure the audience would love to be updated as well.

323
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And if you feedback, I get from all past on you guys.

324
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
All right, thank you.

325
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Thanks, Adam.

326
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Well, I don't know, but you guys, are you freaked out by that?

327
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Or not?

328
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm still a little bit confused about how I should feel about this pending pandemic that is upon us.

329
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And by the way, this was the first time that I used Cas Blaster with Skype.

330
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And I'm pretty happy with the result.

331
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I mean, we did all in one go.

332
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
No glitches, everything sounded pretty cool.

333
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Although, you know, a lot of room noise, man.

334
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I never noticed that when I shut up and when someone else is talking,

335
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
it's like you can hear the whole condo kind of breathing, breathing upon you.

336
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And a couple of lighter clicks there in the background,

337
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
but considering the topic, I think it was necessary.

338
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So this is just a temporary format change for the Charlie.

339
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I just wanted to mix it up a little bit.

340
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You know that I'm working on getting my Uncle Don in.

341
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I don't think he'll fit in 20 or 30 minutes,

342
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
we'll probably have to do a series of Uncle Don conversations,

343
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
which I might have to edit, because you know,

344
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
what is it?

345
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's like 50 years of life in Washington and in politics,

346
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
and not just in Washington, but in Asia.

347
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Gosh, I should have asked him about the avian flu as well.

348
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Anyway, so that turned out pretty successful.

349
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Those of you interested, the way I did it with Casplaster is using two sound cards,

350
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
and I just routed Skype through a different sound card,

351
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
and it went through the mixer,

352
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
and came back into Casplaster so that worked out perfectly.

353
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
If you're listening to us on serious stars 103,

354
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
soon to be moving to channel 102.

355
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
So I think that's coming up in a week or so,

356
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
as we move just a little bit closer to God,

357
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
as we can move closer to the Stern channels on 101.

358
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
You've got Pacific Coast Hillway coming up next.

359
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
After that, it's a Madge Weinstein Donandru Gilmour Daily.

360
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Today, maybe, DVD weekly, or which at all.

361
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm not quite sure what's coming up.

362
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And of course, I'm pod save music.

363
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
We do that every single week,

364
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
after noon between 6 and 10 Eastern 3 and 7 Pacific.

365
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Tomorrow I'll be back right here with more daily source code.

366
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
We'll get back into some music.

367
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And we'll finish out the week,

368
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
because I'm hurrying up, getting a lot of stuff done.

369
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So I can go back home.

370
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'll see you, everybody.

371
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Bye-bye.

372
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Another pod show pod guest.

373
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Stick it in your ear.
