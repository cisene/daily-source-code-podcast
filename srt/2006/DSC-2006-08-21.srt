1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
This is Soccer Girl. I just listened to the first episode of Shadow Falls and it's scared me

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,280
crapless.

3
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,280
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

4
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,120
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

5
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,320
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,800
I don't know.

7
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,080
It's the sign of the time for you to come.

8
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,360
I don't know.

9
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,120
If I'm losing my mind, but I'm lost and I'm blind by the chainsay.

10
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,160
Is there any way I wanna hear?

11
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,200
Is there some way to make this really hear?

12
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,440
Because of you, I can't sleep anymore since you walked out the door and you left me.

13
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,440
All I do is stare at the wall, thinking no thoughts at all, step to memory.

14
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,480
Why do you want to try to be insane?

15
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,760
Why do you want to kill me so much pain?

16
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,080
What threw me the sign?

17
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,400
Don't think I can't make it on my own.

18
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,080
Why is it crazy?

19
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,840
I'm just wondering if what I'm doing in my eyes.

20
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,760
I can't feel

21
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,760
Don't know darkness for light

22
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,760
Don't know daytime for light

23
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,760
Honest face and he isn't real

24
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,760
Oh well I wake up from this

25
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,760
And the midst of your cares and embrace

26
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,760
And one thing that I'm in my sports to do

27
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,760
I don't think I can make it without you

28
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:59,760
I don't think I can make it on my own

29
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,760
Don't think I can make it on my own

30
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,760
I'm trying to pray better

31
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,760
My dad's in the long run

32
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,760
Show me size

33
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,760
Tell me that you're still in love with me

34
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,760
Will you be mine?

35
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,760
Will you be mine?

36
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:35,760
Will you be mine?

37
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,760
Show me that you're still in love with me

38
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,760
My dad's in the long run

39
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,760
I don't think I can make it without you

40
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,760
I don't think I can make it on my own

41
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,760
Don't think I can make it on my own

42
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
I'm trying to pray better

43
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,760
My dad's in the long run

44
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,760
Show me size

45
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,760
Tell me that you're still in love with me

46
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:19,760
Will you be mine?

47
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:28,760
Will you be mine?

48
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,760
Will you be mine?

49
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,760
Tell me that you're still in love with me

50
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,760
I know I've played the song before

51
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,760
I've played the song before

52
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,760

00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,760
I've played the song before

00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,760
I've played the song before

87
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,760
I've played the song before

88
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,760
I've played the song before

89
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,760
I've really reliant on that shit

90
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,760
I've really reliant on the podcast

91
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
music network

92
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Every morning it's like

93
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,760
I listen to the new songs

94
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,760
and then I compile my playlist

95
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,760
The one of two songs I'm going to play

96
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,760
and I couldn't do any of that

97
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,760
So I just reached back into the bin

98
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,760
I had to look at my hard drive and pull out Kevin Reeves

99
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,760
What a great song that is

100
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,760
Of course there will be a link to the

101
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
podcast music network page in the show notes

102
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,760
Once it's all back up and run

103
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,760
I finally got my touch and go practice

104
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,760
You know I really want to get my landing skills

105
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,760
even better

106
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,760
I used to be so good with the helicopter

107
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,760
I could put it down

108
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,760
I could put it down better than my instructors

109
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,760
There's something about the way you land a helicopter

110
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,760
being so completely different

111
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,760
even the concept of a flare

112
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,760
being so different in helicopter

113
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,760
versus a fixed wing aircraft

114
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,760
that it's just taking me a little bit longer

115
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
to refine the art

116
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,760
Captain Dan and I suited up on Saturday morning

117
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,760
It was about when was pretty significant

118
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
or pretty significant

119
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,760
it was 15 gusting to 20 25 knots

120
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,760
which is great because what you want to do

121
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,760
is you want to practice your crosswind landings

122
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,760
and the best place to practice landings

123
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,760
is on the grass strip because

124
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,760
well if you if you muck one up

125
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,760
it'll definitely diminish your tires

126
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,760
as we know I'm pretty good

127
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,760
and it's smoking them out

128
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,760
So we flew to Goodwood

129
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,760
which I just love the name Goodwood

130
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,760
which is this fantastic complex

131
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,760
it covers an acre's owned by a real Lord

132
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,760
who has a castle and he has a polo pitch

133
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,760
and he has also he has his airfield

134
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,760
which has four runways

135
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,760
which is fantastic

136
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,760
we're actually not that good for practice

137
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,760
because you know if the wind shifts

138
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760
and they basically shift the runway

139
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,760
but we were able to get some pretty good crosswind landings in

140
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,760
it's got a race track around the whole thing

141
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,760
classic cars racing

142
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,760
just really really nice operation

143
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,760
so it went there it's only maybe 15 minutes or so

144
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,760
now the minute we took off

145
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,760
from Fair Oaks I noticed something was wrong

146
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,760
because basically you do the call outs

147
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,760
the minute you push the engine

148
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
the throttle all the way forward

149
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
metal to metal as we call it

150
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,760
so the throttle is against the metal of the dashboard

151
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,760
or the control panel

152
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,760
you call out power pressure

153
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,760
check temperature again

154
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,760
and then you're looking at your airspeed indicator

155
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,760
which is basically telling you what your airspeed is

156
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,760
how fast you're going

157
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,760
and you're constantly checking that

158
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,760
and of course looking out to make sure you're kind of on the center line

159
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,760
and not veering off the runway

160
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,760
and so the real thing you want to call is airspeed indicator is alive

161
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,760
you've probably heard this if you listen to any of my flying charlies

162
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,760
and so I call it was alive

163
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,760
but I immediately said something's not right here

164
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,760
now it just was indicating too low

165
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,760
typically we'll take off about

166
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,760
about 60 knots

167
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,760
that's about the speed you have when I can pull her up

168
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,760
you wait for a positive rate of climb before you actually bring the gear up

169
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,760
well I'm giving you quite a rundown here aren't I?

170
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,760
so it was only indicating about 40

171
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,760
but I could see that the manifold pressure

172
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,760
engine power RPMs everything was good

173
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,760
so no reason not to lift off lift it off fine

174
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,760
now of course if you're taking off into the wind

175
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,760
which is we were pretty much had the nose right

176
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,760
just a little bit off the left of the nose

177
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,760
that we had the wind off the left of the nose

178
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,760
you have to subtract the wind speed from your airspeed

179
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,760
okay that'll give you your actual ground speed

180
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,760
so the indicated airspeed

181
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,760
if it was 10 knots

182
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,760
headwind would probably say about 50

183
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
and that's when it would start to come off the ground

184
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,760
but I knew it was not gusting at 20 knots at fair oak

185
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,760
so that very moment

186
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,760
but anyway so we went up and as we're flying and you know

187
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,760
there's a lot going on where I immediately have to talk to Farmer or radar

188
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,760
because we're within the airs

189
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,760
we're literally within the Heathrow's airspace

190
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,760
when we take off from fair oak

191
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,760
so our fair oak is within Heathrow's airspace

192
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,760
so you're pretty much controlled as we

193
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,760
bopped out to go to midhurst down to Goodwood

194
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
and I said to Captain Dan I said

195
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,760
you know something's not right with the airspeed indicator

196
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,760
but we kind of thought nothing out of it

197
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,760
because it really can make the difference

198
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,760
you know if you've got the wind

199
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,760
if you've got a strong headwind

200
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,760
your indicated airspeed will be much lower perhaps

201
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,760
the ground speed and it can be reversed too

202
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
obviously depending on where the wind is coming from

203
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,760
so no worries

204
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,760
so we go to do first we landed Goodwood

205
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,760
and have a cup of coffee

206
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
and then alright we just plan everything

207
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,760
look at the circuits which is a little funky there

208
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,760
for runway two four because you don't want to fly over some houses

209
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
and so we start doing our circuits

210
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,760
and landing really is all about attitude

211
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,760
and power it's really about speed control

212
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,760
because just as the aircraft wants to take off

213
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,760
it around sixty six well between sixteen seventy

214
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,760
knots probably sixty five

215
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,760
it also will not land above that

216
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,760
so you have to kind of know how fast you're going

217
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,760
and so on you know as you're coming into your final

218
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,760
turning on the finals for landing

219
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
you want to have it about

220
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,760
seventy five reduced to seventy you want to go full flaps

221
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
which is something I really had to practice with

222
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,760
you know you've got your just it's all a matter of all these things

223
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,760
coming together

224
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,760
and and you really want to be just about to touch down

225
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,760
obviously around sixty five sixty knots

226
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,760
which is just about the speed that it takes off

227
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,760
and so this is your indicated air speed

228
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,760
and as we're you know I couldn't I couldn't get it

229
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,760
you know we were bouncing and you know yeah I could get the

230
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,760
thing on the ground but it was anything but a good landing

231
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
and it was just it was freaky me out

232
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,760
and like I can't understand this I've been flying for hundreds of

233
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,760
years I can't I land now

234
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,760
and then so Captain Dan says well let me give you

235
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,760
you follow through in the controls and I'll do one for you

236
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,760
and we come in you know and he bounces that sucker

237
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
and off the runway

238
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,760
and then we we kind of figured it out hey wait a minute

239
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,760
the air speed indicator really is busted now this of course is from that

240
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,760
hard landing I made with Patricia which wasn't all that hard

241
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,760
because you haven't heard her complain about it

242
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,760
but that's when the needle got stuck while apparently it screwed up

243
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,760
some other pieces inside the air speed indicator

244
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,760
I'm sure my sucking on the peto to might not have helped but that

245
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
doesn't seem to be the problem all the all the two

246
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
being is all fine for you pilots out there

247
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,760
so there's a very simple test you can do

248
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,760
in the air actually to see what the deviation is of your air

249
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,760
speed indicator basically you're going to fly into wind out of wind

250
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,760
and then you take the the differences in chopmen two and take two

251
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,760
percent difference whatever and you come up with

252
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,760
what you're what you're with the actual indicated air speed

253
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
should be and so it really is

254
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,760
indicating 10 to 15 knots too low

255
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,760
so once coming back to ferrox man I just

256
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,760
greased the runway because I basically just took the you know

257
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,760
just deducted those those knots

258
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,760
from the from the indicated air speed am I born you yet

259
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,760
it's just so happy to tell the story

260
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,760
but you know the whole reason why you know you're really careful

261
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,760
about seeing an air speed indicator drop down to 50 knots

262
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,760
because that's your stall speed and then basic it's not the

263
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,760
engine stalling but the the wings will actually stall and provide no

264
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,760
lift and you fall out of the air so it's a little

265
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,760
little another chapter in the in the page of aviation

266
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
and of course I call the wind commander about it and say they

267
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,760
oh dude you got to get this fix you say yeah sure no problem

268
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,760
you come on over it's not all that expensive to replace it

269
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,760
and we'll put a new one in next time you're over and I say what

270
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,760
can I just you know fly without the air speed indicators again

271
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,760
you know I still lots of birds flying around without an air speed

272
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,760
indicator which I guess is his way of saying you're an airman

273
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:40,760
okay then Saturday night Christina had a sleepover

274
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,760
maybe should say that to store I'll say that story for tomorrow

275
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,760
when Patricia's on uh it was a real parent moment

276
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,760
now I'll ask her to come on tomorrow and talk about that

277
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,760
now I have a couple of topics lined up for today's show

278
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,760
if you hear a Skype a bleep that's because I am monitoring what's

279
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,760
going on with uh with the server status right now

280
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,760
the first topic I wanted to just kind of pull together

281
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,760
is all the information that I've been collecting and you've been

282
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,760
sending me about this nasa footage that has been lost

283
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,760
and of course my I would have to say easy belief in you know the

284
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,760
fact easy belief that we may not have landed on the moon

285
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,760
so I've been receiving all kinds of amazing

286
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,760
just absolutely amazing links one was one thing I've put here

287
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,760
that I didn't actually put in

288
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,760
putting into my show notes now

289
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,760
I got this awesome link to a documentary a French documentary

290
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,760
which is an English made by French television company

291
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,760
I'm going to make sure to put a link to that in the show notes

292
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,760
I'm going to spoil it by telling you what's in it

293
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,760
but you know you got Alexander Hague in there

294
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,760
and Donald Rumsfeld and it will blow your mind about this whole

295
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,760
controversy but you've been talking about it as well

296
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
and I wanted to share some of the comments that have come in

297
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,760
hello Adam it's racist and you can

298
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,760
I'm sitting in traffic at the moment

299
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,760
I'm in my home just going to have a result

300
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,760
I'm sorry about that

301
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,760
I'm sorry about that

302
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,760
hold on a second

303
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,760
I'm sorry about that

304
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,760
let me I can't believe I can

305
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,760
I've done the wrong one in there

306
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,760
I'm so idiotic

307
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,760
okay try this

308
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,760
and it really does a great job

309
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,760
but

310
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,760
Adam this is Tom from Michigan

311
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,760
after these last couple of charles about the skepticism of the

312
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,760
Apollo landing had to leave a message

313
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,760
you know you're right that the grainy pictures don't prove that we went

314
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,760
but the grainy videos don't prove that we didn't go either

315
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,760
there's an overwhelming amount of scientific evidence out there

316
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,760
that we did actually land on the moon and we landed on the moon six times

317
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,760
and a great website to check out if you're interested or any of the listeners of the Charlie are interested

318
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,760
is www.dadestronomy.com

319
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,760
put together by a guy named Phillips Flight

320
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,760
I think that says it

321
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,760
he works with the astronomy department at Sonoma State University

322
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,760
as he says on his website

323
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,760
I'm an astronomer, a writer, a skeptic

324
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,760
I like reality the way it is and I aim to keep it that way

325
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,760
so he takes apart the

326
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,760
the skeptics and the

327
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,760
the conspiracy theorist series

328
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,760
point by point and he really does a great job at it

329
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,760
and really shows how their

330
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,760
so-called proof is not proof at all

331
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,760
and the fact that they lost the tapes

332
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,760
doesn't really prove they're hiding anything

333
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,760
it just proves they're another big government organization who doesn't know

334
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,760
the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing

335
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,760
and in this place the fact that they did that

336
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,760
really to me makes it more believable that they just bungled it

337
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,760
I mean how would they be able to keep six

338
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,760
landings quiet for 35 years

339
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,760
if this whole thing was a big conspiracy

340
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
now and it's just my two cents

341
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,760
love to show

342
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
an atom

343
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
folder

344
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,760
later

345
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
okay so I'll take it very seriously

346
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,760
I don't know that you're a folder

347
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
uh...

348
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,760
I totally reverse two segments on the show here I'm sorry as well I got messed up

349
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,760
so I thought long and hard about this in particular after seeing that that

350
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,760
documentaries about fifty minutes five zero

351
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,760
so you please take a look at this it's a it's a Google video so you can

352
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,760
pretty much watch it on anything and just click on the link in the show

353
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,760
notes

354
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
but I I

355
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,760
you know I really went through all of my thoughts about this over the weekend

356
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,760
you know and I don't necessarily think

357
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,760
that none of the moon landings might have happened

358
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,760
uh... it's just well here's the three pieces in the row that really

359
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,760
led me to my certainly initial conclusion first of all

360
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,760
the rumors

361
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
just like anybody else

362
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,760
where there's smoke there's fire you know you want to believe all the

363
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,760
all the nasty things you know it's very much like evil pod show

364
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,760
I'm sure you know there's so many people out there who hear rumors and

365
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,760
there's no conclusive evidence or proof of of

366
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,760
said evil doing you know

367
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,760
so they have a they draw conclusion rumors are that's what happens and some people

368
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,760
stick to their guns when it comes to that

369
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,760
and you can in its very easy to build your own truth certainly over time you know if you

370
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,760
have certain pieces of information which may or may not be fact

371
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,760
you can you can build your own truth in that

372
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
now secondly

373
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,760
is my my television background my broadcast experience you've probably seen

374
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,760
wag the dog with dust and Hoffman

375
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,760
same thing when I saw that movie is like yeah it's exactly how it can be done

376
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,760
and in fact as I told you I think on Friday I've been a part of a lot of

377
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,760
television illusions and trickery

378
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,760
not you know not necessarily bad or or meant with any malice

379
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
certainly meant for ratings

380
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,760
and television does that all the time now this was not for ratings but it's

381
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
highly believable that

382
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,760
the US government wanted to

383
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,760
you know have some kind of leg up on for instance the Russians

384
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,760
and again I refer back to this documentary it'll blow your mind

385
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,760
but when I really thought back to it my skepticism comes from one experience

386
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
and it kind of hit me

387
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,760
all of a sudden over the weekend when that when I was young

388
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,760
when I was young

389
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,760
I listen to the radio

390
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,760
I guess if only mama cast had any that ham sandwich

391
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Karen Carpenter had

392
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,760
Aunt Meg who is Uncle Don's wife and we'll talk about Uncle Don

393
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
in a second

394
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,760
we were I don't know because you know of course they live in in Washington

395
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,760
they took

396
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,760
I think we're probably about five or six

397
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,760
cousins

398
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,760
I don't remember why we were there with her but she took us to the Smithsonian Institute

399
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,760
and of course you know what I was most interested in

400
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,760
is the space exhibit so they had the capsule there

401
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,760
I think the Gemini

402
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,760
I don't know Gemini

403
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,760
I think that's the one and and

404
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,760
and that was it was almost disappointing

405
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,760
in fact that's where this is where it all started

406
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,760
I looked at that capsule like this this thing you know what happened to the

407
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
you know in my mind it was almost like

408
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,760
having listened to a

409
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,760
a radio and old fashioned radio drama

410
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,760
or even listening to a disjockey

411
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,760
on the radio and you have a certain image of someone

412
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,760
and then all of a sudden you see them

413
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,760
and it can really destroy your image of the show

414
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
if you see how a show is done that's why I don't like people taking

415
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,760
video or pictures of me doing a show because you have a certain image of that

416
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,760
that's the theater of the mind

417
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
and somehow this little

418
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
dinky thing which had

419
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,760
didn't have all the knobs and buttons I expected it to have

420
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,760
blinking lights and all the excitement it just wasn't there

421
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
and then they had the moon rock display

422
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,760
now that I look at that moon those moon rocks I went like

423
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,760
the crap is that man looks like a friggin rock

424
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,760
it's just rock

425
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,760
he went a lot of touch it or anything

426
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,760
I think even remember saying

427
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,760
I can't touch it I want to feel it

428
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,760
you know and of course my I think on Meg probably said

429
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
oh you know that could be contaminated

430
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
like that it was in glass

431
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
you couldn't have touched it even if I wanted to

432
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
and I think that's where this all came from

433
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,760
if you combine all of that throughout the years

434
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,760
and the rumors of course with the introduction of the internet

435
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,760
just grew stronger and stronger

436
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,760
I think that's what made my disbelief grow stronger

437
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,760
do I really technically believe

438
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,760
that all these landings would have been hoax is no

439
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
now I don't think that's possible

440
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,760
and quite honestly I hadn't even really

441
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,760
stopped to think about there being

442
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,760
it was at six or seven moon landings

443
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,760
so that's first one still possibly could have been

444
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,760
not hoax but it could have been oh man

445
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,760
I don't want to spoil this documentary for you

446
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,760
you're going to see it and you're going to understand

447
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,760
where I'm coming from so I think you've changed my opinion

448
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,760
without a doubt

449
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,760
is there nothing left there do we have to

450
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,760
readjust these reflectors

451
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,760
what I will do

452
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,760
and I'm actually thinking of planning a trip to New York

453
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
I want to talk to Uncle Don about it

454
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,760
because he was definitely around the administration

455
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,760
well right after Nixon

456
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,760
I'm not sure if he must have been doing something in there

457
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,760
around then but if not he knows all these guys

458
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,760
he knows Rumsfeld he knows Alexander Hague

459
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,760
so I'll just ask him who gave me a real-on stance

460
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,760
and of course I'm going to ask him about a lot of other things

461
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
including Korea

462
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,760
but what happened to the morning is a fantastic

463
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,760
fantastic story came out

464
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,760
I'm just going to click on the link here for you

465
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,760
which as always we'll be in the show notes

466
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
a daily source code dot com

467
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,760
this is really cool

468
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,760
the director of Pink Floyd's video clip

469
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,760
for dark side of the moon

470
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,760
Australian film producer Peter Clifton

471
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,760
in 1979 when he was making the movie

472
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,760
or making the video

473
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,760
he wanted to have some space footage

474
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,760
and so he contacted the Smithsonian Institute

475
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,760
and they sent him a tape

476
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
and he actually is a picture of him holding this tape

477
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
it's not like you know some wanky video tape

478
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,760
it's like a professional

479
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,760
I think it's a one inch B

480
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
what they call those BNC

481
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,760
or type C

482
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,760
a professional studio video tape

483
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
probably don't use those anywhere now

484
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,760
digital

485
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,760
so that's a proper proper copy

486
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,760
and so he essentially when he read or heard the story

487
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,760
about NASA losing the video tapes

488
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,760
how am I doing on time

489
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,760
when he heard all the story on television

490
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,760
he went to check the tape

491
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,760
and it turns out he has 30 minutes of footage

492
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,760
he only thought that there was just a couple of

493
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,760
just a couple of shots that he used for that video

494
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,760
but it includes the entire moon landing

495
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,760
so now there is apparently

496
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,760
a high quality copy of the moon landing footage

497
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,760
which I think if he's got that high quality

498
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
it wouldn't be awesome to put that out on the internet

499
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
now that we have it anyway

500
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,760
let's just do that

501
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,760
if anything it'll make this conversation

502
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,760
even more interesting

503
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,760
so

504
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,760
there you go

505
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,760
I have to say I'm pretty much on board

506
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,760
that we at least landed a couple times

507
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,760
maybe not that first time

508
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,760
and it doesn't really matter

509
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,760
it's been fun talking about it

510
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,760
for those of you listening to this podcast

511
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,760
on a serious stars 102

512
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,760
this is just the beginning of pod shows podcast line

513
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
up every single week afternoon

514
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
but if it coast hellway is next

515
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,760
now let me get back to

516
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,760
I'm gonna get back to some of the stuff we were talking about

517
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,760
in the comments that I wanted to play earlier

518
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
about

519
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,760
well it's a couple of topics locked into one

520
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,760
you know these terrorist threats in the UK

521
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,760
out

522
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,760
scared the shit I mean the door just slammed shut

523
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,760
so there's a couple of

524
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,760
topics interwoven here

525
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,760
one is about what kind of liquid bombs

526
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,760
can you take on an airplane

527
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,760
and the other one of course

528
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,760
has gotten into this

529
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,760
rather heated debate

530
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
certainly in comments at daily source code.com

531
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,760
about whether business class travel

532
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,760
subsidizes

533
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,760
economy class travel

534
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
or not

535
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,760
hello Adam it's racist

536
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,760
UK I'm sitting in traffic at the moment

537
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,760
but in my home

538
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,760
just go ahead

539
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,760
without you very well

540
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,760
and

541
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,760
I'd start laying out

542
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,760
on this thing too

543
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,760
a day before full floor

544
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
no

545
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,760
and he was talking about

546
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,760
this is trash

547
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,760
and that's the starting

548
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,760
economy class

549
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,760
that's certainly coming from on this

550
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,760
I agree

551
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,760
as to

552
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
out to the point

553
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,760
and I agree

554
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,760
for him

555
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,760
I just prefer

556
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,760
than

557
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,760
you're all the others

558
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,760
and they're the crisis

559
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,760
and they're not in the juice

560
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,760
but

561
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,760
to take them low cost

562
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,760
airlines in UK

563
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,760
and they've got

564
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
the easiest

565
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
right now

566
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,760
they're my baby

567
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
flyby

568
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,760
all those real cheap ones

569
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,760
they don't have a business class system

570
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,760
they only have

571
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,760
what happened

572
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,760
especially

573
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,760
have a company class

574
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,760
so let's see

575
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
how you're subsidizing

576
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
that

577
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,760
the crisis

578
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
they are the real cheap ones

579
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
don't know

580
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,760
so I think you get the idea

581
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,760
about what he's saying here

582
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,760
is

583
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,760
yeah you may

584
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
you may think you subsidize

585
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,760
economy class travel

586
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,760
but how about these

587
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,760
budget airlines

588
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,760
that don't have an economy class

589
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,760
well duh

590
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
I'm not talking about

591
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,760
all air travel

592
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,760
you know

593
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,760
I haven't seen a lot of real budget airlines

594
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760
flying from London

595
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,760
to San Francisco

596
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,760
these are short little hops

597
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,760
and they use the same plane

598
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,760
to turn around

599
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,760
and go back again

600
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,760
which has a lot of cons

601
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,760
and some pros

602
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,760
one the big pro

603
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,760
of course is price

604
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,760
and I've

605
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
travel with easy jet all the time

606
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,760
I never said

607
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
I subsidize

608
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,760
any of that

609
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,760
rather than just paying for my ticket

610
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,760
and showing up

611
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,760
but when it comes to

612
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,760
transatlantic flights

613
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,760
or flights that are not flown

614
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,760
in a

615
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,760
one class

616
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,760
there you go

617
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,760
in one class

618
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,760
operation

619
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,760
obviously you can't

620
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,760
subsidize it

621
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,760
but you know

622
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,760
the

623
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,760
the subsidize

624
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,760
subsidize

625
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,760
subsidization

626
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,760
I did it

627
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
comes from the fact

628
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,760
that the only

629
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,760
operated with one aircraft

630
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
so you can

631
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,760
have a significant delays

632
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,760
if the first

633
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
the first trip of the morning

634
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,760
doesn't go well

635
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,760
or if there's a hiccup

636
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
anywhere along the line

637
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,760
then it'll delay everything

638
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,760
the huge drawback

639
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,760
which doesn't work very well

640
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,760
for business travelers

641
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,760
and of course

642
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,760
there's no amenities

643
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
but these are usually

644
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,760
on very very

645
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,760
short flights

646
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,760
probably up to

647
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,760
you know

648
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
no more than

649
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
three and a half hours

650
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,760
four hours

651
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,760
something like that

652
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,760
or maybe

653
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
there must be a budget

654
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
airline from New York to LA

655
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,760
I'm sure there is

656
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,760
I'm sure

657
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,760
or jet blue whatever

658
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,760
is but you know

659
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,760
I think jet blue

660
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,760
is owned by

661
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,760
American

662
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
Delta

663
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,760
you know

664
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,760
so that there's all kinds of

665
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,760
subsidization going on

666
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,760
everywhere

667
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,760
but I think we pretty much

668
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,760
close that topic

669
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,760
a lot of people

670
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,760
sending me comments

671
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,760
and email

672
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
and I ask

673
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,760
I'm always to send

674
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,760
the to me an audio

675
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,760
but

676
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,760
they don't always do it

677
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
now about

678
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,760
about the explosives

679
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,760
that said terrorists

680
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,760
may have been planning

681
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,760
to bring on board

682
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,760
I've been trying to find out

683
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,760
not that I want to

684
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
make a

685
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,760
make some kind of explosive

686
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,760
device but

687
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,760
just like to know

688
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
is it really possible

689
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
you know

690
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,760
it isn't all the stuff

691
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,760
that can really

692
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,760
cause an explosion

693
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,760
isn't too

694
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,760
unstable

695
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,760
you know

696
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,760
to

697
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,760
to take along

698
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,760
and mix in the bathroom

699
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,760
or something like that

700
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,760
and this is

701
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,760
this is got some pretty interesting

702
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,760
feedback

703
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,760
hey I'm a chicken top

704
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,760
of the

705
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,760
six not just got

706
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,760
finished listening to the

707
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
DFC

708
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,760
I'm not a way to picture

709
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,760
there is a little bit

710
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,760
scary

711
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
so

712
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,760
be careful

713
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,760
using the

714
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
I can

715
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,760
also

716
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
at the car

717
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,760
just one of the

718
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,760
comment on

719
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,760
the

720
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,760
the

721
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,760
anarchist

722
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,760
cookbook

723
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
which you may have heard

724
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
I used to actually

725
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,760
check that out in the library

726
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
in my high school

727
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,760
but it had

728
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,760
like three different

729
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,760
sections on it

730
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,760
that

731
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,760
talked about

732
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,760
one of them was making

733
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,760
bombs and things

734
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,760
that's one of the things

735
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,760
you want to do

736
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
know about your show

737
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,760
and just reading that book

738
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,760
you can make a whole bunch of things

739
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
one of the things we used to do

740
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,760
was make a

741
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
calcium car

742
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,760
by bomb

743
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
when we were kids

744
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,760
now

745
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,760
we were kind of

746
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,760
gentle with it

747
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,760
we would take milk jugs

748
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
and drop calcium car

749
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
by but you could pick up

750
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,760
any

751
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,760
oh gosh

752
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,760
army navy store

753
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,760
things like that

754
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,760
calcium car by

755
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,760
a little rock

756
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,760
they put in the minors

757
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
elements to keep the light

758
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
going

759
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
among other things

760
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,760
but drop the rock in there

761
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,760
and we would take the cap

762
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,760
of the milk jug

763
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,760
and we drill a little

764
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,760
hole in it

765
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,760
and then get some fused

766
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,760
some like

767
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,760
similar to the fuses

768
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
so they could get wet

769
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,760
and put a little

770
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,760
dumb around them chips and gums

771
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,760
get the fused in there

772
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
seal it up

773
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
around the cap

774
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,760
then shake up

775
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
the mixture

776
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,760
a little bit

777
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,760
to build up the gas

778
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,760
and light the fused

779
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,760
and then it would

780
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
expand

781
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,760
the plastic of the milk jug

782
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,760
and it would make this big

783
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
fan

784
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
like a shotgun going on

785
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,760
now the version that was in the

786
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,760
anarchist cookbook

787
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,760
was to use something like a wine bottle

788
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
and you put a

789
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
a fused in the cork

790
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,760
and we did that only once

791
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,760
and we look a fused in ran

792
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,760
and hit behind a big piece of plywood

793
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,760
and the shards from that glass

794
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,760
shot so hard

795
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,760
that they actually went into the plywood

796
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,760
and on our side

797
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
there were pieces of the glass

798
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,760
starting to stick out

799
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,760
so it scared us so badly

800
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,760
we never did it again

801
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,760
but you said you wanted

802
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,760
some information on how to make

803
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,760
bombs easy

804
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,760
go check out the anarchist cookbook

805
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
it can be gathered up anywhere

806
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,760
there's also a little

807
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,760
chapter if I remember correctly

808
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,760
on how to make like

809
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,760
things with pots

810
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,760
like pots

811
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,760
beginning and pot brownies

812
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,760
and stuff like that

813
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,760
so hey

814
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,760
you know we're not in my pocket

815
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
um

816
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
did I say pot

817
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,760
cannabis

818
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
whatever you want to call

819
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
up

820
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
then also

821
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,760
just wanted to mention

822
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,760
whatever happened to your

823
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
it's your uncle

824
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,760
I thought you had somebody

825
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,760
who was in the services that would be a really good person to have on your show right now

826
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,760
and last night at least

827
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
I'm a scruncher

828
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,760
have a nice day

829
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,760
bye

830
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,760
all right so obviously not an endorsement

831
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,760
to go learn how to make

832
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,760
explosive devices

833
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,760
although I like the

834
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,760
the brownies part I might go check it out for that

835
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,760
all right so yeah that's possible

836
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,760
and I'm very familiar with carbide

837
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:01,760
I lived in kind of near farmlands for a long long time as a kid

838
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,760
about 20 miles south of Amsterdam

839
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,760
and we would we would take the the actual milk cans

840
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
the you know the big heavy metal

841
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,760
milk cans

842
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,760
and we throw some carbide in there

843
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,760
in fact we call them carbide cans

844
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,760
and you'd heat it up

845
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,760
to a certain you know on an open fire

846
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,760
or whatever

847
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,760
and you kind of point the can

848
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,760
and it would eventually would blow the top off

849
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,760
and of course it would blow at hundreds of hundreds of yards

850
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,760
it seemed like

851
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
or what I can remember

852
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,760
and of course you know this kind of stuff

853
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,760
absolutely is very dangerous

854
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,760
it won't blow up a plane

855
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,760
and it seems like it's a little tricky to detonate

856
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,760
and it just doesn't seem like the kind of PR

857
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,760
terrorists will be looking for

858
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,760
and you know there's a time factor in it

859
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,760
unless you have

860
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,760
I don't know how do you fit the iPod into the bottle

861
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,760
to detonate it

862
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,760
or maybe even I love this one

863
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,760
core core peaterson

864
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,760
sent in a email said

865
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
you know how about the old

866
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,760
Diet Coke and Mentos trick

867
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
yeah that would work too

868
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,760
all you need is a Diet Coke and some Mentos

869
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,760
and you too can explode at least something on the plane

870
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,760
so so far I'm pretty dissatisfied with what I've heard

871
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,760
although barren secia

872
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,760
I hope that's the right pronunciation

873
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,760
says he's got the solution to airline terrorism

874
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,760
it's really really simple

875
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,760
check this

876
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,760
get both the Shiite and a Sunni Muslim cleric to bless all airplanes

877
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,760
blessed

878
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,760
this is crazy

879
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,760
bless them in a way so it's clear that if a person causes harm to the aircraft

880
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,760
they don't pass go don't collect $200

881
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,760
and don't get their 42 virgins and they go straight to hell

882
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,760
it's either that or we have to fly in single-engine planes

883
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,760
like the Delta Sierra to minimize any terrorist attempts

884
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,760
yeah

885
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,760
no it's maybe not that crazy

886
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,760

five three

897
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,760
let me just play a couple of comments that came in over the weekend

898
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,760
hey Adam this is Audra

899
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,760
also you played my list of survey on show 440 so I played it for my girlfriend

900
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,760
of five and a half years

901
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,760
and yes that's correct

902
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,760
okay all right so you're a girl too I got it

903
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,760
and she said that I am just I'm hearing this for the second time

904
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,760
what is that I played this for my girlfriend to five years I think

905
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,760
what you're trying to say is you're getting

906
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,760
half years and yes that's correct

907
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,760
okay so you're a girl too I got it

908
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,760
and she said that I sound like a 12 year old boy so I was

909
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,760
wondering if you could maybe tweak it

910
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,760
change my voice a little bit so I sounded like one of those

911
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,760
sexy women that day all the guys who go over just because of their

912
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,760
voice so you could do that that'd be really cool

913
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,760
oh and can you have your people head on a word to

914
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,760
croncast that's crl and c a s t dot com

915
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,760
because that's one of the shows that I would do when I'm not listening to

916
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,760
the d i c I don't have my own podcast I'm just a

917
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,760
listener so I have to have to put my own listeners

918
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,760
shows anyway if they go to croncast they can tell that

919
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,760
I'll just send them and maybe we could both win

920
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,760
iPods because croncast is giving away iPods isn't everybody

921
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,760

922
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,760

924
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:02,760
okay well I'm happy to help but not with trickery

925
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,760
not with vocators and electronic gadgets

926
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,760
it's not about how you say it

927
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,760
well actually it is it's what you say and the intent behind it

928
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,760
so you know only have to do is is think sexy you can think sexy

929
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,760

930
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,760

absolutely first you know call back in and say something sexy

933
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,760
the way you say it to your girlfriend and slow down a little bit

934
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,760
and then naturally your voice will come down a little bit

935
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,760
and draw out your word somewhat call back and I'll write it

936
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,760

937
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,760
in real life and not just you know not just on the daily source code

938
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,760
I do want to help you speak sexy

939
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,760
oh and send me a naked picture please

940
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,760
hey Adam this is tap from Houston so I totally get the whole correlation

941
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,760
with some sail and burping

942
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,760
in fact I've made the transition from you bird by think

943
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:16,760
Nana coffee sure would be real good night now because my office didn't allow us to have some sail machines

944
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,760
I totally understand the correlation it's really great

945
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,760
what I don't get those the correlation with folding toilet paper or

946
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,760
the other day I sat down with the toilets take a crap and I thought

947
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,760
man I ought to listen to the daily source code

948
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,760
so just find a leave a comment and all the way

949
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
folder

950
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,760
well

951
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,760
I have to have to be honest with you this in sao thing was totally an experiment

952
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,760
and the folder scruncher thing I was done with it a long time ago

953
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,760
but people don't stop you just want to stop calling in about it

954
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,760
and if I played some of the stuff that people send in

955
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,760
you know we've gone totally away from the scrunching and folding and into all kinds of other things

956
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,760
that I'm not interested in I'm really not interested in all your personal habits

957
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,760
but the folding scrunching takes place before you do anything you know it's

958
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,760
it's a

959
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,760
I'm just interested in that and when I'm finding now indeed is that whenever people

960
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,760
and Patricia just yesterday that's last night she said

961
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,760
hunt it's official

962
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,760
I really am a folder

963
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,760
you know it's because now people are you know paying attention to these little things we do

964
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,760
on a daily basis

965
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,760
so and of course I love the fact that you know you're thinking of me and thinking of the show

966
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,760
that part is is

967
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,760
wow talk about

968
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,760
Vulcan mind tricks and getting people to

969
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,760
continuously think about the show and hopefully listen and

970
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,760
be part of the audience and interact and be involved

971
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,760
yes the next step I guess is

972
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,760
well I guess the next step is

973
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,760
getting into your dreams

974
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,760
maybe when you go to sleep and you know you know the old

975
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,760
count sheep thing

976
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,760
maybe you see little DSE logos jumping over a fence

977
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,760
doing touching goes

978
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,760
I hope I programmed you now

979
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,760
Hi Adam my name is Jason I'm a family physician

980
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,760
and Ohio I'm 35 years old

981
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,760
married two kids

982
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,760
give up the rest real radio just about a year ago actually

983
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,760
after reading an article in a wired magazine

984
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:30,760
that you had the interviewing you talking about podcasting

985
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,760
I got my first iPod

986
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,760
and the news is on there started listening to some podcast

987
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,760
ironically I didn't listen to yours until about a month ago when everyone on

988
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,760
podcast full on one

989
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,760
kept talking about how of course I listened to the

990
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,760
David source code period

991
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,760
I always think that

992
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,760
this kind of podcast was more for

993
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,760
people in the podcast and I listened to it

994
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,760
I realized it was in anybody who likes

995
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,760
good commentary and good music

996
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,760
and I really enjoy it and I'm a

997
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,760
David listener now

998
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,760
I

999
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,760
need to say that

1000
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,760
I am a folder

1001
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
I do teach a folder

1002
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,760
and I think really that's about the only way to go

1003
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,760
if you're scrunch of your missing coverage

1004
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,760
got to watch your hands afterwards

1005
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,760
just to get the crap off

1006
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,760
I watch my hands anyway

1007
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,760
be sure but

1008
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,760
don't like the crap on my hands

1009
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,760
always been a folder always will be

1010
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,760
thanks a lot Adam

1011
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,760
isn't it great to hear a family physician

1012
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,760
talk about not wanting crap on his hands

1013
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,760
yeah

1014
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,760
there was a thread over

1015
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,760
a podcast pickle which was

1016
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
which of course caught my eye

1017
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,760
daily source code has jumped

1018
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,760
the shark was the title of it

1019
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,760
that I no longer talk that much about podcasting

1020
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,760
and that a lot of people used to listen to it

1021
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,760
well yeah I mean before there was podcasting

1022
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,760
per se it was really technical

1023
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,760
and it was basically me getting feedback

1024
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,760
to developers

1025
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,760
who were creating eye potters

1026
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,760
eye potter lemon

1027
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,760
so you know of course my interest

1028
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,760
change things I'm talking about change

1029
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,760
I just did what I did like eight minutes

1030
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,760
about flying at the top of the show

1031
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,760
which you may not have liked

1032
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,760
and you could just fast forward

1033
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,760
right over if you want to

1034
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,760
but yeah I'm not interested

1035
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,760
in only talking about that

1036
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,760
and I've expanded

1037
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,760
a lot of podcasters

1038
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
you know don't listen anymore

1039
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,760
because they don't get the information

1040
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,760
they used to get out of it

1041
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,760
and then I'd interested in other things

1042
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,760
I have to say which is perfectly okay

1043
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,760
it's all right

1044
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,760
you know and hey you know if you want to stop listening

1045
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
stop listening you know you might come back

1046
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
you might not that's cool

1047
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
I used to have that with Howard Stern all the time

1048
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
after certain what you know he he going

1049
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
rants for weeks

1050
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,760
and as much as I like lesbians in the studio

1051
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,760
sometimes even I'm like okay

1052
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,760
I got to listen to something else

1053
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,760
and maybe I'd come back a couple weeks later

1054
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,760
certainly the best of stones

1055
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,760
I could rarely listen to those

1056
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,760
I like the whole live aspect

1057
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,760
and and I'm just saying that

1058
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
because that was a big influence

1059
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,760
on stuff that I'm doing now

1060
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,760
so

1061
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,760
yeah I'm interested in other things

1062
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,760
I'm interested in people other people

1063
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,760
talking about other things

1064
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,760
you know okay so it has to be for a folding and

1065
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,760
scrunching and it's folding and scrunching

1066
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,760
uh this is all a test

1067
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,760
nothing but a test

1068
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,760
every single piece of what we're doing here

1069
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,760
is a test you know it's all going to start

1070
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,760
melt together

1071
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,760
um even the whole concept of

1072
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
uh subscriptions

1073
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,760
well

1074
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,760
not the subscription but the the delay downloading

1075
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,760
that's going to go away so we're already seeing

1076
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,760
that disappear

1077
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,760
every device will be connected

1078
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,760
with high speed to to every piece of content

1079
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,760
you know it'll come in in real time

1080
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,760
what we used to call streaming

1081
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,760
it'll just be there you know

1082
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,760
this is what we're already seeing

1083
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,760
that's the pod said music network

1084
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,760
you know I don't have the whole library

1085
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,760
the pod said music network here

1086
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,760
at my

1087
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,760
at my fingertips you know

1088
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,760
I'm I'm getting that in real time

1089
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,760
from uh from the pod team music network

1090
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,760
it's completely feasible

1091
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,760
that I'll never have to download

1092
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,760
and load it up into cast blaster

1093
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,760
ever again in the near future

1094
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,760
I'll just select it from a list

1095
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,760
I want to click play

1096
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,760
it'll just play

1097
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,760
straight from whatever server

1098
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,760
wherever it's coming

1099
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,760
you know that stuff is going to happen

1100
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,760
and everything all lines are going to blur

1101
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,760
whether it's

1102
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,760
quote unquote mainstream content

1103
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,760
or not all the media companies

1104
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,760
and pod show is a media company

1105
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,760
um

1106
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,760
although I think we're approaching it from

1107
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,760
180 degrees in basically the opposite direction

1108
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,760
media companies will see this

1109
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,760
they'll change

1110
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,760
once uh

1111
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,760
the way advertising

1112
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,760
is is quantified and measured

1113
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,760
really changes we're already

1114
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,760
you know pushing that

1115
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,760
everyone's going to be everywhere

1116
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,760
so I want to I want to

1117
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,760
broad experience I really do

1118
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,760
if you got some other cool topics

1119
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,760
to talk about that I know nothing

1120
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,760
about or it would not think about

1121
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,760
bringing up let's do that

1122
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,760
it's totally your show

1123
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,760
in case you haven't noticed

1124
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,760
70% of the show

1125
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,760
is

1126
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,760
your your contributions

1127
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,760
I am this is Brad

1128
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,760
I do windows dot dot show dot com

1129
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,760
and I was calling about the Sebastian

1130
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,760
box story

1131
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,760
still haven't heard that story

1132
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,760
and you kind of peaked my interest

1133
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,760
I love the show

1134
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,760
I always listen and keep it up

1135
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,760
and I'm a holder

1136
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,760
so I uh

1137
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,760
I thought I'd already told the story

1138
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,760
and that's what I was kind of surprised

1139
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,760
that you sent that comment in

1140
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,760
and now I realize I told it a couple

1141
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,760
weeks ago on the um

1142
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,760
I love the 80s podcast

1143
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,760
who asked to interview me about the 80s

1144
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,760
which of course you know that was my

1145
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,760
certainly a huge high

1146
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,760
high point in my life in career

1147
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,760
was working at MTV

1148
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,760
so I'll put a link in the show

1149
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,760
notes of that particular episode

1150
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,760
I think they put it up last week

1151
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,760
maybe the week before

1152
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,760
and I actually tell the a couple of stories

1153
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,760
but also the Sebastian box story

1154
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,760
which took place in Moscow

1155
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,760
I realize I'm taking up a lot of your time already

1156
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,760
I'm going to play one more song at the end of the show

1157
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,760
of course another one that I've played before

1158
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,760
but first

1159
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,760
here's

1160
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,760
I really like this idea

1161
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,760
so I guess two or a group of girls

1162
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,760
have a podcast and they're promoting it

1163
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,760
and instead of sending a typical promo

1164
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,760
they're sending me a promo

1165
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,760
and individual riddles

1166
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,760
and on Friday I played the first riddle

1167
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,760
or maybe it was Thursday

1168
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,760
but at any rate today

1169
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,760
I've got the second piece of the puzzle

1170
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,760
and you know what?

1171
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,760
I'll just play along

1172
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,760
I think it's kind of cool

1173
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,760
The Adam O. Adam answers this

1174
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,760
Are you ready for the second clue

1175
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,760
with an express me for you?

1176
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,760
You won't be disappointed

1177
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,760
as you mentioned on show

1178
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,760
444

1179
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,760
these juicy riddles are a promo

1180
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,760
and perhaps a little bit more

1181
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,760
need certains aren't necessary for us to reveal

1182
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,760
that the missionists of our surgeon podcast

1183
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,760
and how they will make you feel

1184
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,760
Three words makes from 11 letters

1185
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,760
thus this mystery spell

1186
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,760
we hope you will figure it out

1187
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,760
because we may never tell

1188
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,760
Adam O. Adam

1189
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,760
we know you're a clever boy

1190
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,760
be at this your playground

1191
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,760
and podcasting your toy

1192
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,760
your goals, carefully measured

1193
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,760
and destination offset

1194
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,760
your concrete new territories

1195
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,760
all on our calculated bet

1196
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,760
with evidence you see as a new

1197
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,760
fly forth

1198
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,760
keen on selling podcasts

1199
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,760
the Wall Street

1200
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,760
as you seek their support

1201
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,760
Adam the Adam

1202
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,760
here's your second clue

1203
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,760
by the way we're being nice

1204
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,760
studying one clue for two

1205
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,760
use the first letter of the word

1206
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,760
that is spoken often of you

1207
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,760
just the old names of fly boys

1208
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,760
and the name of the popular movie

1209
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,760
too

1210
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,760
if you need help

1211
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,760
ask your listeners to make it easy for you

1212
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,760
TTFN

1213
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,760
okay

1214
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,760
I was writing along as that was

1215
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,760
coming down so three words 11 letters

1216
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,760
I believe now the first one

1217
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,760
the first word started with a P

1218
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,760
so I'm just going to say if we group that stuff

1219
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,760
it would probably be

1220
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,760
three I'm just going to take an average

1221
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,760
three letters for the first word

1222
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,760
four letters for the second word

1223
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,760
and three letters for the third word

1224
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,760
and the first word

1225
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,760
here's just roll that back

1226
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,760
what did she say now was

1227
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,760
a different word for fly boys

1228
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,760
or a popular movie

1229
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,760
that is spoken often of you

1230
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,760
spoke a word spoken often of me

1231
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,760
the old names of fly boys

1232
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,760
and the name of the popular movie too

1233
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,760
the old name for fly boys

1234
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,760
wow

1235
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,760
I'm not sure yet

1236
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,760
if you have any ideas you know how to get a hold of me

1237
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,760
send it to adamantpotshow.com

1238
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,760
or call it in plus one two zero one six two five six three five

1239
00:48:30,760 --> 00:49:00,760

1241
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:37,760
You can't show me something new on the door stand for me or him or her

1242
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,760
You're a super natural girl

1243
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,760
You're out of this world

1244
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:54,760
You're a super natural girl

1245
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:01,760
You're a super natural girl

1246
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,760
I ain't like

1247
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,760
With you too light

1248
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,760
You're a light

1249
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:27,760
You're out of sight

1250
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,760
You're a super natural girl

1251
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,760
You're a person

1252
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,760
You're a super natural girl

1253
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:52,760
You're a super natural girl

1254
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,760
You're a super natural girl

1255
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,760
You're out of this world

1256
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,760
You're a super natural girl

1257
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,760
Jimmy Golding you're a super natural girl

1258
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:22,760
And I guess I will have a link to that in the show notes as messages just coming now through on the instant message that the sights back up

1259
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,760
So the pots have music now works should be back up as well

1260
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,760
Apparently

1261
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:33,760
The trigger that was making this happen was an auto updateer

1262
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:39,760
At Rackspace that runs in the middle of the night and it apparently is screwing up a whole bunch of infrastructure for a lot of people

1263
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,760
Okay, so I guess we found the big problem

1264
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,760
Haven't actually resolved

1265
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,760
What it's doing but we can certainly pull that part out of the mix not haven't happened

1266
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,760
Cool, all righty

1267
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,760
Well that's it

1268
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,760
I'm done for today

1269
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,760
This afternoon Patricia and I are looking at another house here in Guilford

1270
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,760
Putting it in offer on yet a different one

1271
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,760
We'll try and get her on the show tomorrow and talk about husband and wife crafts

1272
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,760
By cast master

1273
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,760
Talk to you tomorrow everybody. Bye. Bye.

1274
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,760
Another pod show pod cast

1275
