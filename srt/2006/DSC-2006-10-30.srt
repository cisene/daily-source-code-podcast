1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is Delta Sierra Charlie for 8-7, off-deutch Fiat Zibon, Bavoski, Chitiria Vosimthium.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,640
Warning, if you have impression that Adam Kerry is in your head, then it is not an illusion

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,080
he actually is in your head.

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,160
In this situation, only one thing can cure you.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,600
The great taste of Splendaz Wittner.

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,600
It was $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,600
Then the next generation radio contenting my ears.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,600
I like to think I'm flying into this journey.

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Fantastic, it's Adam Kerry.

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,600
It's my day.

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,600
It was a car of setting sun.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,600
There was a car couch.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,600
There was a car couch.

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,600
There's a gig on my shower.

15
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,600
It was all this this.

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,600
All these things that I wanted me wasn't somewhere

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,600
You were around the wheel and I let it turn

18
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,600
We'll give everything

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,600
We will y'all like no one's been here for

20
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,600
You were queen and I was king

21
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,600
Yeah, no one's ever left me wrong

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,600
So if that gets to that dream

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,600
I can see what it is I'm waiting for

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,600
You'll be coming through my door

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,600
That's why I'm waiting for

26
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,600
If you come into my door

27
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,600
There was a weather rush

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,600
It was as fast as I could run

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,600
It was a switchback

30
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,600
I couldn't keep myself from coming under

31
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,600
It was all these things

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:23,600
All these things that I wanted me to learn

33
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,600
You were around the deck and I let it turn

34
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,600
We'll give everything

35
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,600
We will y'all like no one's been here for

36
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,600
You were queen and I was king

37
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Yeah, no one's ever left me wrong

38
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,600
So if that gets to that dream

39
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,600
I can see what it is I'm waiting for

40
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,600
You'll be coming through my door

41
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,600
That's why I'm waiting for

42
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,600
If you come into my door

43
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,600
That's why I'm waiting for

44
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,600
If you come into my door

We will y'all like no one's been here for

Yeah, no one's ever left me wrong

53
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,600

I can see what it is I'm waiting for

00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,600
You'll be coming through my door

That's why I'm waiting for

59
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,600
You'll be coming through

60
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,600

That's why I'm waiting for

67
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Mould doing rules

68
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,600
to the band, whiplash, on the pot safe music network.

69
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Damn, nice way to kick off the week.

70
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Everybody, how you doing?

71
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Welcome to the Daily Source Code episode 487

72
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
as expertly introduced by Comics Dream Blogger.

73
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Coming to you from Curry Cottage,

74
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
in the affluent suburb of Surrey,

75
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
known as Gilford, it's very busy.

76
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Told you all these weeks are going to be busy.

77
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
How you doing?

78
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
How you doing? I had a great weekend.

79
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Of course, you know what I did Friday, right?

80
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,600
The solo channel crossing Saturday, a big shoot day

81
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,600
in the Potcho UK shortage office.

82
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Yes, the trendy shortage office, which is,

83
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,600
I think shortage is the new so-how, is it not?

84
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,600
It's very urban, very crumbly,

85
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
but it's the place to be.

86
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,600
And that's where we've got our office slash studio,

87
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,600
doing a lot of promo shoots and stuff,

88
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
getting ready, ramping up for the big launch,

89
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
week of November for Potcho, BT Potcho.com,

90
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Potcho UK essentially, which very excited about.

91
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,600
We had OJ there, not that OJ.

92
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,600
OJ UK, I guess we'll call him from now on.

93
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
I hope you might have seen it London Live,

94
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
which we did from the roundhouse during the digital

95
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
musical awards Olivia,

96
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,600
and Dr. Cockney.

97
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,600
So it was, yeah, it was quite the mess.

98
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,600
I'll have to say, but it was great.

99
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,600
I'm really looking forward to this launch.

100
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
It's going to be fantastic.

101
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
And then, I'm still pushing.

102
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,600
I'm still pushing to be at PodcastCon UK on the 18th.

103
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
I'm hoping that I can stay the 18th

104
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,600
and then fly off the San Francisco on the 19th.

105
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
And then, let's see, yes,

106
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,600
so they did some more flying training,

107
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
actually, only a couple hours with Captain Dan.

108
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Now that I've, you know,

109
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
now that I've got my bridge is a little bit bigger.

110
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
My bridge is arbed.

111
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Now that I fit into my bridge is,

112
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,600
I guess, after the channel, the channel solo crossing,

113
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,600
he took me out for some unusual landing circumstances,

114
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,600
which means crosswind, tailwind,

115
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,600
believe me, you really don't want tailwind

116
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,600
when you're landing for us me on the one.

117
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,600
But also a flatless landing.

118
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,600
So if in case you would have an electrical failure,

119
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
then you still have to be able to land the plane,

120
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
which is not that hard to do.

121
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
You just come in a little bit faster.

122
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,600
And then, of course, an engine off emergency landing.

123
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
So good workout.

124
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
I think we did.

125
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
We flew down to Goodwood.

126
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,600
And everybody loves Goodwood, don't you?

127
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
That's a Chichester airport,

128
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
which is really nice.

129
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,600
They've got three runways, all grass,

130
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,600
all bumpy, all messed up, and plenty of traffic.

131
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
So that was good.

132
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Hey, Saturday night,

133
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
so we're just chilling out.

134
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,600
After I got back from from the shortage offices.

135
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,600
And all of a sudden, boom, big explosion fireworks.

136
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,600
And of course, we are the foreigners here.

137
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
So I couldn't quite figure it out.

138
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,600
But I have been told that this was a bonfire night.

139
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,600
And this is for Guy Fox Day.

140
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Now, I'm going to paraphrase the way it was explained to me.

141
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,600
In 1700, something, a rather.

142
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,600
There was a guy, I think named Guy Fox,

143
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,600
who tried to blow up Parliament,

144
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
the English House of Parliament.

145
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,600
And he came just inches away from doing it,

146
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,600
but was thwarted.

147
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,600
And they celebrate that here in the UK.

148
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,600
With bonfire night on Guy Fox Day,

149
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,600
by blowing shit up and having huge bonfires.

150
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Which, of course, I'm all for.

151
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,600
I just wish I'd received an invitation, you know?

152
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
I had him.

153
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
This is Andrew Kerr.

154
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,600
I've listened to from a few miles north of Oxford in the UK.

155
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,600
As we're getting near and near at Sioux, bonfire night.

156
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,600
So I've always wanted to do a fireworks night.

157
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
It would be up in the air and sea.

158
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Or fireworks in the bonfire night, not from the air.

159
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,600
I just wonder if that's something you'd ever done or considered doing.

160
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Or even if, you know, you're allowed to fly like aircraft at night.

161
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,600
In the UK, I don't know if you're a clumpy and drunk smuggler.

162
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Or something like that.

163
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
But anyway, I'm back.

164
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,600
I've always had to do a sea of fireworks from the air.

165
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
It's been a folder.

166
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm not going to show you again.

167
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Bye.

168
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
Yeah.

169
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
I think if you're Colombian drug smuggler flying around

170
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
at night, you're very lost.

171
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
You've got the wrong route.

172
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Yeah, of course you're allowed to fly at night.

173
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
The question is, where can you land at night?

174
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Ferrokes closes at dark.

175
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Most airfields close at dark.

176
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
But I am also licensed to fly at night.

177
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
As long as it's under visual flying rules condition,

178
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,600
I can actually see the ground and see what the heck I'm doing.

179
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,600
The problem would be where to land.

180
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
So it could be done.

181
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
It could go to farm bro or one of the other places.

182
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
But a lot involved.

183
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,600
And if I had known about it, I actually might have set that up.

184
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Because yeah, of course, of course you can, you can fly.

185
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
I don't think these fireworks go up to 1500 feet.

186
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
I sure hope they don't.

187
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Who knows anything about fireworks?

188
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,600
So on fortsite didn't get to your voice mail on time.

189
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Otherwise, I might have actually considered trying to set that up.

190
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
So let me give out the voice mail number early then.

191
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Plus one 201 625 635 7 or as you can sing along with the jingle.

192
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,600
And I'm got to tell you man, a life saver.

193
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,600
Living here in Italy for last 12 years.

194
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,600
This channel on the network thing that you put on the other day.

195
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,600
That's always charged as they are.

196
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Man, now I can watch American television and get away from this incredibly bad Italian.

197
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Going to rock and the stock.

198
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Air sea television that really sucks.

199
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Soon the sister knows about this also.

200
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
So great thanks for the tip.

201
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
And fuller.

202
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Yeah, the TV unit works thing is pretty cool.

203
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
And I forgot to put a link in the show notes last time.

204
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
But it did show up in comments.

205
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
I forgot to post that.

206
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
But I do appreciate it.

207
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
TV unit works dot com.

208
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,600
This is a appeared appear based streaming video application.

209
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,600
And what they've done is they've hooked it up to I guess a cable box somewhere.

210
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,600
In San Francisco because you can get ABC, NBC, CBS.

211
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
You can get Fox.

212
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,600
You can get Comedy Central.

213
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,600
In fact, here's a little tip for you all.

214
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
A tip from the pod father.

215
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,600
If you install this TV unit works, which of course will only work on windows.

216
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,600
When you quit the application, make sure that you quit the little system tray application to for two reasons.

217
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,600
One, you'll continue to be appear on the network and you may not want to do that.

218
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Although I'm happy to leave it open when I'm not using my bandwidth.

219
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
I don't care anyone else can use it.

220
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,600
But it was was this.

221
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,600
This was sometime early last week around 4 a.m. all of a sudden.

222
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,600
This racket, you know, in the middle of the night.

223
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
And Patricia really freaked out.

224
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
She's like, what's going on?

225
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
And she jumps out of bed.

226
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,600
And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

227
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,600
And what it happened was even though I'd close the application.

228
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
I left the system tray thing running.

229
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,600
And for some reason, it decided to start playing Comedy Central.

230
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
It was the Johnston show.

231
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Very loudly coming from the studio B.

232
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Which of course is located right next to the master bedroom.

233
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Our bedroom.

234
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
So that's just a little tip.

235
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
You might want to quit that.

236
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,600
If you don't want or turn the volume down in case something funky goes wrong with that application.

237
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
But I have to agree.

238
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
It's fucking cool.

239
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,600
I wish they had an east coast feed as well because, you know,

240
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
the eight hours time difference.

241
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Actually, what is it now?

242
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Seven hours time difference has the US fallen back an hour yet.

243
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,600
We got an extra hour of Saturday through Sunday here in the UK.

244
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,600
So I think I only have what now.

245
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Like four hours difference with the east coast and seven hours difference with the west coast.

246
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Very nice.

247
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,600
You probably noticed, if you listen to East radio,

248
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,600
that Madge has been gone for several weeks.

249
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,600
And quite frankly, I wonder if Madge is coming back at all.

250
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Richard Bluestein has been hosting the show.

251
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,600
I was Richard Bluestein, which kind of up in the I like Richard.

252
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
I like the way he does the show.

253
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,600
But I have to tell you honestly, I really do miss Madge.

254
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,600
And there are more people who miss Madge.

255
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
This is now the political season.

256
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,600
We are just about a little over a week away from politics and people getting very involved.

257
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,600
Well, the attack ads are already coming out.

258
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Because you could, of course, choose from Madge Weinstein.

259
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,600
You could vote for her if she were not in the hospital and were back on the podcast.

260
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,600
Or you could consider Cheryl.

261
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
But it's getting nasty.

262
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
The attack ads are out.

263
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,600
The soldiers dying every day, fighting for freedom.

264
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,600
What kind of person when champion the rights and freedoms of the downtrodden?

265
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Yes, the kind with a badge of woman named Madge.

266
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Madge Weinstein of East radio.com would have voted against the angelic clump of cells

267
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,600
that will one day become a beautiful cognitive capitalist system.

268
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,600
She would have voted against the effective and cost-conscious program that prevents the murder of unborn children

269
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,600
and could spend a little education and health care for the already-burned children.

270
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Madge would have voted for pedaling, smut and graphic descriptions of lesbian, fisting and homosexual punchfucking.

271
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Calling you to arts that it reaches the undeveloped ears of fetuses.

272
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Madge says she cares about East more than cancer.

273
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Even though she herself has lost a breast to the cancer.

274
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Don't you want a candidate that can stand up for the right to be wrong and can tell you.

275
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,600
They are an elemental hospital instead of making up lies about being the undisclosed hospital in Mexico.

276
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,600
Don't you want someone that has lost something more important to cancer than a breast?

277
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Maybe one in a fourth of a long?

278
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,600
Sheryl and Macau scheme is a smoky woman of honesty.

279
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,600
A woman not afraid to be four of the children in every sense of the word.

280
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,600
Madge would have believed that Sheryl is only about making creepy sounds and low production quality.

281
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,600
But using her popping others when she exerts the effort to please her own listeners.

282
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,600
Maybe if Madge were not so lazy, actually puts an effort into her own program, maybe then.

283
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,600
She could stop attacking such a beautiful and lovely people like Sheryl and Macau scheme.

284
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Madge will refuse to take part in something simple and principal, even if the principal is retarded or self-serving.

285
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Sheryl is a complete horror, and will do whatever she wants, especially if so, doing will benefit her.

286
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Would you rather vote for an elderly, lying lesbian fetus murderer or a beautiful 25-year-old woman,

287
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,600
smoke her and honor three-fourths of a long and lover of all children aboard her not?

288
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Voting for Madge lets the terrorists win.

289
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Voting for Madge is anti-freedom anti-children and just downright wrong and immoral.

290
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,600
A vote for Sheryl is a vote for the children.

291
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Freedom honesty, everything right in the world and beautiful.

292
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,600
If Madge wants in her better priorities, you want to be having to hear those.

293
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,600
This election season, exercise your rights by supporting the children and visiting her whole daughter.

294
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,600
I'm Sheryl Macau scheme, I have approved this message. I'm nay.

295
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Payed for my whole daughter work.

296
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,600
I should have warned you about that one beforehand, I guess.

297
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Truly disturbing. I have no idea what it's about.

298
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,600
But I do mismatch, that's for sure.

299
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,600
I've got a hurry up today going into the city staying in the city this evening.

300
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,600
We have early morning meetings in presentation. I told you it's really ramping up, getting real busy.

301
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:38,600
But I have been quite busy with home base with Brian Longest, who is our director of operations as well as he is also a lawyer.

302
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Don't hold it against him.

303
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:59,600
And we've reached out to the appropriate organizations and we have started down the path of arranging certain performance licenses under certain restricted conditions for something very important, very dear to my heart and I think to yours as well.

304
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,600
I'm proud of you casting with Adam Curry.

305
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Adam, are you ready to be stumps?

306
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Bring it on.

307
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,600
He's back, everybody.

308
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Adam, this is hit test number 70 on the daily source code.

309
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:24,600
According to all the emails and other responses to the last weeks, he tests the one time return of the hit test in the daily source code.

310
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,600
It's still very popular, so hopefully this can occur more often.

311
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:35,600
And of course, that all depends on the possible licensing agreement, so hopefully you can tell me more about that.

312
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,600
In me time, there's a hit test, three intros and three answers and this is intro number one.

313
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
What the fuck is that?

314
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Oh, what happened?

315
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Oh man, what is this?

316
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Oh shit.

317
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
It's over?

318
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
No, no, no, this can't be right.

319
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Hold on a second, something.

320
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Oh shit.

321
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Don't tell me it only got like partially downloaded.

322
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Oh no, and I deleted the original.

323
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,600
No, no, no, no, no.

324
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,600
Oh crap.

325
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
I can't.

326
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Hold on a second, let me see.

327
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
I'm so sorry about this.

328
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Hold on a second.

329
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Let me.

330
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Oh, I suck.

331
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Does Jan have the new one up yet?

332
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Crap.

333
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
I can't believe that.

334
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Well, just goes to show.

335
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
I don't cheat.

336
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
I don't listen to it beforehand.

337
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
I'm so sorry.

338
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
I was so fucking ready for that.

339
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Crap.

340
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
All right.

341
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
I'm sorry.

342
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
I'm a loser.

343
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
I'll have to have Jan resend it.

344
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
I don't know.

345
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Maybe he got mulched on his end or mulched on my end.

346
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
And I didn't even get the first one.

347
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Sorry about that.

348
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
Crap.

349
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
That really harsh is my mellow.

350
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
All right, then.

351
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Adam says, Edgar.

352
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
I'm a folder in a long time.

353
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,600
I want to be Mac user.

354
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
I love Macs.

355
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Ever since 1996 when I first worked on a Mac.

356
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
I wanted that little machine in 1997.

357
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
I was working as Webmaster and ISP.

358
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Had a performer in Windows and T.

359
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Now I'm wondering, what does that make me buy?

360
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,600
I cannot afford a Mac and my old to Shiba is almost six years old.

361
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
But I'm back at the university.

362
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,600
They're only IMAX.

363
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,600
There's more people wondering about this correlation between folders,

364
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Macs, scrunchers, windows, and there's more.

365
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
Hello, Adam.

366
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Yes.

367
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,600
This whole thing about Mac users and Windows users,

368
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
whether they're folder, scrunchers.

369
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
I have to have an idea.

370
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
Or it's, well, not an idea about.

371
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Some thought.

372
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
What do Linux users do?

373
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
Are they all folders or scrunchers?

374
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
They can?

375
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
You know, I use these books for a while.

376
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
I'm going to get into our PC.

377
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Well, that's when I use this book.

378
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
I've got the moment.

379
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,600
So, won't go to do it with this PC.

380
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
It's a good insight.

381
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,600
And I both fold and scrunch.

382
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Is it the same with all my users?

383
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Oh, my God.

384
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Oh, my God.

385
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
We're on stuff.

386
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
Yeah.

387
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
I'm talking something quite random.

388
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,600
It's an imaginary cigarette.

389
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Oh, what the fuck?

390
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Anyway, Adam.

391
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,600
I'll call you back later one day.

392
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Bye.

393
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Yeah, please do.

394
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,600
When you figured it out, what Linux users do?

395
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
I don't know, man.

396
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Those of you, uh, hoping to hear the lady Patricia,

397
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,600
we had it all planned out.

398
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,600
But then, of course, uh, I came up with the announcement

399
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
that I had to record really early earlier than normal.

400
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
And she said, well, that's exactly the same time.

401
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
I just put my hair on point then.

402
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
We don't have to be a node.

403
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
It's under time.

404
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
It's not like you.

405
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Hi.

406
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,600
This is Lauren from Seven Stories Podcast.

407
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Come to sevencast.potshow.com to hear some of our great interviews

408
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
with Jeff Smith.

409
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Do you lean one way or the other?

410
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Mmm, let's say boxers.

411
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
No briefs.

412
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Uh, or, uh, one of my doing tonight.

413
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
Boxer briefs.

414
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,600
Matthew evil.

415
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,600
You have been described as the love child of Billy Joel and

416
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
Elton John.

417
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,600
I think that's my favorite quote so far.

418
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,600
How's that for a, uh, uh, an image that you won't be able to get

419
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
out of your head?

420
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
How that's created.

421
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Uh, me up the other night.

422
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Isn't that a fact?

423
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Well, all it takes is some soft music and two superstars

424
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,600
and a bottle of red and a bottle of white, you know.

425
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
There you go.

426
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
I have a port.

427
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
These are the nerds.

428
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Not us.

429
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
We're, we're doing stuff that's important.

430
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
It's making a difference.

431
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
It's changing the world.

432
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,600
We're inventing stuff that is making a huge difference.

433
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
They're just playing games.

434
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
So I don't, I no longer, you know,

435
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
I don't feel like we were the nerds in high school.

436
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,600
They were the nerds.

437
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Uh,

438
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,600
And Cali and Neil from Geek brief TV.

439
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,600
She thought I joined a camp because I kept talking about what

440
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
Adam said.

441
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Adam said that.

442
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
Yeah.

443
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
He started listening before I did.

444
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,600
And he was always talking about Adam this and I'm,

445
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Who is Adam?

446
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
I was, I'm too younger.

447
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
Well, maybe not too young.

448
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,600
But I didn't grow up knowing who Adam Curry was.

449
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
Mm-hmm.

450
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,600
And just this craziness I'm thinking,

451
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
Who is he?

452
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,600
And what is he doing now in your life?

453
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,600
And don't forget to subscribe

454
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
because they're more on the way.

455
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Join us on the web at Seven Stories.

456
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
That's me.

Seven Stories.

458
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,600
Let's go our story.

459
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,600
That's cute.

460
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Listen, I got to listen to that.

461
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Now that I hear that Cali is talking about me.

462
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,600
I didn't know Neil was in love with me first before Cali.

463
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
Crap.

464
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
Ah, Neil.

465
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,600
Uh,

466
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Sounds a little bit like a show.

467
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,600
We've got going on here, which we'll launch with pod show UK as well

468
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,600
at bdpodshow.com as who's on it,

469
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
which highlights podcasters,

470
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,600
podsive music stars, et cetera,

471
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,600
not just from the UK also from the US obviously,

472
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
but it's a new format that's we're trying out.

473
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
Pretty excited about it.

474
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
On the clever little pod Halloween special,

475
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
we dine out with zombies.

476
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
Uh, this is Herman.

477
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,600
Uh,

478
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Vernon and Dave.

479
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Man.

480
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Now, let me get this right.

481
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Herman, you want it flat.

482
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Uh, Vernon, you said flesh thing you've made.

483
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Dave?

484
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
You sure you want the cod?

485
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Mmm.

486
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
It's full of bones.

487
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Yeah, I think so.

488
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Three types of flesh, please.

489
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
And for you, sir.

490
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
And just a green salad, thank you.

491
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,600
It's all on iTunes,

492
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Brickcaster, and it clever little pod.com.

493
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Like, come on, Scoop.

494
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,600
It's Delta Sierra Charlie 47.

495
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Ah.

496
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Random worry.

497
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
Are you a blogger?

498
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,600
A hotcaster, video blogger, web 2.0 programmer.

499
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Are you a marketing or PR type?

500
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Citizen journalist.

501
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,600
The center of your online social network.

502
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,600
And you'd be in San Francisco, November 9th and 10th.

503
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
Rainjams, social media club,

504
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600
the social media cast,

505
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,600
and a group of intelligent and good-looking sponsors,

506
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
want you to join us for web 2.2.

507
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,600
With the same people who brought you the web 2.1 event last year.

508
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,600
Web 2.2 is an uncomference.

509
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,600
Down the block from that other web 2 conference.

510
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,600
They're charging $3,295 in vitally.

511
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,600
Or is only $32,95 and everyone's welcome.

512
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
You can help us create our own agenda.

513
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,600
Two days of intelligent discussion about the growth of the net,

514
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
social media, identity, disclosure,

515
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
word of mouth marketing, and more.

516
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,600
Now work with some great people,

517
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,600
and did I mention we're going to have an awesome party.

518
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
Check web 2.2.org.

519
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
That's web.

520
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,600
The number two,

521
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
heoint2.org.

522
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
The point is people.

523
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,600
November 9th and 10th in San Francisco.

524
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,600
I got to thank Peter because I know that he was just able to squeeze

525
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,600
that into the satellite window in Syria stars 102.

526
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,600
We were preempted.

527
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Wednesday Thursday and Friday for a whole bunch of chick shows.

528
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
And that we're back on the air now.

529
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
All right.

530
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
It's going to be tough.

531
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,600
I think to get a show out early tomorrow.

532
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
I'll probably have to do it when I come home late.

533
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
And we've got a lot of stuff to do tomorrow night.

534
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
We have a pod save the queen.

535
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
Christina wants to do.

536
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,600
She's ready again.

537
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Of course she uses it.

538
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
This is a tough year for her.

539
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,600
This is a very important, very important school year.

540
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,600
And from here, after this, she goes to what they call the UK college.

541
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
That's before you go to university.

542
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,600
So she's really been doing a lot of her course work.

543
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,600
She's really hitting the books pretty hard.

544
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
Last minute, of course, you know.

545
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
It's a tradition in the family.

546
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
But she's really working it.

547
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
So for her to squeeze that in, it's pretty cool.

548
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
And we're also going to do a B.G.

549
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
Blast.

550
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
What's it?

551
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Episode 7.

552
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,600
I think in which she announces the winners of the hollow screen contest.

553
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,600
Who gets an all expenses paid trip to Bush Gardens.

554
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,600
Now, since the hit test messed up.

555
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,600
And of course, the next opportunity I have, I'll bring you that one.

556
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,600
I feel so stupid about this.

557
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,600
I mean, maybe just didn't download completely from Gmail or something.

558
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,600
And then, you know, to save space after I've received it, you know, a big attachment.

559
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,600
I deleted it.

560
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,600
So it's now gone.

561
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,600
And I emptied the trash as well on my Gmail.

562
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
So it is definitely gone.

563
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,600
It's something else I want to do here.

564
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
Let me see.

565
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
This is a member Joseph Jaffee.

566
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,600
Bend over bitch.

567
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,600
He was in New York as I told you when I was on my panel with a chat.

568
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,600
And from YouTube and Chris from my space.

569
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,600
And he talked about it in his most recent podcast across the sound.

570
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
Let me see if I can find it.

571
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:34,600
I just wanted to play this bit for you because I thought I was pretty funny.

572
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,600
I see what's being completely honest and open.

573
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
It's only Joseph can be.

574
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Here we go.

575
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,600
Being wanting to meet.

576
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,600
And it was just an amazing, amazing experience.

577
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
Just to kind of admit more people.

578
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
I admit.

579
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
I admit.

580
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Help me.

581
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
I've got a link.

582
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
What about who you are?

583
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
Get to my part.

584
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
I remember your name.

585
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
And that's going to come to me.

586
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,600
It always does.

587
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
Come on.

588
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Jeff Bukett.

589
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
Thank you.

590
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
What a right.

591
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Another.

592
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
It's the sound.

593
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,600
And by the way, it's no a person that I wanted to tell you about it.

594
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,600
You can tell this is completely honest.

595
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
Right.

596
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,600
So it was a terrific day.

597
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
And then I got to be honest.

598
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,600
I was invited by my friend Sean Finnegan.

599
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,600
Here we go.

600
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,600
That's all of digital for OMD.

601
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,600
The real, I mean, the tipping point for me, the reason I went was to meet Adam Curley, who

602
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,600
was there for the first time.

603
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,600
And I was a little disappointed because I arrived late.

604
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
I was leaving on mono's event.

605
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,600
I arrived only to hear the final 10 or 50 minutes of a panel that Adam was on with Chad

606
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Hurley from YouTube.

607
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
Someone from my space.

608
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
Some muckily mucked my space.

609
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
I didn't know who he was.

610
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,600
You know, just clearly didn't remember his name either.

611
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,600
I think much autumn memory is definitely going quickly.

612
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,600
But I heard Adam at the back end of the panel.

613
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,600
And disappointed it only in the sense that I didn't hear the whole panel.

614
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,600
And also I just very briefly went up and met him and Ron Bloom.

615
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
Just shook his hand.

616
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,600
He is a tall, tall mother fucker.

617
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
Let me tell you.

618
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,600
This guy could have taken up basketball.

619
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,600
A long time ago and been pretty good at it.

620
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
He's a very good looking guy.

621
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,600
He's sent the props back to me originally about my looks.

622
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,600
And I want to return the favour. He's a very good guy.

623
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,600
And when he sort was me, he smiled and just said to

624
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Very precious words.

625
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
Bend over.

626
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,600
That was good meeting you two, Joseph.

627
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,600
You couldn't check out Joseph at across the sound.com.

628
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
A dot net, sorry.

629
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
One last song for the start of this week.

630
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
Brand new Matthew Ebel every color.

631
00:28:41,600 --> 00:29:09,600
I was kind of blind and standing.

632
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,600
I thought that all that I was handed

633
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Was all that I was to see

634
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,600
All I had was just this pencil

635
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,600
You saw me sticking a grey

636
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,600
And I've been living in this pencil

637
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,600
But I'm breaking out today

638
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,600
There's another very colour

639
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:41,600
And I've every colour

640
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,600
And I've every colour

641
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,600
And I've every colour

642
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,600
I think that's for the right

643
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,600
Is that I've every colour

644
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,600
Not just regular white

645
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,600
Blank white paint when it feels so bright

646
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,600
I'll light it outside the light

647
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,600
You give me a bite of sunlight

648
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,600
With every shade cast

649
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,600
Hold around and I'm unstable

650
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,600
But I don't really care

651
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,600
World's not spinning now when I'm stable

652
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,600
Kind of everywhere

653
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,600
Is that I've every colour

654
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,600
And I've every colour

655
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,600
And I've every colour

656
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,600
The rainbow what a false

657
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,600
And I've every colour

658
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,600
Stayed fast from the light

659
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Is that I've every colour

660
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,600
Not just regular white

661
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:17,600
I've every colour

662
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,600
Is that I've every colour

663
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Is that I've every colour

664
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,600
And I've every colour

665
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,600
The rainbow what a false

666
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:49,600
Oh, it's entertaining, Matthew Ebel.

667
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,600
I love every color from the pod save music network.

668
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,600
You can find it at link in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

669
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,600
Okay, got to get out of here, get the show up on the pdn,

670
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,600
and then off, as I said, to London tomorrow morning.

671
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,600
You know, just as cable networks now are offering telephony service,

672
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:12,600
so you can get your television, your internet, and your telephone from,

673
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,600
and I guess also your mobile is, don't they connect that all into one account?

674
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,600
You know, that's what now the cable companies are doing.

675
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,600
So you see, of course, the, with the deregulation or pending deregulation,

676
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,600
which is pretty much happening around the world telephone companies or telcos

677
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,600
or now getting into delivery of video because they can.

678
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,600
And they, and of course, if you look at British telecom,

679
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,600
they have the proper network in place to actually make something called IPTV work.

680
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,600
So the question is, you know, what are they going to show on their set-top box?

681
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,600
Well, that's what we're talking about tomorrow.

682
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,600
It's, you can imagine that we got some pretty big ideas for those guys.

683
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,600
So I'll keep you in the loop on that, and talk to either tomorrow afternoon

684
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,600
or early Wednesday, but I'll get four shows done this week.

685
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,600
I promise, that's for sure.

686
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,600
Take care, everybody.

687
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Adam and pod show.com.

688
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
Have yourself a great week.

689
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,600
Another pod show podcast.

690
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,600
Stick it in your ear.

691
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
Thank you.
