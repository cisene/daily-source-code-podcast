00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
In July, Pacho asked you to declare your media independence for the unleash of Pacho Plus Beta.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,200
Now, we're insisting, system, in just days. The number one new media network in the world will get even better.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:23,600
All new features, advanced functionality. And now, we're proud to deliver the following show on the network that guarantees complete control of your media. Pacho.com.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,400
And an ex-generation distribution data with BET, under my belt, we don't need my freaking boots left.

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,200
I'd rather be flying my Cessna 182R beam into the future.

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,200
August 1st, Delta Sierra Charley, 491.

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,400
D.S.C. Academy.

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,000
D.S.C. 490.

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,400
Is the time tonight?

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,800
It's the way she walked behind us that back. It's the way she looked down.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I can't find what did establish it. You got chopping up the mail.

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,000
D.S.C.D.S.C. 390.

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,000
I know the love is going to never get it down.

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,000
A bad idea.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,200
Lurses so sweet when you can't be as small.

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,800
Looking so sweet when you can't be as small.

17
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,600
Lurses so sweet.

18
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,800
Winter, fish and tap it.

19
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,600
Loaning round four days.

20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,400
You got the best of everything.

21
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,400
You got the one in.

22
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,400
When you make what you can't get.

23
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,400
And before the best of this, we have to give this one more try.

24
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
I can't believe it.

25
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
I can't believe it.

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
I can't believe it.

27
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
I can't believe it.

28
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,400
I can't believe it.

29
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
I can't believe it.

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
I can't believe it.

31
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
I can't believe it.

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
I can't believe it.

33
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
I can't believe it.

34
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
I can't believe it.

35
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
I can't believe it.

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
I can't believe it.

37
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,400
I can't believe it.

38
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Lurses so sweet when you can't be as small.

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Looking so sweet when you can't be as small.

40
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Lurses so sweet when you can't be as small.

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:11,400
You got the best of everything You never want it

42
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Let you think what you can get And afford the best of this

43
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,400
We have to give this one more try

44
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,400
She's had a feeling for a long time now

45
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,400
She's had a feeling that she wanted more

46
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,400
She's had a feeling for a long time now

47
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,400
She's had a feeling that she hated or so

48
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,400
I want her way back

49
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,400
When you're with mine

50
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,400
I want her way away

51
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,400
When you're with mine

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,400
I want her way away

53
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
I want her way away

54
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,400
I want her way away

55
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,400
You got the best of everything You never want it

56
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:14,400
When you think what you can get And afford the best of this

57
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,400
We have to give this one more try

58
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Let it go

59
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Let it go

60
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Let it go

61
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400
Rory

62
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Tonight I don't care

63
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,400
I'm having a candy dinner from the pod save music network

64
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,400
I see they put that up

65
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,400
It's a couple months ago actually

66
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Of course the minute the song ends

67
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
The minute I start to talk that's when the phone starts to ring

68
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
No one else in the cottage

69
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
So we'll just have to bear with it in the background

70
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,400
I should actually hook that up to the mixer

71
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
So we can just answer these phone calls in the show

72
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Find out when people really want

73
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
Rory's from Florida

74
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
I discovered the song not by

75
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Proosing through the pod save music network

76
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,400
But actually I produced a BG blast number

77
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Rory's seven

78
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Well produced I hit record and like Christina do the rest

79
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
She's hosting episode number seven

80
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,400
And that was one of the songs they played

81
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
They're going to play on the show

82
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,400
So I love it when the young ones can just teach me a little bit

83
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
No I'm saying

84
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Okay

85
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Let me catch up on stuff that happened over the weekend

86
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Was extremely busy

87
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Because we have a big demo coming up

88
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Tuesday morning 7 a.m. in London

89
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,400
So I'm scooting out the door

90
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
As soon as I'm done with the show today

91
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
And I'll be staying in the city

92
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Which means, well you know what that means

93
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
And the show will be late tomorrow

94
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Not for you satellite listeners

95
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,400
But for those of you who kind of have gotten into

96
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Sync with me and are expecting the download to happen

97
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,400
So what was the big thing that we were preparing for Saturday night

98
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
I'm sorry Sunday night of course

99
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
Was Guy Fox night

100
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Bonfire night

101
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
I remember the fifth of the November

102
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Jump out of trees and them flat

103
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
I see no reason why I jumped out of trees

104
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
And should never be caught

105
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,400
And well

106
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Around three o'clock I called it

107
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
We they were expecting missed

108
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
With fog rolling in

109
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
And we were so busy

110
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
You know because we have our

111
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,400
BT podshow.com

112
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Unleash coming up this week

113
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,400
As well as podshow plus 2.0

114
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Maybe we should say 1.9

115
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Sounds better

116
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Podshow plus 1.9

117
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,400
And so we have Chris Rockwell

118
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
He was in London and he was going to go with me

119
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
And do the video photo

120
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Do the videoing

121
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
The videography

122
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
And I talked to Captain Dan who said

123
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
Well you know we can always do it

124
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
We can always go and wait

125
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
And if it sucks then then too bad

126
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
And then we won't do it

127
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
But what we don't want is to

128
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Go up flying and not be able to see the field

129
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
Because then you basically can't land anymore

130
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
And then you fucked

131
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
So

132
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Out of safety concerns

133
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
I call that probably

134
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
You know in hindsight

135
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
And of course it always is hindsight

136
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,400
Now I'm not at the airfield

137
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Then if boy if missed comes in to Farrow

138
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Echo golf tango fox trot

139
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
It really does come in

140
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
So where I am and what I was seeing

141
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,400
From my window and Gilford is not representative of the field

142
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,400
But it looks like we probably would have been okay

143
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,400
And it's too bad because the fireworks

144
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
From Stoke Park were just unbelievable

145
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,400
I could see them from my studio window

146
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
You know that's the guest bedroom

147
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
In the cottage

148
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
And it looked fantastic

149
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
So it was a bummer

150
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
But you know it was a full moon

151
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,400
And you could barely make out the full moon

152
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,400
So I'm not quite sure if that was cloud cover up above

153
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,400
Or if it was indeed already the missed rolling

154
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
And it's hard to say until you

155
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
I'm actually at the field

156
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,400
And someone else is landed

157
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,400
And said well here's what I saw upstairs

158
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,400
So sorry about that guys

159
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,400
But it's afty first

160
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
I hope you'll agree with me on that

161
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
Hi Adam

162
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
It's Mike here from the fishball acoustic podcast

163
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,400
At fishballacoustic.podshow.com

164
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Yes, we're positive family now

165
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Speed cameras

166
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
Bastards that they are

167
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,400
I just wanted to explain to you how they work over here

168
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,400
As someone who's had to pay a few of these things

169
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
In the past

170
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Basically the reason they want your license

171
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,400
is because they want to put penalty points on it

172
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,400
Yes, they give you an endorsement

173
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,400
With three to six penalty points

174
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Probably three if you just over the speed limit

175
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Now as you build up your points

176
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,400
If you get done for speeding a couple of times

177
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Or three or four times

178
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
Once you get to 12 points

179
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
Then you lose your license

180
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Now I'm not quite sure how that would work with a Dutch license

181
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,400
My wife is Dutch but she has a British license

182
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,400
So I don't know whether they can actually put endorsements

183
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,400
And penalty points on a Dutch license here in the UK

184
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,400
But I guess you'll find out

185
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Anyway, just thought that might be useful to you

186
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Tailwinds all the way mate

187
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
But not when you're driving

188
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
And folder

189
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Yeah, I appreciate that

190
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
And there's more that came in regarding that

191
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,400
So here you know this is the two speeding tickets

192
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Patricia got snapped on the camera

193
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
I'm doing 40 in a 30 zone

194
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
And of course I said I don't worry about

195
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
I'll just say it was me

196
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
I'm starting to regret that now

197
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
But this point thing

198
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
I have a Dutch license

199
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
I'm sure here's what's going to happen

200
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
They're going to say

201
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
You need a British license

202
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
And we're going to take the points

203
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
They're probably going to give me the license

204
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,400
Take the points off and take the license

205
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Right away immediately

206
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
So I'll be completely about driving credentials

207
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
Hi Adam, it's something clerk

208
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
After Odin asked us

209
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Welcome to the busy time

210
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
It's been speeding, fine procedure

211
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,400
It's fun, isn't it?

212
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,400
First of all, you get to let it tell me

213
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
But your car was stopped speeding

214
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
And asking me if you're the owner

215
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
So you've been in the form and send it back

216
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
And they didn't send you a letter saying

217
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
We have evidence that you were speeding

218
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Yes, of course they do

219
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
You bloody well gave it to them

220
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
And then comes the fine bitch

221
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
If you don't want to go to court and fight it

222
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
It was a bit irrelevant because it's not just a fine

223
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,400
It's three points on the license as well

224
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
And the way the system works here

225
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Get 12 points, they take your license away

226
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
But that's why they want the license in the post

227
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
They've got a stamp in

228
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Literally points

229
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
And after four years

230
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
The points are considered white

231
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,400
You can send the license off with another check

232
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
And nothing, you're back a license

233
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
No point showing it, you're going to clean license again

234
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Ask the way the system works

235
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Isn't it fun?

236
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Yes, thanks

237
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
It's a scam

238
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
It's a fucking scam is what it is

239
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,400
And in the Netherlands, I have to say

240
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
And a lot of people complained about

241
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
About the traffic

242
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Speed, what would you call it?

243
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Speed insurance system in the Netherlands

244
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Which is fantastic

245
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
I really, really like it

246
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Now of course it's very big brother

247
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
It's completely messed up

248
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
Here's what they do in the Netherlands

249
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,400
They have several different strips

250
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,400
You know, pieces of roadway

251
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,400
And what they'll do is they'll clock you

252
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,400
At the beginning of this length of roadway

253
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
And it could be several kilometers

254
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,400
And they know that you cannot reach the other end of the roadway

255
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
Any faster than X amount of time

256
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Any slower of course is okay

257
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
But any faster they say, well, you're speeding

258
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Because there's no way you can go that distance

259
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
Without going over the speed limit

260
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,400
And then they send you, they don't do any of this

261
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Do you own the car?

262
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
They just send you

263
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,400
A bill, basically

264
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,400
And what's nice?

265
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,400
And so there's no points off the license

266
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,400
This is something I do in the states as well

267
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Which, honestly, I think works quite well

268
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Because it is a deterrent

269
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Because it sounds like if you got four

270
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Four speeding tickets

271
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,400
That would be four times three is 12 points in your license

272
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
It's gone

273
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,400
So that definitely is a deterrent

274
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
And of course your insurance rates will go up

275
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
The states does that in many states at the same way

276
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
I remember New Jersey was that way, although

277
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Yeah, your points got deducted much sooner than four years

278
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
And you didn't have to pay for it and it was automatic

279
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
But what's in the Netherlands

280
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,400
I really like it because it's basically just

281
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
You know, it doesn't stop people from speeding at all

282
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,400
It's just like, well, you know, you take your chances

283
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
And if you got to get somewhere fast

284
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
You know how much it's going to cost

285
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
That's it

286
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,400
It's like buying a first-class ticket

287
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,400
So for people like the speed it's fantastic

288
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
Again, as a deterrent for speeding

289
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Then not at all, it doesn't work whatsoever

290
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Oh, parky sent in something about Guy Fox

291
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Stay home and say

292
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
I had him as parky just calling in

293
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,400
The bit more on this flying on Guy Fox night

294
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,400
I came back from Amsterdam on schedule flight

295
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Into London Heathrow

296
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
On Thursday evening

297
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,400
And then the fireworks even then

298
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
We're just amazing as we flew in

299
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,400
It was quite late and we're coming in low and low

300
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
And kind of on so sure

301
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
There's a lot of fireworks going off

302
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
And it just looked awesome

303
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
So if you can get up over the weekend

304
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,400
I think it'll be just going to be absolutely awesome

305
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,400
But my Saturday will be the best day

306
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,400
But there will be stuff going up on Sunday

307
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,400
All the organised displays will probably be on Saturday

308
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,400
But there's still plenty of private parties going on on Sunday

309
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,400
So you should get a decent view of what's going on

310
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
Take him and cheers back

311
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,400
So as I said earlier, I did get it up over the weekend

312
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Just not flying

313
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Apologies once again to Lady Patricia not on the show

314
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,400
She's at the cardiologist today for her

315
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,400
What is it to her quarterly check up

316
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,400
So they put on the treadmill

317
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,400
And make her generate electricity for guilt

318
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,400
And I said, I'm really going to miss you

319
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,400
I haven't been in the show for a long time

320
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
She says, well that's what it is

321
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,400
The families don't like it when moms are working

322
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
It's only fun for the moms

323
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Because she's not just doing it

324
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Doing this quarterly check up stuff

325
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,400
She's working on the house

326
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Which looks like a second week of January

327
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
Is moved day

328
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
So, bye-bye

329
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,400
Very, very busy

330
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,400
A poor city PD is a new show that we're debuting

331
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,400
Today, in fact if you go to podshow.com

332
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,400
You'll see it a trailer on the homepage

333
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
This thing is fucking amazing

334
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,400
20 minute episodes

335
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
It's a cop show

336
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,400
But made by independent producers

337
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
It just made completely independently

338
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
Actors, producers, writers, everything

339
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,400
And it just blows me away

340
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
The videographer of the cinematography

341
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,400
I should say the script

342
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
The sound effects

343
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
Good sound effects

344
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,400
Because when you fire a gun

345
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
It never sounds like it does on TV

346
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,400
And I'm really happy to have these guys on the network

347
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
I think you'll like it a lot

348
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Or at citypd.podshow.com

349
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
And Google has done it again

350
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,400
They have enticed me to go and buy some new hardware

351
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,400
I told you that they had this new Gmail application out

352
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,400
For Java phones

353
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Which I've been looking at the Nokia E61

354
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
For quite a while

355
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Chris Jacob

356
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,400
Our head guru sales weasel

357
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
Has won

358
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
And I've been kind of looking at it a little bit jealous

359
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Because it basically has everything in that N91

360
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
And it likes so much like Wi-Fi

361
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,400
And the ability to store tons of podcasts

362
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,400
And the only thing I didn't like about the N91

363
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,400
Besides the fact that it's like a brick

364
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,400
Is the keyboard is little

365
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Itty

366
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
Just teeny little slivers of keys

367
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
And it's only a numeric keypad

368
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
So if you want to hit the F

369
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
You have to go D-E-F

370
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,400
If to click three times

371
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,400
And so the E61

372
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
Kind of looks a bit like a blackberry

373
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
It's about the same size

374
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
And I finally bit the bullet

375
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,400
And went out and got one

376
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Specifically because I wanted to try out the Gmail application

377
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,400
Instead of using mobile Gmail on my blackberry

378
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
Which works fine as well

379
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,400
Let me tell you this thing kicks fucking ass

380
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,400
It is so incredibly cool

381
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Besides that this Gmail application

382
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
Is just the cat's meow

383
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
I mean really

384
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
I mean everything

385
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
I think yeah everything you can do

386
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
In a web browser you can do in this application

387
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
You have shortcut keys

388
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,400
That you can use

389
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,400
You can access all your different

390
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Well for icon folders

391
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,400
But I guess your labels or whatever they call it

392
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Really incredible

393
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,400
And of course the phone has built in Excel

394
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,400
And word and even power point

395
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
As tons of applications

396
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
This one came with a GPS application

397
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Remember I still have a Bluetooth GPS receiver

398
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Fucking works

399
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
It's like it's as good as a Tom Tom Go

400
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400
It's unbelievable

401
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
I'm really blown away

402
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
And just want you to know

403
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
The Google Responsible

404
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,400
For me shelling out like like like 600 bucks or something for this thing

405
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
But it's amazing

406
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Already I'm completely transitioned

407
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
I was able to synchronize my address book

408
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,400
So all my contacts are in there

409
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,400
It's cool

410
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
It's great

411
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
Get out of it

412
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
There's a lot to call it

413
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
Subministraria

414
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,400
I'm talking about the little Java Gmail client

415
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,400
For the mobile fund

416
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
You mentioned it in the episode

417
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
For nausea

418
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
I think it was on the product

419
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,400
I'm just putting it over

420
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
That's as with your experience

421
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
In the case

422
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
The little app does work here

423
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
With the mobile fund

424
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
In Australia

425
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,400
I'm using it on my

426
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,400
3060

427
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,400
And it works from the absolute treat

428
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
As you mentioned

429
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
It's at right the left

430
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
So

431
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Yeah

432
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Just thought I could get up into feedback

433
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,400
This is just from the personal productivity shows

434
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
On the podcast it works

435
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
Cheers

436
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
Cheers

437
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
It's ready to go

438
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
There's only one spot

439
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
You can do that

440
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
It's pod show

441
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
The game is shut down

442
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Other companies lay down

443
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Who change the rules

444
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,400
And things to stay sane now

445
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
We're pod show

446
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
To it

447
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
Others want to copy us

448
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
These catches like old hamburgers

449
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
They need to catch up

450
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
Wack shows

451
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Wack shows

452
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Wack shows with no spine

453
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
They needy

454
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
They're drowning in the sea

455
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
And thirst for originality

456
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Pod show

457
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
Poca tsunami

458
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
A nerve quake

459
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,400
The wave at the futile

460
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
And y'all are just in our wake

461
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
Pod show

462
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
That's where it ended

463
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Oh, those guys are happy about the new pod show

464
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Unleash

465
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
This is going to be great

466
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
It's going to be a wacky week

467
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,400
It really is

468
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,400
As we unleash BT Pod show dot com

469
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,400
I think that will be around Thursday

470
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
But you'll probably see some stuff happen

471
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
In fact

472
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
In fact

473
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Tuesday

474
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Around

475
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
I think it's 130

476
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
PM

477
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,400
Pacific time

478
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,400
So that will be 930

479
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
PM UK time

480
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,400
We have to bring the entire site down

481
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,400
All of Pod show dot com

482
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Has to come down

483
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
For several hours

484
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Now we contemplated doing this

485
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
In the middle of the night

486
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Of course

487
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
This is you know

488
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
It's so traditional

489
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
It's like you do an upgrade

490
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
It's like everyone gets up

491
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
A three in the morning

492
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
And does that shit

493
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
And then you have to give a very tight window

494
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
And we know it's going to take several hours

495
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
Because it's all kinds of database

496
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
Which shows we got a lot of people on the system

497
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
So we have to do this with extreme care

498
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
So not only are we launching

499
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,400
Launching BT Pod show dot com

500
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
But also

501
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
Unleashing Pod show

502
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Plus 1.9

503
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
As I explained earlier

504
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,400
1.9

505
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,400
Which

506
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,400
I think you're going to love this

507
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,400
We've really taken all of your feedback

508
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
To heart

509
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
And have created something amazing

510
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,400
And really opened up a whole new avenue for videos

511
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,400
And not just video podcasting

512
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,400
But also if you just want to upload your one video

513
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
Very analogous to YouTube

514
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
I would say

515
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
But then you can you can with one click

516
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
You can then add that into a show

517
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
Also your collections will change

518
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,400
You can instead of adding just shows to a collection

519
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
You can actually create your own RSS feed

520
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
Right within the system

521
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Your own feed of just stuff

522
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,400
So whatever it is it could be a picture

523
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
It could be a series of pictures

524
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
It could be a

525
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
One particular episode of a podcast

526
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
It could be a video

527
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Or a couple of videos that you like

528
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,400
And someone can subscribe to that

529
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
And we'll also bring you the ability

530
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
To create private feeds

531
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
So instead of email

532
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
You know

533
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,400
I'd detest when people

534
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
Send email

535
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,400
With their media

536
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
It's like hey you got to listen to this song

537
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
Check out this video

538
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
It's like I want a different way of receiving that

539
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,400
Also something that definitely assures me quality

540
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,400
So if you send me a feed

541
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
And that'll probably work the first time you send someone

542
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
An element

543
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400
You know say hey

544
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,400
Let me just set up a feed with you

545
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
You'll say yeah okay

546
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
I'll take your feed

547
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,400
It'll show up in your collection

548
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
So let's say it was from Michelle

549
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
From whispered pearls

550
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Because I'd love to get some feed from her

551
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,400
She would

552
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,400
Then add anything into that feed

553
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
That she wanted me to have

554
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
And that would show up automatically

555
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
And pod show applause

556
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
And of course if I subscribe to it

557
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
With my Nokia E61

558
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,400
Or the iPod it would show up there as well

559
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
And also of course on television

560
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
Now that we're getting close to

561
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Some of these IPTV projects

562
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Which is that's a story for a whole

563
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
A whole different episode

564
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Right

565
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,400
Hey don't forget a voice mail number

566
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
One, two, one

567
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Six, two, five

568
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Six, three, five

569
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
Seven

570
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
One, two, one

571
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
Six, two, five

572
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Six, three, five

573
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Seven

574
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Oh it's so well known

575
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
This phone number

576
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
Of course

577
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
On mobile phones worldwide

578
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Which you're supposed to plug it in

579
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
That's why we have plus one

580
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
But the plus in and then two

581
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
One and then two

582
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,400
One, sixty, five, six, three, five, seven

583
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
Because then whenever you're driving somewhere

584
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,400
You just give us a holler

585
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
Even if you're driving through the hills

586
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Of Florence Italy

587
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Tell Adam

588
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Checking him from the hills of Florence

589
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,400
Literally

590
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,400
This is almost so understandable

591
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
That's my sister Willow

592
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,400
Calling in from the hills of Northern Italy

593
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,400
Oh

594
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Cool

595
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
That's that service that I've turned Patricia on to

596
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Jaja

597
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
And I guess she's download

598
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,400
They have a mobile application

599
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Which she's I guess she's put on her phone

600
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,400
And calling from Italy sucks

601
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,400
It really blows

602
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
It's very expensive

603
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
And so Jaja is a great

604
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,400
A great solution to lowering cost

605
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,400
Not getting paid for this by the way

606
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
I just love the service

607
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
And we had another

608
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
$800 phone bill

609
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
From previous month

610
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Patricia just calling once or twice

611
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
You know a day

612
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,400
It's a lot of money

613
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,400
I can use that for something else

614
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
Now she's using Jaja and she loves it

615
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
She totally loves it and Willow's using it now as well

616
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
And they have an application which I tried to download

617
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
On to the E61 but for some reason couldn't get it to work

618
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,400
But I guess she's calling with it now

619
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
Of course she's on a mobile phone

620
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
The driving through Italy that's why it sounds so crappy

621
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
It sounds so crappy

622
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
It's really cool

623
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,400
It's another show set of supporting that one out

624
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,400
And I hope you've been on fire

625
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
Saying remember to remember

626
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
This weekend

627
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
I'm looking forward to meeting

628
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,400
Back to that

629
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
And I'm sorry about the student ticket

630
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,400
And they're with the hospital

631
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
But I think I don't have a bit more pressure

632
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,400
So they're actually going to grow

633
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,400
I think that's what happened in the back

634
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,400
So I'm going to see what happened to that

635
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
I'm doing it in 65 euros

636
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
And

637
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,400
And let me call it

638
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,400
More stuff

639
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,400
I'm going to tell you about

640
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
I have a nice week

641
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
And that's it

642
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
Bye

643
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
I will

644
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,400
I wish I could understand

645
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,400
More than 40% of what you send in

646
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,400
But I think that's just the cell phone

647
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
And maybe you have the window open or something

648
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
Oh well

649
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,400
But still that voice number sure does work

650
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
Doesn't it?

651
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
And I fucked up a couple times

652
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
On food philosophy

653
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,400
Jennifer's really angry at me

654
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Hey Adam

655
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
It's Jennifer from Food Philosophy

656
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
So there it was

657
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,400
Climbing the muddy treacherous hillsides of Italy

658
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,400
Striving to get perfect footage from my podcast

659
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
A great personal risk

660
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
And I finished the day feeling great

661
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,400
Satisfied with my success

662
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
And then I returned to here

663
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
This

664
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Serious broadcast

665
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Coming up next is two for Tuesday

666
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
Jennifer and Aloe tells us why food

667
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
And sensuality are the perfect pairing

668
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Seems you're pretty good at

669
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
British pronunciations like

670
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
Controversy or

671
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
Actually

672
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,400
But your Italian sucks

673
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Oh

674
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,400
That hurt

675
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
So let's try that again

676
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
Shall we because you're making my ancestor spin

677
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
In their graves

678
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
So repeat after me

679
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
Yanolo

680
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
Yanolo

681
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
See?

682
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
It's easier

683
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
Yanolo

684
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,400
I think you can manage

685
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Yanolo

686
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
Of course

687
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,400
At least you remember the name of my show

688
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
For that broadcast

689
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
Which you seem to have forgotten

690
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
A few days later

691
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,400
In fact our insertion technology

692
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,400
We really use for golden tickets

693
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,400
Which we'll be coming out with

694
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,400
Actually there was one on

695
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
Ah, what's the Jennifer show

696
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
You're going to give the fork

697
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Yanolo, is that it?

698
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,400
No, it's going to kill me

699
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,400
Slap me, slap me with a wet towel

700
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Adam, sweetie

701
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
We just can't have these malfunctions

702
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
Okay

703
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,400
I thought that having the first golden ticket promotion

704
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Since yours

705
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,400
On food philosophy

706
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Actually had some meaning

707
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
So I think you need to make that up to me

708
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
Oh

709
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,400
And you know I want to throw a little challenge your way

710
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
I know it's going to be scary to you

711
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,400
But hopefully you'll face it with some dignity

712
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
Okay

713
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
Because you have three handy little flavors

714
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
Of splendour over there

715
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,400
But I have eight flavors

716
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,400
Of filtrous gourmet selections coffee

717
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
So I am challenging you, my friend

718
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
To a cook-off

719
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
Let's see who can come up with the better recipe

720
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
Now for you I have a feeling

721
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
That your listeners might need to help you out

722
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Because well

723
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
You can't even boil pasta

724
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,400
But you know that's your problem

725
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,400
So

726
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
I can boil pasta

727
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
I just didn't have the right tools

728
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
And it slipped out of the thing

729
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,400
And down the drain

730
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Hey

731
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
You're stuck in the kitchen

732
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
Burning and mangling ingredients

733
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
They can come over and visit me

734
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,400
And have a chance to win a golden ticket

735
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
At foodphilosophy.podshow.com

736
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,400
And see what we're cooking up over there

737
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
So bring it on

738
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
Big hard boy

739
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,400
I've got a wet towel right here

740
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
And it's got your name

741
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,400
All over it

742
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
Oh and I'm a folder

743
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,400
I know

744
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
I know you wouldn't talk like that

745
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,400

00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
Oh

767
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,400
Oh

768
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Oh

769
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
Oh

770
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,400
Oh

771
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,400
Oh

772
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Oh

773
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Oh

774
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Oh

775
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Oh

776
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
Oh

777
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,400
Oh

778
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
Oh

779
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:58,400
Oh

780
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Oh

781
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
Oh

782
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
Oh

783
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Oh

784
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Yes

785
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:04,900
Oh

786
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,140
I just think you know it's

787
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,900
Oh, oh, oh

788
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,420
Yeah, you feelin' the need to know it's

789
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,100
Oh, oh, oh, oh

790
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,780
Do I know I feelin' the need to know it's

791
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:28,980
Yeah, you feelin' the need to know it's

792
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:53,540
Yeah, you feelin' the needs to know it's

793
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:58,240
Now we're all for now

794
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,540
Now you're here and you're here

795
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:05,540
So now we're all for now

796
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,540
You're all for now

797
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,540
You're all for now

798
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:15,540
You're all for now

799
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:22,540
You're all for now

800
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,540
You're all for now

801
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:29,540
You're all for now

802
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,540
Why rapes?

803
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,540
The pod save music network

804
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,540
A lot of people playing hey Kate

805
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,540
It's getting major pod play

806
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,540
But this is another one of those that I discovered

807
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,540
Viad and BG blast

808
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,540
It's over

809
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,540
From South Carolina's favorite sons

810
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,540
I realized I gave it a whole wind up about

811
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,540
Taking everything down

812
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,540
Tuesday

813
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,540
I didn't tell you exactly what we're going to do instead of it

814
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,540
So I will right after this

815
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,540
Is your computer a hacker magnet?

816
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,540
It won't be anymore because Earth Link is here to save the day

817
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:07,540
With Donald's faster than speeding boat

818
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,540
And far all it is more powerful than a locomotive

819
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:17,540
It has an anti-virus system that cleanses your PC with the click of a mouse

820
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,540
It's a blur

821
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,540
It's a plane

822
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,540
It's Earth Link

823
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,540
Perfect internet from outer space

824
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:28,540
It linked to Earth with powers and abilities far greater than those of normal high speed

825
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,540
And price is so low that it will blow you out of this world

826
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:35,540
So make the right decision and turn to Earth Link as your internet provider

827
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:39,540
The last time somebody drove

828
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,540
Right so here's the piece that I forgot which is pretty damn important

829
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,540
So instead of sneaking off in the middle of the night

830
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,540
And everyone being tired and rushing and trying to get stuff done before people wake up

831
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,540
And of course that doesn't work anymore since we're globally

832
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:59,540
You know people in Australia rely on us people in Europe rely on us people in the United States rely on us

833
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:04,540
It's like you can never be a hide that from anyone at any given moment

834
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,540
It's happy our somewhere right

835
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:11,540
So what we're going to do instead is we're going to do a dry run of something called the plus

836
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:15,540
Now the plus is a 24 hour 7 day week video station

837
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,540
That we've been working on covertly for

838
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:23,540
Not from here right like I haven't talked about it here covertly for a number of weeks

839
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:28,540
And it's going to be interesting we'll have all the coolest videos

840
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:31,540
Not just music videos but all kinds of videos

841
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,540
Video shows you know all scheduled

842
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,540
We're actually we're going to start off with one feed

843
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:41,540
But we will have a feed for Europe a feed for the east coast a feed for the west coast

844
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:47,540
And we'll have you know live breaks coming to you from Pacho HQ in San Francisco Los Angeles

845
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,540
New York and London

846
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:55,540
But for Monday as I said 130 pm eastern Pacific time is when we start

847
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:03,540
We're going to do a dry run of the plus and I believe the lovely intel is the Amy Mc'll be hosting for us

848
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:09,540
So you'll actually see the engineers sweating away as they're working on getting stuff up and we'll bring you updates

849
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,540
You know we've always done fun videos and stuff during downtime

850
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:17,540
So that's what so nothing will be accessible except for one page with that

851
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:21,540
And obviously we're going to work as quick as we can to keep everyone's podcast rolling

852
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,540
Nothing else should break

853
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:28,540
Even iTunes should resume perfectly after we come back up in a perfect world of course

854
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,540
So look forward to that on Tuesday

855
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:36,540
And that'll be just before the unleash of Pacho plus one dot nine and BTpacho dot com

856
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,540
It's a lot I know

857
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:44,540
Before I get out of here remember if you want a great deal of domain name use check out code dsc3 at godaddy.com

858
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:51,540
And right I'm off to get this show up on the system and I will be back with you

859
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:57,540
Well, if not tomorrow because we may I may just not do a show because of well, you know

860
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:01,540
Because of our our our switch over

861
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,540
If not tomorrow then it'll be Wednesday

00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,540
