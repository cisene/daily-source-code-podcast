3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,560
First thing that Brisco did that impressed us was, we're not only to come in and really read the dialogue well as an actor,

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,720
but he also did a standing flip in our office.

5

Hey, this is PD Love, and you're listening to the Daily Source Code 478 for Fubar Friday, the 13th.

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,400
Kind of scary.

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,760
This episode may contain some mature and well-reather strange material, something like this.

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,120
Pump that, that side, that bad boy up and down, you pump it, you pump it, you pump it, you pump it, and then all of a sudden it becomes frothy.

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,280
Pour a little bit in, then the coffee, and then the rest, and it's good.

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:06,760
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation radio content in my ears.

14
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,280
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,240
I'm just kidding, it's a matter of curry.

16
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,600
You pump it, you pump it, and then all of a sudden it becomes frothy.

17
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,600
Pour a little bit in, then the coffee, and then the rest, then it's good.

18
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:50,200
Someone slipped a note right in my pocket, said what's going on with you.

19
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,840
Nothing out the ordinary, I say, except I'm feeling kind of new.

20
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:05,480
Someone picked my heart up off the floor, so why should I keep quiet anymore?

21
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,920
Because I've been tied to a treat for as long as I'm out.

22
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:18,680
When you said it free, now I'm ready to go, and I won't be alone anymore.

23
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:27,000
I finally got a place, got my food in the door, my food in your door, oh.

24
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,000
Someone said you crazy, your delusion, oh.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,160
I can do all that, it's to the cool American likes, simple minded thoughts under your head.

26
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:55,000
But there's not a single country of the world that could say it any better.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,080
I'm a beautiful girl, has that been tied to a treat for as long as I'm out.

28
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:08,840
When you said me free, now I'm ready to go, and I won't be alone anymore.

29
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:17,240
I finally got a place, got my food in the door, my food in your door, oh.

30
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:26,360
And it's so good to be back home, don't know why I never go.

31
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:33,320
I don't feel like I can do time.

32
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:05,640
So tell me what you've got under control.

33
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,320
It's so hard to have a feeling that I'm not let alone, no.

34
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:18,760
So please indulge me for a little longer, don't worry, we're almost to the end of the song.

35
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,600
Because I've been tied to a treat for as long as I'm out.

36
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,800
When you said me free, now I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go,

37
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,920
it's so long to be holding a fool, I know it's good enough if it wasn't for me.

38
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:46,360
And I won't be alone anymore, I'm finally got a place, got my food in the door,

39
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,120
my food in the door, oh.

40
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,600
We're got our food in the door, we're gonna ask you.

41
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,880
The Jeff Smith, the one and only official imaging consultant of the daily source code,

42
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,680
brand new song from Jeff, I got my foot in the door, and did he see I got my footing your

43
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,200
door at some point? Sound like a really bad German porn movie.

44
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,840
Hey everybody, how you doing coming to you from a cloudy northern California today?

45
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,120
It is the daily source code, my head is, as you can tell, completely clogged up,

46
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,600
but I'm feeling a little bit better, I'd actually last night, I had some work to do, so I couldn't

47
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,520
get into bed until, was about quarter to eleven, which is a little bit late for me, because

48
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,880
you don't like to get up at five thirty to get the show cranking for you, get it out before the

49
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:38,120
satellite window closes. And I'd actually reset my alarm to six thirty, I said to myself,

50
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,560
I'm not deserve an extra hour, it's fucking Friday, I need it. I welcome at five fifteen,

51
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,520
you know, no difference, it's like, every since I did that year-long morning show three

52
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,040
years ago, I just can't sleep longer, it just doesn't work anymore. It is Friday the 13th,

53
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:00,040
of course, traditionally, that's a day of bad luck. I've never had, can I knock on some wood here?

54
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,960
There we go, knock on some wood. I've never had any bad luck on Friday the 13th,

55
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:12,040
and I hope you have a very lucky Friday the 13th, and let's see, it's I'm looking forward to the

56
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,000
weekend, because I really, really, really got to regain some strength, traveling to New York,

57
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:26,280
Sunday, and then we have meetings Monday, and Tuesday, I am on a panel at, it's an agency in New York,

58
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,720
called OMD. Now, no, no, not related to orchestral maneuvers in the dark, but they're doing a

59
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,120
huge, I think you call it a symposium, really, so it's for advertisers, advertising agencies,

60
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:45,560
buying media buying companies, and I think I'm on a panel with one of the YouTube guys,

61
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,480
so that should be very interesting, and actually I should see if I could get that recorded,

62
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:55,720
if I can share that with you, and then Tuesday night, back to San Fran, because we got stuff to do

63
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:02,920
here, and well, in a week from now, then I'll be going home. I must say, it's always that

64
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,280
first weekend when you think, it's time for the weekend, what am I going to do with the girls

65
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:13,720

66
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,640

67
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,680
right, my in-laws are great, but they do get a little, um, they're a little busy.

68
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,600
If you got in laws, you know what I mean, but it's great so she can spend a lot of time with them,

69
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,880
focus all of her attention on them, oh, man, they're over it. They're like 81, 82 now,

70
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,280

131

Newcast set off hey Adam this is Matt and mom speaking Michigan hey on uh DSC 477 you had mentioned

132
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,760
something about North Korean explosion you know I just heard an article today on uh I think was this

133
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,560
we can science podcast and they had said uh kind of like the whole skeptical thing was a while back

134
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,880
I guess it was a massive explosion in North Korea something to do with a mine or they were building a mine

135
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,880
and it set off all the seismic you know meters saying that there was something going on people thought oh my gosh

136
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,520
this is a nuclear you know a test and quickly North Korea said no this was an explosion bubble of

137
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,560
well that kind of puts into the whole mindset that you know hey if this guy really is crazy like a fox

138
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,120
basically this guy's a big you know mad genius why not be doing the same thing so you know while the last

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,800
nice I like it despite the fact that you're a scruncher well you know I've listened to your show

145
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,280
I've seen some of the video stuff you guys have done uh all you're missing all you're missing is a hot

146
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,200
babe on the show you know like uh like tool time then it would be fucking perfect I like your uh

147
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,840
your theory there um what was the strength on the Richter scale of that previous explosion which

148
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,880
they said was just a mine explosion was it also coincidentally around a four on the Richter scale

149
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,760
no one has really been able to come back to me yet with you know I mean what's the point of a

150
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,960
nuke you know um I guess you can make a small nuke right that only sets off a little explosion

151
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,840
towards really just their word against everyone else's hmm anyway interesting theory I like that

152
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,880
um let's see there was one other thing we talked about yes they which of course covered most of the

153
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,640
news but um I'm glad that most of you like to my take on uh on looking at the story

154
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:09,840
yeah at a long time yes you were sir immediately yes I'm sure you've heard about the

155
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:16,160
crash and then hadn't yesterday uh pitch for New York Yankees colloidal uh when there's some trouble

156
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,920
I guess wait a minute wait that's the wrong one I'm sorry uh I'm so sorry

157
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,640
this is what I meant to play for you hey Adam this is Tom Rockle from the Buckeye Drive's time

158
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:34,160
podcast and just wanted to say thanks for taking the time to kind of go through an explanation about

159
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,360
the playing crash in New York yesterday every other news outlet not the news junkies I listen

160
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,080
and read just about everything I could find on yesterday we're all kind of working some kind of

161
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:50,000
an angle about either blame you know who's fault was it and or a political angle about how could

162
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,160
this happen again and there should be no air you know nothing in the air around New York which would

163
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,840
mean no light flights no helicopters you know that kind of stuff and uh you're the only person

164
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:08,560
slash aviator to get in there and give an educated guess on some possibilities and not play the

165
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:16,400
high games and just really appreciate it dude I was totally my pleasure I do want to revise

166
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,240
my analysis a little bit though because now there's more information that I receive yes and I have

167
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,520
to say again it's all been from CNN the best information that I've gotten on on this incident

168
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,360
which I do know a lot about about flying has been from CNN so they had more information from the

169
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,720
NTSB the National Transportation Safety Board I've got to trust those guys you know they put out

170
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,520
all the the accident reports which I read pretty regularly you know in particular for the type of

171
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,160
aircraft I've been flying in or for interesting situations because you know you're supposed to learn

172
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:53,840
from this stuff so the first of all the aircraft was not going north the south it was going south

173
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,040
north for all intents and purposes for the analysis of the wind blowing the aircraft towards Manhattan

174
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,560
right right into the city that doesn't make much difference what is very interesting is that

175
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:14,000
the aircraft was at about 500 feet and they actually had the radar flight path so they they tracked

176
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,600
the you know they can go back and they can look at the radar data and they can see exactly

177
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,280
and barely I bet because once you get below that you know four 300 feet radar really can't track

178
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,680
it's but I'm gonna say that I have to believe that this was indeed fact that NTSB was putting out

179
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:35,680
it looked like he was up about maybe a little bit above 500 feet and then turned left

180
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,320
and then descended very rapidly another 200 feet so down to about 300 feet and then crashed into

181
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:50,560
the building basically heading south so almost a 180 and there were more eyewitness reports from

182
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:56,400
the ground which really are fucking useless because I mean you know people will hear something

183
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,320
and then they'll look up and then they'll think they saw all the events before the actual crash

184
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,760
I mean it's all it's it's very unreliable data but they had a couple people now who were saying

185
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:12,240
well it looked like the plane did two barrel two or three barrel rolls one eyewitness actually said

186
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:19,440
the plane didn't crash head on but it crashed with its underside against against the building

187
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,200
and then in addition to that there was an NTSB spokeswoman who said it appeared that the engine

188
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:32,000
was actually still running when it crashed into the building so here's now we do know that there

189
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,720
was an emergency call so the engine may have been running but it may have been severely underpowered

190
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,160
my analysis is still going to be kind of the same except one major difference oh and the flight

191
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:51,040
instructor no details about his how many hours or his type ratings other than that he's been

192
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:56,560
flying since he was a teenager that doesn't mean too much but he was only 26 I have to say all my

193
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,360
instructors have been older than I am and I really like the old guys I really like the guys with the

194
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,000
experience because you know they just don't take no crap from nobody particularly not if you're

195
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,040
a celebrity or well known or you know and I can imagine that there may have been some of that going on

196
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,360
with this instructor and with the with the with the student with Corey Lidal in this case or

197
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,480
he was piloting command but I probably he was still kind of under instruction while they were flying

198
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:33,840
but what a horrible mistake to to try and attempt a turn at 500 feet if you have an engine failure

199
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,200
and you're that close to buildings that that is just it is really the automatic

200
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,640
response you know turn turn away from the wind so you have the wind at your back so you can get

201
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,480
maximum glide and then start looking for a place to land but when you're flying up that east corridor

202
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,440
there is no place to land so the there is only one decision and that is into the water

203
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:06,240
straight ahead down into the water you go and and the this probably wouldn't have happened if they

204
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,000
so I'm just I'm just guessing here obviously but from you know I started with helicopters

205
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,120
so my helicopter experience really taught me you know when you're in a helicopter you don't even

206
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,160
try you you try not even to fly over a patch of woods because you know in the event of an

207
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,000
emergency you've got to do an auto rotation which means you're going to be down the ground pretty

208
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,720
quick and you got one shot there's no long glides in helicopters it's one way down and and you

209
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,840
can land it safely but you've got to have the room to land you've got to have some space so in helicopters

210
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,840
we often fly around those types of situations if I was flying up the east river in a helicopter I

211
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,200
know for damn sure there's only one place I'm going down and I've made that decision before I

212
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,280
enter the corridor before so that you know exactly for this so you don't make and make this type of

213
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,280
mistakes so I believe automatically engine failure or there was some type of performance issue

214
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,480
turned with the wind in their back and started descending of course and I believe that the

215
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,600
barrel roll was probably because they were really trying to make the turn to avoid the building

216
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,520
and probably just rolled it over maybe and it's also possible that the that they reach a

217
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,560
stall situation so the the rotation of the engine would have certainly facilitated that left flip

218
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:30,080
and they were out of control at that point so it's very very sad it's so what we call an aviation

219
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:36,480
having a bad fucking day hello there I'm Christina Curry host of episode four of BG Blast

220
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,440
be sure and check us out this week as we spin tracks from tricky and the wild bunch here about

221
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,040
Pallon is a webbi nominate internet TV show and much much more only two weeks left of the

222
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:54,720
hallows cream promotion so you better hurry up see you on the show oh baby I miss you hi Adam this is Tanya

223
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:00,720
back from Ireland I just wanted to tell you with me lucky charms oh that I'm actually a listener

224
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,640
I'm not a podcaster to block the listeners like Stacey here beside me hello Adam I think about

225
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,800
BT Potcho it's just that it just doesn't sound like it's localized the whole thing it sounds like

226
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:19,680
it's made for the BT UK market so to my ears it means BT Potcho isn't inclusive because it's not

227
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,320
localized content you know what I mean basically people want to hear a Scottish accent on

228
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:30,880
tartan podcast and they want to hear an Irish accent on the Dublin culture slot spot cast exactly

229
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,160
people want to hear low could you say the Dublin culture slots well how's that hit what was that

230
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:41,360
yeah an Irish accent on the Dublin culture slot spot cast it sounds like you say culture slots

231
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:47,600
pod I love it I love that I love this concept exactly people want to hear local voices talking

232
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:54,800
about local things that means getting unique British content and authentic Irish content that's right

233
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:00,400
yeah another thing Adam BT's marketing muscle it's not as dominant in Ireland as in the UK

234
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:07,440
now we're not getting the same message from BT in Ireland as BT puts out in England oh hold on a second

235
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:14,640
hold on a second oh let's just back at him for a second okay we have a partnership with BT

236
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,640
and part of that partnership is to be able to use their marketing muscle anything they've got

237
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,360
anything and that marketing muscle is not the messages you're seeing we're going to be providing

238
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,560
the messages pod show you know it's it's it's it's our game here so we're going to be using

239
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:36,800
BT's media muscle because yeah one of the which one BT's one of the biggest advertisers

240
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:44,080
in the UK at all telco companies are so um that's what we're going to be using it for

241
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,320
and localized of course we think we'd have an American accents doing Irish shows or or Londoner's

242
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,800
talking about Manchester no way hey those of you on series stars 102 we've got another three and

243
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,680
half hours of great podcast coming up on the pod show on serious have a great weekend I'll see you on Monday

244
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,040
let's continue with the girls from Ireland think we do do we know we don't the reason for this

245
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,680
is the two markets they're distinct like this is in terms of the currency the local infrastructure

246
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,760
and the telecom regulations as well what currency do you guys use there actually in in Ireland

247
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,960
that's really stupid I don't know that you know I've never been to Ireland which is why I don't know

248
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:31,040
what's the currency of Ireland is it the blues now here in Ireland we hear about BT

249
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,160
show this is based on what you say on your podcast now you make a personal and that's the best

250
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:41,360
toy you talk about things for people that are interested in podcasting all right now I might be

251
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,800
making this bigger than it needs to be but you know we are different I am never against making

252
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:52,640
it bigger than it needs to be Ireland we play harling better than we play football we drink longer

253
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,600
than anybody else in Europe that's true and you can actually legally land your airplane on our

254
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:04,000
grass pastures even if they're not designation as an error drill it's green everywhere over here

255
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,440
and that means that we can grow our own wood pellets yeah I mean you find our own biodiesel fields

256
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:15,120
how about that you got to get your ass over here for patties today you really do you're going to

257
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:22,080
hook me up you'll say chill oh you'll say that's so nice girls okay first of all thank you so much

258
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:30,960
for the invitation to land my airplane on your grass strip whenever fantastic how about weed in

259
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,400
Ireland if it's so great up there I bet you guys got some killer herb let me know about that will

260
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,880
I'll check this out you're gonna love this this is this is awesome it's football we got to play

261
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:52,880
it's so crazy right yeah okay go

Will always be messed up

268
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:15,680
TV, they don't sell his cereal at the store

269
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,680
They don't show his cartoons are TV

00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,680
We're messed up

273
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,680
TV, they're thinking about you

274
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,680
And I'll tell you the truth

275
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,680
We will roll around you

276
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,680
All around you, when you're alive

277
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:54,680
The memories we've all of a man

278
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:59,680
Will always be messed up

279
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:07,680
TV, they don't sell his cereal at the store

280
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,680
Can't sell his cereal at the store

281
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:21,680
They don't sell his cereal at the store

282
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,680
The memories we've all of a man

283
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,680
Will always be messed up

284
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,680
TV

285
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,680
That's some high-fifth shit man

286
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,680
That's a mixed-master Mandy from Tennessee

287
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,680
I received a link and email to the

288
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,680
To the Potta music network

289
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,680
And it's been quite a while since I've actually listened to

290
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,680
Every single song that an artist had up on their page

291
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,680
This is really interesting

292
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,680
First of all, there can never be enough songs about Mr. TV

293
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,680
Let's be honest about that

294
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,680
But you've got to check out Mixmaster Mandy

295
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,680
This girl who, as a whole band

296
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,680
It's not just her

297
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,680
Bills herself as a female back in style and humor

298
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
And damn straight

299
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,680
And there's a whole different range of styles

300
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,680
And there is some very back-ish stuff

301
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,680
Some like Weasery stuff

302
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,680
Our vocals are really, really amazing

303
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,680
To go check that out

304
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,680
Of course, link to that in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com

305
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,680
Yesterday, or at least last night

306
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,680
To Pacific Standard Time

307
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,680
You might have, you know, I've told you about this

308
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,680
Accurate target cast that we have, right?

309
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,680
Which is essentially, it's an entertainment-based show

310
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,680
But it is without a doubt

311
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,680
An infomercial to inform you about the new Accurate RDX SUV

312
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,680
If you were, if you went to Accurate.podshow.com

313
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,680
You might have been greeted by

314
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,680
Reginald fart bottom

315
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,680
You know, whenever we have some maintenance upgrades

316
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,680
We'd like to actually highlight it

317
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,680
So we were running some of our wacky videos again

318
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,680
And there was a new one, claymation

319
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,680
Reginald fart bottom

320
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,680
But of course, it wasn't our intention to actually

321
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,680
Make that show up on all pages

322
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,680
Such as, you know, podshow.com

323
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,680
Yeah, but we wanted to have something different

324
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,680
On our partner channels

325
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,680
Such as Accurate.podshow.com

326
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,680
And I kind of missed that one up

327
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,680
So if you were wondering what the heck is that all about

328
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,680
That's what it was about

329
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,680
Everything restored back to normal now

330
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,680
But in the future, we'll do some customized stuff

331
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,680
For a free-to-art partner channels

332
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,680
Accurate.podshow.com

333
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,680
But while we're at it, check this out

334
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,680
Yo, Adam

335
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,680
Yo, trucker Tom here

336
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,680
Hey, I wanted to tell you my

337
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,680
Splendid story

338
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,680
I knew you would

339
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,680
For a long time now, I've been

340
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,680
Kind of lazy and

341
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,680
Been buying all these diet

342
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,680
Cokes diet Pepsi

343
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,680
And I decided that

344
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,680
You know, drinking that all the time

345
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,680
Just because it's convenient

346
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,680
Probably isn't really a good idea

347
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,680
For a long-term hydration

348
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,680
You know, the problem I've had in the past

349
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,680
I just couldn't bring myself to

350
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,680
By bottled water

351
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,680
You know, the idea of paying for water

352
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,680
Just really has bothered me

353
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,680
And so finally, I decided

354
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,680
That you know, I'm going to have to just

355
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,680
Break down and start buying water

356
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,680
Instead of diet soda

357
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,680
You know, bottled water by itself

358
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,680
You know, it just doesn't taste as good

359
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,680
As the diet soda does

360
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,680
So I'm cheating a little bit

361
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,680
What I've been doing

362
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,680
Is using Splenda

363
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,680
You just unscrew the cap on the

364
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,680
On the bottled water

365
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,680
And put about three packets of Splenda

366
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,680
Down and there

367
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,680
And put the cap back on and shake it up

368
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,680
And you've got a nice little drink

369
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,680
That, you know, it's better

370
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,680
Obviously than the

371
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,680
Carbonated soda

372
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,680
But

373
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,680
Yet, you know, and I'm drinking water

374
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,680
I'm drinking plenty of water as I'm driving each day

375
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,680
Thought you might be interested in that

376
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,680
There's a, there's a use for

377
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,680
Splenda

378
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,680
Besides, you know, flavoring your

379
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,680
Since a.o. or your coffee

380
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,680
Or whatever it is, you're flavoring

381
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,680
Try flavoring your water

382
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,680
Hey, you can find me at trucker.com

See you later, my friend

Take it easy

388
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,680
And watch those domain name

389
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,680
Oh, yeah

Frapper

391
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,680
Frapper

392
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,680
Oh, Tom

393
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,680
I still do not want to know what you're talking about

394
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,680
Oh, sorry

395
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,680
Here comes the echo

396
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,680
We've got to put that in today

397
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,680
This is what a great, great, amazing product

398
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,680
The Splenda stuff is

399
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,680
It's so easy to

400
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,680
To advertise for too

401
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,680
I don't do shit

402
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,680
You guys love this stuff

403
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,680
It's clear

404
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,680
It's so clear

405
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,680
I gotta figure out if soccer girl is in on this

406
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,680
Splenda promotion

407
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,680
Because I have a feeling that she and Ryan could do some really interesting

408
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,680
Test with that

409
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,680
Nemo to self kind of do that

410
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,680
It's Friday

411
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,680
What if you not heard yet on this daily source code?

412
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,680
Huh?

413
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,680
I'd like to make a motion

414
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,680
To rock this mother out

415
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,680
Just to come and throw

416
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,680
You're on her

417
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,680
Please don't bang that gavel

418
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,680
You can try this cowbell out

419
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,680
Let's all give a night

420
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,680
To the hardest work in lawyers

421
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,680
Drives inside

422
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,680
And hands

423
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,680
Drives inside

424
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,680
But yeah

425
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,680
What do you say?

426
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,680
Yo, what's up, Adam?

427
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,680
It's Jersey Todd, the official musical

428
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,680
Just of the Cha Cha

429
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,680
So dude, can you guess my favorite class in law school?

430
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,680
No, civil procedure?

431
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,680
No, boring

432
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,680
Property law?

433
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,680
Black acre versus white acre

434
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,680
I mean, who the hell cares?

435
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,680
Criminal law?

436
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
Forget about it

437
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,680
Those people are screwed

438
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,680
No, no, my favorite class

439
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,680
Was contract law

440
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,680
And I just wanted to thank you

441
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,680
And the gang from Pod Show

442
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,680
For sending out my very own copy

443
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,680
Of the Pod Show contract

444
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,680
Dude, that think kicks ass

445
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,680
The phrasing, the word play

446
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,680
I mean, I read that for like two hours

447
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,680
And it's a thing of friggin' legal beauty

448
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,680
Loved every part of it right down to the left

449
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,680
Cautisol

450
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,680
And let me say one thing to the podisphere

451
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,680
After reviewing the contract

452
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,680
I signed it without one change

453
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,680
That's right, Jersey Todd has signed with Pod Show

454
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,680
So crap, crap

455
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,680
That means I have to come up with some more good stuff

456
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,680
Of the DSC, right?

457
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,680
All right, let's think about this

458
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,680
I know

459
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,680
The Jersey Todd shall work out

460
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,680
Okay, ready kids?

461
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,680
Here we go

462
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,680
Take both your hands and put them up to next to your head

463
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,680
All right

464
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,680
With the palms facing out

465
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,680
Palms facing out

466
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,680
Now bend your ring finger in your middle finger

467
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,680
So they touch your palms

468
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,680
Got those devil horns up

469
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,680
Good, good

470
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,680
Feel the burn

471
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,680
Now let's take your head back

472
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,680
And shake it like you were saying

473
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,680
Yes, over and over

474
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,680
Let's repeat

475
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,680
One, two, three, keep going

476
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,680
Because from the pod safe music network

477
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,680

Oh, crap. That's a music right there, man. I tell you,

549
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,320
a pillow for confession box. Jersey Todd, thank you so much and welcome to the family, my friend.

550
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,560
What an endorsement that was. Thank you so much. Wow, my ears are like, oh shit.

551
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:17,440
I've lost all high end in my head now. Before I forget that, it's Friday.

552
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,280
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday,

553
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:28,000
Friday, and it's final fun. Yeah, that's right, everybody. It's end of the week and

554
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,120
actually I'm going to be on the Gilmore gang today, I believe. So that'll probably, I guess we

555
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:41,280
record it today and then it comes out on Sunday or something like that in eight million broken up

556
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:47,440
pieces. So I'll check that out at Gilmoregang.potcho.com. Final thought for the week. Well,

557
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,680
there's really only been two things that have been on my mind near the latter part of the week.

558
00:40:51,680 --> 00:41:01,200
And that's of course Corey Lidal and North Korea. You know, you really just have to look at these

559
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,640
incidents and I think yourself, you know, who's better or worse off? You know, the Corey Lidal have a great

560
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,160
life until it ended so abruptly. Yeah, I think he did. Who's doing what he loved? You know,

561
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:19,680
and is he in any, was he in any more or less danger before he crashed, you know, than we are North

562
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:28,160
Korea and shit heat up and all this talk of global thermal nuclear war, it really only brings me

563
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:34,080
back to my life philosophy and the final thought for this week is whatever you do in this life.

564
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,040
Please ride the wheels off this motherfucker.

565
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:52,240
All right, everybody. That's it. I got a good idea here. I got to get dressed. Yeah, that's right. I do this

566
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,480
in my bathroom. I'll talk to you from New York. Next time we speak, which will be on Monday,

567
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,560
have yourself a great weekend, data source code dot com for the show notes for information about

568
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,840
the songs that I've played today, everything else. And of course, you can always email the

569
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:12,640

570
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,880
