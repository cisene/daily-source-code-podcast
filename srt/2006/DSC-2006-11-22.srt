00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,280
With the real potfathers stand up,

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,960
Ricky J. Ves, Adam Kerry, to potfathers, what the fuck?

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,080
You know, I think you have to fist fight to solve this problem. Ricky, where are you writing?

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,080
Is it too much for you to hand the Ricky?

8
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:06,960
Stand back and watch me shine, stand back and watch me shine, stand back and watch me shine,

9
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,960
stand back and watch me shine.

10
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:20,640
Don't worry, I've made a way and got my life inside.

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:32,880
We're changing for the moment when it will look longer high.

12
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:40,880
Steve, inside me is a spark and when I feel it's time,

13
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:50,880
I will release it from the hot stand back and watch me shine, stand back and watch me shine,

14
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,880
stand back and watch me shine, don't stand back and watch me shine,

15
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:07,920
I am everything, and I am nothing, I am yours, and you are mine,

16
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:21,840
I'm primitive, I have the power for it is don't you as I can shine,

17
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:31,840
so watch me shine, I will possess a second of your time, will be mine just for a while,

18
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:41,840
so stand back and watch me shine, stand back and watch me shine, stand back and watch me shine,

19
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,840
stand back and watch me shine.

20
00:02:51,840 --> 00:03:03,840
Steve, inside me is a spark and when I feel it's time,

21
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:13,840
I will release it from the hot stand back and watch me shine,

22
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:21,840
I will release it from the hot stand back and watch me shine,

23
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,840
stand back and watch me shine, stand back and watch me shine,

24
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,840
stand back and watch me shine, stand back and watch me shine,

25
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,840
stand back and watch me shine.

26
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,840
stand back and watch me shine,

27
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:53,120
I'm so wish I could say it was pot safe, but we're not quite there yet.

28
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,120
This is a song that's been stuck in my head for the past couple of weeks, because it's

29
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,480
the theme tune to In the Attic.

30
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,840
That's the show we have going on now with the P-Tounsend, his better half Rachel Fuller,

31
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,280
Pete's Brother, Simon Townsend.

32
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:14,520
If you find it at In the Attic.com, of course, Pete and Rachel and Simon also have profiles

33
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,880
on Potch-O-Plus, BT Potch-O.com to be exact, but you can get to it from Potch-O.com or

34
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,120
from BT Potch-O, Rachel Fuller. Potch-O.com, Pete Townsend.potch-O.com, and that song is just,

35
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,200
it's been haunting me, and I sent an email to Rachel and I said, I really want to play

36
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,760
that on my show, knowing, by the way, that Michael Butler is hot on her trail to get some

37
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,160
first stuff up on the P-M-N, as well as, of course, he's going to go after some of the

38
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,160
who stuff.

39
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:47,560
But if you want some classic, unleashed, unhinged, who tracks acoustic, Pete Townsend with

40
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,440
the other celebrity musicians, you definitely want to check out in the Attic.potch-O.com.

41
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,240
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

42
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,080
Coming to you from, yeah, again, a very misty Northern California from the Curricando

43
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,080
and San Francisco.

44
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,720
I've got a lot of stuff we're going to talk about today, but before we do anything,

45
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,720
big news, and I'm trying to get a date on this.

46
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,720
This is from the AFP, I don't know what the AFP is.

47
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,720
It's a different type of news organization.

48
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:25,720
Anyway, the Hague, in-suit, no, that's not the word, in-so-scient, I've never seen this word

49
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:34,400
before my life, INS-O-U-C-I-A-N-T, in-so, despite police warnings, a Dutch group

50
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,960
was reportedly set to roll the world's biggest joint, sending the previous record for a

51
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,000
marijuana cigarette up in smoke.

52
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,080
I love it how those news guys write.

53
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:52,400
The world's largest joint will be a 500 gram, that's 17 ounces, meter long, 3.3 feet long,

54
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,240
monstrosity, rolled with cigarette paper and easily dwarfing the previous 100 gram winner.

55
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:05,000
The ANP news agency said, I guess, the AFP copies from the ANP, to beat the record, it must

56
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,120
be made entirely of marijuana, with no tobacco mix.

57
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,200
Afterwards, we'll light it up, predict the event organizer, Tice for Hay, who is hoping

58
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,640
his feet will land in the Guinness Book of Records.

59
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,280
Well, dude, Ricky Javez can get in there, I'm sure this can get in there.

60
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,080
The Dutch police are not amused, however, warning they will intervene if the joint surpasses

61
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,080
the five grams of marijuana allowed for consumption and selling the Netherlands.

62
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,720
I'll get arrested with you guys.

63
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,120
Let me know, please tell me.

64
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,800
Tell me one and where this is going to take place.

65
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,960
I need to be a part of it, and let me know on time because I'm going to be needing to

66
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
hotel room.

67
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,000
It's Bernie from Bernie's world.

68
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Congrats on making it to 500 and beyond.

69
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,160
It's got to be hard being away from your family on Thanksgiving, but as the jersey dude

70
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:56,160
with a bunch of Europeans for family, Thanksgiving in the UK must be strangely unceremonial.

71
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,640
Well, you know that there is no Thanksgiving outside of the United States.

72
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,160
The Thanksgiving was done here because the people who left the UK, I think that there

73
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,480
may be some version of Thanksgiving in the UK, probably a good riddance.

74
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,880
Hope while you're here, you get together with some good friends for the day.

75
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,200
I have to tell you, hearing you, Leo and John and Conflict to sent my podcasting world

76
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
into a tailspin.

77
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,320
I mean, if the rumor girls were to jump in, well, that would make great video, but seriously,

78
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,720
this is about you.

79
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,560
Go on to it and set those dudes straight.

80
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,600
I love them, but sometimes they're just talking out their asses.

81
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,600
One more thing.

82
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,600
I don't know who this is, but stop fucking call in Giselle and it's all a happy Thanksgiving.

83
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
It wasn't you.

84
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,440
No, I didn't sound like you.

85
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,440
Hi, I do have a shoot, where is it?

86
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,440
I got another email from Giselle, I think.

87
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,440
Let me see.

88
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,440
Here it is.

89
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,440
Honey, this is from Giselle.

90
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,440
I haven't been able to listen to your show since Monday and I'm so bummed.

91
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,440
I missed the sound of your voice in my ears.

92
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,440
As promised, I'm going to get on a train tomorrow.

93
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,440
I come up there, but since I have to take a seven hour bus ride from Santa Barbara,

94
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,440
I probably won't get in until very late.

95
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,440
I'll call you when I get there if you're up who knows.

96
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,440
Just have my number.

97
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
Thank God.

98
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,440
But if not, I'll hang out and call you back in the morning.

99
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,440
I've never seen Frisco before, so maybe you can show me around.

100
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
Maybe you could be Frisco.

101
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Yeah, I know I'm corny, but I'm also horny.

102
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,440
Love Giselle.

103
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
P.S.

104
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,440
I hope it's warm because I'm bringing it short skirt.

105
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,440
No, no, it's where long pants.

106
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
P.P.S.

107
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Hope you like surprises because I have another one for you.

108
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,440
You know, now I'm really just curious.

109
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,440
At this point, I just really, I really want to meet this woman.

110
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
No girl.

111
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,440
I don't even know how old she is.

112
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,440
I do not repeat, do not want to meet the guy who called up and said,

113
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,440
stop fucking calling to Zell.

114
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
That I'm not into.

115
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,440
I do have plans for Thanksgiving, though.

116
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,440
I've been invited to hang out with some of Podgeo folks who are all getting together.

117
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,440
A lot of people from out of town out of state gathering has going to be a lot of fun.

118
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,440
I'm thinking I'll make my famous stuffing.

119
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
That's one thing I do.

120
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
I do know how to make stuffing.

121
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Of course, I have to take it over there and actually stuff it into the turkey.

122
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
I guess we're having turkey.

123
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
I've got to find out more about that today.

124
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,440
So yeah, this twit thing.

125
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
It's pretty interesting.

126
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
Lots of people sending in comments.

127
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Hey Adam, this is Chris from Naperville, Illinois.

128
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,440
And I was just listening to this week in tech number 77.

129
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,440
Thought you might be interested in checking it out around the 50 minute mark or so.

130
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,440
Well, Leo offered up 20 bucks if you would come on their show after hearing that.

131
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:59,440
You always download the episodes with the Vorac and I'm, but, of course, this was after he said you look like grandpa monster and were 63.

132
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,440
Although, I do think you're actually younger than Leo.

133
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,440
So I think it might be interesting if you just kind of shoot him an email and pop on the show.

134
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
Tell us.

135
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
Oh, you mean, oh, tell us dude.

136
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,440
Don't even act shortly.

137
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,440
I'm definitely younger than Leo Leport.

138
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Yeah.

139
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Well, we get to work it out.

140
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
I'll go on.

141
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,440
But I want to make sure to Vorac is on.

142
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
And I'm sure we're going to have a great time.

143
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
And I, but I definitely want to talk to that.

144
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:28,440
That's so called journalist who, uh, who was just kind of making fun of me after I was kind.

145
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
Then I have to speak with him.

146
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Didn't I give him an interview?

147
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,440
Didn't we have a nice chat?

148
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Uh, you know, it's very hard for Americans to understand if you've never been over to Europe.

149
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,440
If you've never been to the UK, it's very hard to understand what the media landscape is like.

150
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Now, you have to understand that for many, many years, the only television you really could get was BBC 1, BBC 2.

151
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Uh, and I guess ITV came along later.

152
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:01,440
But really, there's a very small amount of television stations out there is sad light now and there is some cable.

153
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:08,440
But a lot of people still get their signal straight off of the rabbit ears, although that is changing over the course of the next couple years.

154
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:15,440
But still, like you have relatively few commercial stations and nothing quite as localized that is commercial the way it is in the US.

155
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,440
We have, um, like, what is, uh, what does NBC over here in San Francisco?

156
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,440
I think it's channel 2 or 5.

157
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
I don't know.

158
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
I was in New York.

159
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
You have WNBC, it's channel 4.

160
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:34,440
You know, they're both commercial entities and they, in some form belong to the NBC network, but they also carry local programming.

161
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,440
You know, how many radio stations are there in the United States?

162
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,440
Several thousand radio stations in the UK.

163
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,440
Very similar situation.

164
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,440
For many, many years, it was basically the BBC.

165
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
I think they had one, two, three, and four.

166
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,440
I'm not even sure if they had that many for that long.

167
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,440
But that's all non-commercial.

168
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,440
It's a government, uh, which, of course, means a government owned owned by the people.

169
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,440
But there's, it's a non-commercial system.

170
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,440
And of course, very few people can actually be on the radio in the UK.

171
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Now, um, lots more commercial stations have cropped up.

172
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,440
But, you know, they've, they've kind of run into the problem that all broadcasts, all traditional broadcast media are seeing is that people are.

173
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:19,440
Basically, um, leaving, um, you know, the program at Fermi version of what the BBC might do.

174
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
And they're filling up their iPods.

175
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,440
And of course, that's where podcasting sprouted from is that, uh, look, you know, we can make shows.

176
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,440
And you don't need a huge BBC tower in studios to, to create that.

177
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,440
You can just do it, uh, oh, cast blaster.

178
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Oh, remind me to talk about that later on.

179
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,440
Cast blaster is a program that was made specifically.

180
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,440
So that, just about anybody could put together a show.

181
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,440
Just like the famous Chris Moiles in the United Kingdom.

182
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
Chris Moiles does the morning show.

183
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,440
I don't know how long he's been doing it.

184
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,440
Uh, and I know a couple of the, the previous morning guys.

185
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,440
And this is like the prestigious spot on radio in the UK is to do the, uh, the BBC breakfast show.

186
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,440
Is that what they still call it?

187
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,440
Um, we'll do the morning show on radio one.

188
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,440
And, uh, Christine, then I listen to it sometimes on our way in.

189
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,440
And, uh, I do not know Chris personally.

190
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,440
Um, but a lot of people sent me a link to his show this morning.

191
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:21,440
Now, uh, the BBC, um, they have a kind of like a, what are they call it?

192
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,440
Uh, it's the listen after the show service or whatever, or I missed it service.

193
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,440
And you can listen to, it's really funny because I, I was able to listen to the entire show from the

194
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,440
morning that aired, uh, on Wednesday and in the BBC on the BBC in the UK.

195
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,440
Uh, and, and you can do it through a kind of like their own streaming player.

196
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
And it's really interesting.

197
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
It must be because of the music rights.

198
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,440
And they do play the full, uh, music tracks.

199
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
It's, it's literally a, a rebroadcast of the show.

200
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,440
You can't rewind and you can jump ahead like by 15 minute increments or five minute increments.

201
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,440
So it's kind of kind of hard to, to cue this up.

202
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,440
But I just wanted you to hear.

203
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,440
Folks in the UK is really what I'm talking about.

204
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,440
I want you to hear.

205
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:14,440
Uh, the level of understanding of what podcasting is doing and what podcasting is amongst the mainstream media in the UK.

206
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,440
And I think a lot of people who are creating their own shows,

207
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,440
whether they're audio or video are really going to be smiling when they hear that.

208
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,440
Really are competition because I guess if, you know, we're competing for ears is what we're doing.

209
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,440
We're competing for ears.

210
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
Some are competing for eyeballs.

211
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,440
Uh, the competition is fairly fucking clueless.

212
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
Let's just listen to this bit.

213
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
This is the Chris Moile show from this morning.

214
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
I mean, you've only moved around the court.

215
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,440
I mean, we've got two streets one.

216
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,440
No.

217
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,440
But 10 minutes, right?

218
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,440
And that's is, I guess, this morning crew or whatever.

219
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,440
And then I'm just coming back in.

220
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,440
There's about a minute left to play on the Justin Timberlake track.

221
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,440
And I walked past Michelle the cleaner.

222
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,440
He went out to take a dump during the Justin Timberlake track.

223
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,440
And he came back and he walks past the cleaner who apparently is a foreigner.

224
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Because he makes it a bit of a joke about that as well.

225
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
Is he not finished yet?

226
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
No.

227
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
He's very thorough.

228
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
Right, thorough.

229
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,440
In all fairness, you know, I've seen I swear.

230
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,440
And I saw this for the day.

231
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,440
I saw a cleaner upstairs by one of the desks with a duster, right?

232
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Kind of waving it over a desk like that.

233
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,440
Just kind of like, I can't fast forward through this piece.

234
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Unfortunately.

235
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
That desto next one.

236
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,440
They didn't actually clean it.

237
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,440
They just kind of, the breeze from the loft of the Justin.

238
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Come on.

239
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
Come on.

240
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,440
Get to your story, Chris.

241
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440
Some papers, but that's about it.

242
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,440
Yeah.

243
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
Well, as Michelle's very thorough.

244
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,440
And he also has to do a smoking rate, which is at his grace when we get in the morning.

245
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,440
I don't know what Colin Murray doesn't there at night time.

246
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
But there's tab ends.

247
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,440
I think they fighting there.

248
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,440
I think he has a wrestling match with his pretty.

249
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,440
Ah, I see.

250
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,440
They got to talk about the night guy in your typical morning show radio banter.

251
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,440
The 10 minutes before you guys on the air just to get him all fired up.

252
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,440
Apparently he's right.

253
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Fight me.

254
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
What?

255
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,440
He's moved apparently.

256
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
Yes, he has.

257
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
He's now on a 10 o'clock at night.

258
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,440
Yeah, he's moved to week day evenings.

259
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
Come on.

260
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
That's right.

261
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,440
So anyway, Michelle the cleaner says to me, I'm just walking past the mic.

262
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,440
You're right.

263
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,440
I've got to get back into the studio because my record ends.

264
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,440
But he wants to ask me just a very quick question.

265
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
She has a very quick answer.

266
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Chris.

267
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
I'm just a Chris podcast.

268
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,440
He doesn't ask you questions.

269
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,440
He just says words.

270
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,440
And then you have to work out what he's on.

271
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,440
Well, podcast.

272
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,440
Nice wanker.

273
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,440
Don't make fun of me the way people talk, man.

274
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,940
Especially people that clean your ship because they're also the people that will piss

275
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,940
in your coffee, okay?

276
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,940
Yeah, and I'm there halfway through the door.

277
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,940
You know when you walk in, so when you go, what about it?

278
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,940
You stay down under the podcast.

279
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,940
Yeah?

280
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,940
What about it?

281
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,940
What what's that?

282
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,940
What?

283
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,940
What is it?

284
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,940
What does that mean?

285
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,940
Oh, it's like an internet.

286
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,940
I want you to listen really carefully.

287
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,940
So I think when by the time I get to the end of this story, which he's drawing out,

288
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:03,940
you'll realize that the person who is cleaning for Chris Moiles understands extremely well

289
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,940
what a podcast is.

290
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,940
And it's probably listening to, it's probably listening to Pacific Coast Hellway

291
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,940
on his, on his iPod.

292
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:15,940
He's probably trying to tell Chris Moiles that he's listening to something more entertaining than what he's doing.

293
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,940
You download it.

294
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,940
What is it?

295
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,940
Jingle.

296
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,940
No, it's, oh, I don't know.

297
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,940
It's a show.

298
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,940
Anyway, okay.

299
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,940
That was it.

300
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:31,940
So Dave, you know, when you try and get your head round what podcast style had to download,

301
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,940
it's similar to this.

302
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,940
It's something you'd out.

303
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,940
It's a show you download.

304
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,940
Okay?

305
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,940
Brilliant.

306
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,940
I understand what a podcast is.

307
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,940
And I know that it goes onto your pod machine and stuff.

308
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,940
Put me in this.

309
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,940
You're pod machine.

310
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,940
It's because they can't say commercial brand names.

311
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,940
They can't say iPod.

312
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,940
Same category.

313
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,940
I understand.

314
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,940
Well, yeah.

315
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,940
He understood it straight away.

316
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,940
Yeah, so do I.

317
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,940
How many podcasts have you downloaded ever?

318
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,940
Ever?

319
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,940
Yeah.

320
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,940
None.

321
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,940
There you go.

322
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,940
Dumb.

323
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,940
Are you a podcast to listen to on the computer screen?

324
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,940
Right.

325
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,940
At work.

326
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,940
Right.

327
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,940
By clicking on download the podcast.

328
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,940
That guy switched on.

329
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,940
Don't listen again, though.

330
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,940
That's good.

331
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,940
Listen again.

332
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,940
I used to.

333
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,940
I used to download Adam Curry's podcast.

334
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,940
Did you?

335
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,940
Yeah.

336
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,940
He's the pod father.

337
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,940
Easy.

338
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,940
Yeah.

339
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,940
He's pretty.

340
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,940
They they reckon that he's the man who invented podcasts.

341
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,940
Really.

342
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,940
Yeah.

343
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,940
Which is kind of like.

344
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,940
Well, I don't know how you can invent it because it kind of just happens.

345
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,940
Yeah.

346
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,940
But now he's kind of creditors as I was the first one.

347
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,940
And he's to do this.

348
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,940
I don't know if he still does it probably still does.

349
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,940
Like a review of really bizarre podcasts around the world.

350
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,940
And one of the first ones I've heard was extracts from a podcast which a pilot does.

351
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,940
He's an airline pilot.

352
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,940
And they he recorded, basically, the conversations that airline pilots have.

353
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,940
Because you know, when you're.

354
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,940
As you know, because we're all trying to find a source.

355
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,940
Well, yes.

356
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,940
Some of us actually are Chris.

357
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,940
If you're a pilot and you're flying to New York, one show up in the air.

358
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,940
All right.

359
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,940
Anyway.

360
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,940
So that was really interesting to me because I know exactly what show that was.

361
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,940
And that was pod finder.

362
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,940
And that was the I think the very first pod finder that included come fly with me with Joe

363
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,940
Deon.

364
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,940
And I truly believe the Chris Moiles listened to.

365
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,940
You know, one or two podcasts when you heard about it and he's not interesting.

366
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,940
King because I have the transmitters.

367
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,940
And he hasn't listened since it sounds like some of his crew there.

368
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,940
Listen, listen more regularly to podcast podcasts.

369
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,940
I should say Chris, I just want you to know one thing.

370
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,940
And I know that this will get to you and I know that.

371
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,940
I know you'll hear it.

372
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,940
Uh, about.

373
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,940
Um, was it just before we launched with the BT pod show.com.

374
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:07,940
So that your boss, um, called us begging and literally begging to have BBC radio

375
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,940
one content included on BT pod show.com.

376
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,940
And it was pretty interesting because at that time we were literally

377
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:19,940
considering, uh, do we want to put any mainstream stuff on BT pod show.com?

378
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,940
Do we want to put anything that's mainstream?

379
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,940
Any mainstream podcast in the UK onto BT pod show.com.

380
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,940
And, uh, and honestly, we had already decided to do it.

381
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:33,940
Uh, because we feel that, you know, why would we want anyone to not be able to get to something

382
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,940
if you're making it available?

383
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,940
But, uh, you may not understand Chris.

384
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,940
Well, your bosses do man.

385
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,940
And maybe just maybe you should take a look at your ratings.

386
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,940
Hi, my name's Bob Bulls.

387
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,940
And I wonder if I could talk to you.

388
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,940
I'm, uh, producing some content on a commercial basis.

389
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,940
And I wonder if there's something that I could speak to.

390
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,940
Would you be so kind of to call me on O7?

391
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,940
So here's the guy who, uh, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't want you to hear the phone number.

392
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,940
Okay.

393
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,940
Hold on, listen to this.

394
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,940
Um, and the content is evolving a very high profile comedian.

395
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,940
Um, I'll tell you more of you call me thanks very much.

396
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,940
Chris, that's what's happening.

397
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,940
Okay.

398
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,940
That's what's happening in your backyard son.

399
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,940
Hi, Steve Web here.

400
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,940
Merry Christmas.

401
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:39,940
James Cooper and I are having a lot of fun putting the life spring admin calendar together for you.

402
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,940
And this very short podcast is to ask you to participate.

403
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,940
Yes, you can be a part of the show.

404
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,940
I know that people from all around the world will be hearing this and that of all those people.

405
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,940
Many of you speak languages other than English.

406
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,940
And many of you know how to say Merry Christmas in other languages.

407
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:04,940
It would be just fantastic if you would record yourself saying Merry Christmas in a language other than English.

408
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:10,940
Record an MP3 for me and send it to Steve.livesprayingatgmail.com or phone my listener comment line at

409
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,940
plus one two zero six three five zero call.

410
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,940
You can identify yourself where you're from and what language your Merry Christmas is in.

411
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,940
Come on, represent your country.

412
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,940
And thanks for joining in.

413
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:30,940
I'm Steve Web, the host of the life spring family podcasts and co-host with James Cooper of the life spring admin calendar.

414
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,940
And we'll be talking to you on December 1st.

415
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,940
Alright, Steve.

416
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,940
Good deal, man.

417
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,940
I'm sure people will send that in.

418
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,940
I seem to remember that the host of this show speaks Dutch.

419
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,940
Yeah, for all the cast faced in a colloquial new year.

420
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,940
Some really stupid happened.

421
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,940
You really know you're growing when this happens.

422
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,940
So, you know, how long have I been working on cast blaster?

423
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,940
How long have I been using cast blaster?

424
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,940
How long have we been talking about it?

425
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:10,940
Cast blaster, of course, a piece of software that enables you to create podcasts really professional podcasts

426
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,940
because you've got the same stuff as any...

427
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,940
You've got the same stuff as Chris Moiles, basically.

428
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,940
You're body weight may vary.

429
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,940
And you can find it at castblaster.com.

430
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,940
And we've made this thing very slick.

431
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,940
It integrates completely with the podcast delivery network.

432
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:36,940
When you sign up to do a show at Pod Show, you can use cast blaster just one program.

433
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,940
And it'll record your show.

434
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,940
You're information, your show notes.

435
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,940
Any other types of data you want to...

436
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,940
You want to have up there.

437
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,940
And you just hit, you know, publish.

438
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,940
And it sends it all up to Pod Show.

439
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,940
And it puts it right into your feed and does everything automatically.

440
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,940
So, we've actually been working on that for over a year.

441
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:05,940
Mike, for state, is the only developer on cast blaster is now working on a video version.

442
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:10,940
And yeah, actually, you can see that at testing123.podshow.com.

443
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,940
And he's doing some cool shit.

444
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,940
He's got, you can plug in multiple USB cameras.

445
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,940
Yes, it's here, it was blended up.

446
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,940
And you can switch back and forth and you can start to clip.

447
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,940
So, it's going to be fantastic.

448
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,940
I've not used an alpha version of it yet myself.

449
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,940
But something really messed up happened.

450
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,940
I want to apologize to Mike and set the record straight.

451
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,940
And also, you know, that's why I do a lot of the stuff in the daily source code is because people

452
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:43,940
the company listened to it and they learned about it as well.

453
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,940
So, yesterday we had a problem.

454
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,940
I noticed it early as I was, you probably saw that the show was up later than normal.

455
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,940
Because every time I tried to upload with cast blaster, it would throw an error message.

456
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,940
And it would say, you know, whoops.

457
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,940
Not working.

458
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,940
So, of course, I immediately called...

459
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,940
I'm just looking for the email here.

460
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,940
I immediately called the Andrew and said, oh, dude.

461
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,940
Now, we got to fix this.

462
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:15,940
And, of course, if it happened to me, then it happened to other people as well.

463
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,940
Oh, no.

464
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,940
And I can't find the email.

465
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,940
I thought I'd copy the right email, but I didn't do it.

466
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,940
So, Mike sent me a note this morning.

467
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,940
You know, if there's a problem with podshow plus,

468
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,940
at the bottom of every single page, there's a link.

469
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,940
One is for listener support.

470
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,940
If you're having issues getting shows,

471
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,940
listening to shows, understanding however it works.

472
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,940
And then there's one for podcaster support.

473
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,940
And it goes right into a real tracking system.

474
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,940
So, you get a ticket number as a sign.

475
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,940
So, we can track it and make sure the problem was resolved.

476
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:49,940
So, apparently, a ticket went in for this very problem.

477
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,940
Because people are using the cast blaster.

478
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,940
And, you know, when it doesn't work for me,

479
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,940
he's not going to work for lots of people.

480
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,940
And the answer that came back from podshow podcaster support

481
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,940
was, and I quote,

482
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,940
as cast blasters, a third party application.

483
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,940
And it appears that something is wrong with this set up

484
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,940
of this third party application.

485
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,940
You will need to contact the folks at cast blaster directly.

486
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,940
Fortunately, they are a great group of folks.

487
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,940
I'm very helpful.

488
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,940
We apologize that we were unable to assess what does this

489
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,940
with troubleshooting third party applications.

490
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,940
We appreciate your understanding.

491
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,940
And, of course, Mike is like,

492
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,940
what the hell is that?

493
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,940
First of all, the nice folks is one guy.

494
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,940
Well, there's people on the forums like Barry,

495
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,940
and there's people who help moderate the forums.

496
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,940
But it's, you know, we go on the product.

497
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,940
So, anyway, it's working now.

498
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,940
And this is also, you know,

499
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,940
and it's so cool to be able to be in San Francisco,

500
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,940
even if it's, you know, like a weird vacation short week.

501
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,940
There's a whole bunch of small things.

502
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,940
You just, you know, this is why I'm not a big fan of working

503
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,940
over long distance.

504
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,940
Because there's so many small nuance.

505
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,940
There's so many little things.

506
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,940
You just miss, you know.

507
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,940
Yeah, everyone knows exactly what they're doing.

508
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,940
And, and, you know,

509
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,940
and it's a process that's been done for 30 years.

510
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,940
Yeah, maybe it'll work very well at long distance.

511
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,940
But now I can, now I can feel all of the sounds like,

512
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,940
oh, now I know why I'm not seeing a lot of cast blaster promotion

513
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,940
in places where I'd expect it like garage.podshow.com

514
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,940
is because they probably think it's a third party application

515
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,940
and it has a very low priority,

516
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,940
which, by the way, also isn't right

517
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,940
because if people are making shit that works with our shit,

518
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,940
which smell on that shit.

519
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,940
So anyway, apologies to Mike and everyone

520
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,940
who's been working so hard on cast blaster.

521
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,940
And, as I said, it is working again,

522
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,940
so that, of course, is the good news.

523
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,940
Love to hear from you.

524
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,940
Little low on the phone calls now in the US.

525
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,940
Plus 4.4.

526
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,940
Duo 7.

527
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,940
6.8.

528
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,940
1.

529
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,940
3.7.

530
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,940
5.3.

531
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,940
Plus 4.4.

532
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,940
Duo 7.

533
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,940
6.8.

534
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,940
1.3.

535
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,940
7.5.

536
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,940
3.

537
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,940
And, for those of you in the United States of America,

538
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,940
I just want one, two, one, six, two, five,

539
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,940
six, three, five, seven,

540
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:12,940
last one, two, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven.

541
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,940
Andrew Grommer can't stop singing that one.

542
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,940
Hey, Adam, it's Mark Yoshimoto, Namcov,

543
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,940
and I just want to tell you,

544
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,940
and the Daily Source Code listeners,

545
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,940
that the Shadow Falls experience in second life

546
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,940
is now open.

547
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,940
Remember, a few months ago,

548
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,940
when you said, wouldn't it be cool

549
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,940
to build the town of Shadow Falls in second life?

550
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,940
Well, guess what?

551
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,940
The sexy second life siren Brittany Mason,

552
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,940
put together a cracker jack team of builders,

553
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,940
and they did just that.

554
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,940
They built the whole town.

555
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,940
I mean, it's really cool.

556
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,940
It's like the houses,

557
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,940
and all these buildings,

558
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,940
like the library,

559
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,940
and the police station,

560
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,940
and the diner,

561
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,940
and these woods,

562
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,940
like this really thick forest

563
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,940
that surrounds the whole town on Pacho Island.

564
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,940
It's really creepy.

565
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,940
It's really super cool.

566
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,940
I mean, you got to see it.

567
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,940
It's amazing.

568
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,940
So, first off,

569
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,940
really great idea on your part.

570
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,940
But I wanted everybody to know

571
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,940
that the Shadow Falls experience

572
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,940
is not just this sim,

573
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,940
where you can just walk around

574
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,940
and look around and just hang out.

575
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,940
No, it's more than that.

576
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,940
It's a game.

577
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,940
Tell you what,

578
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,940
I'm going to pitch it to you right now

579
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,940
as if I were at some Hollywood studio.

580
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,940
As if I had like a meeting on the Foxlot,

581
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,940
and I was pitching this to a big movie producer.

582
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,940
Okay, okay.

583
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,940
Hold on a second.

584
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,940
Let me get in my big movie producer role then.

585
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,940
Okay.

586
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,940
Yeah.

587
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,940
Yeah.

588
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,940
Mark, yeah.

589
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,940
You shouldn't mind an echo.

590
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,940
What's up, buddy?

591
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,940
I'd be like,

592
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,940
Adam, okay.

593
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,940
Picture this.

594
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,940
Imagine,

595
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,940
missed meets the Da Vinci code.

596
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,940
missed meets the Da Vinci code.

597
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,940
Get the fuck out of my office.

598
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,940
That's how it would go, Mark.

599
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,940
You go into this game,

600
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,940
and they're these clues.

601
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,940
They're like riddles.

602
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,940
And when you solve these riddles,

603
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,940
they give you little pieces of the puzzle.

604
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,940
And keys that open like secret doors

605
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,940
and combination codes that open up secret boxes.

606
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,940
Let me think.

607
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,940
This idea is getting interesting.

608
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,940
Maybe you should lay down on it on my couch here.

609
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,940
Mark and put on a wig.

610
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,940
Yeah.

611
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,940
Yeah.

612
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,940
Yeah.

613
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,940
Could you just put that dress on that I have over there?

614
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,940
And inside some of these boxes,

615
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,940
some of these treasure chests.

616
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,940
Our head in little pieces of the tragic history of what happened

617
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,940
in Shadow Falls 300 some years ago.

618
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,940
And the only way you could piece together this prequel

619
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,940
is if you solve all the riddles and get all the pieces of the puzzle.

620
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,940
And you do this while you're searching all over Shadow Falls

621
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,940
in second life.

622
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,940
Pretty damn cool, huh?

623
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,940
We'll check out how podcasting ties into it.

624
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,940
Some of the clues come in the form of little audio bits

625
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,940
that I'm going to drop as little mini episodes into the Shadow Falls feed.

626
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,940
And of course, it's like the answers to most of these riddles

627
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:54,940
will be easier to solve if you know your season one of Shadow Falls.

628
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,940
For instance, I'm going to give you audio clue number one.

629
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,940
Here you go, you ready?

630
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,940
Yeah.

631
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:05,940
It begins in the woods where Jacob was done by the big sign.

632
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,940
Karen's friend gives you clue number one.

633
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,940
Let me repeat that.

634
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,940
It begins in the woods where Jacob was done by the big sign.

635
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,940
Karen's friend gives you clue number one.

636
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,940
Let me think.

637
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:23,940
I know who Karen's friend was, but what was on the big sign?

638
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,940
Chris Moiles is a wanker.

639
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,940
Game on Adam, can you figure out the riddle of Shadow Falls?

640
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,940
Well, you can.

641
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,940
If you go to the Shadow Falls experience.

642
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,940
Only it's second life at secondlife.com.

643
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,940
And of course, you know, I want everybody to know everybody you can hear this.

644
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,940
The second life is free.

645
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:47,940
You don't need any money to get a, you know, an account and the log on and to go to pod show island

646
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,940
and experience Shadow Falls like you never have before.

647
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:55,940
And while I have your undivided attention, just want to let you know that my new podcast novel number one

648
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,940
with a bullet is on the front page of iTunes.

649
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,940
Well, at least it was today while I was recording this.

650
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,940
And thank you, CC Chapman, for pointing that out to me.

651
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,940
And I'm kind of hoping you do me a solid and play the trailer for it right now.

652
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,940
Thanks.

653
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,940
Adam, I appreciate it.

654
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:15,940
And I'll see you in second life where I'm hoping your avatar doesn't try to grab my ass.

655
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,940
Okay.

656
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,940
I'll catch you later.

657
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,940
Yeah.

658
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,940
I'm so happy that worked out that project.

659
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,940
Brittany Mason has done an incredible job.

660
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,940
I wanted to get on.

661
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,940
Yes.

662
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,940
I'm.

663
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,940
I'm at consmen locked out.

664
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,940
And I have to call the Linden Labs and then whenever I call, you know, I'm like,

665
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,940
Okay, today I'm going to call.

666
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,940
I'm going to get my account on locks.

667
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,940
I can go in and look at shit.

668
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:39,940
And then you know, it's like some worm has been unleashed and you can't get in pain in the ass.

669
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,940
So I guess everything's up now.

670
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,940
But I know Brittany Mason did a phenomenal job on that.

671
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,940
And it's really interesting when you do an episodic series like this.

672
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,940
So what do we do six episodes of Shadow Falls for the season one?

673
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,940
So we want to do season two, which, of course, is all in the plan in the works.

674
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,940
But a lot of people have already heard the six episodes.

675
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,940
And you know, what we're doing now is we're really working on this fantastic,

676
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,940
you know, piece of work for new people who come into the network.

677
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,940
And there are new people who are learning about podcasting every day.

678
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,940
Just imagine if Chris Moiles could actually hear this.

679
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:18,940
If we actually got through to him through his thick skull.

680
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,940
You know, so that's what all these things are for.

681
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:26,940
Now there is also quite a community around the back story and Mark has been doing these

682
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,940
very interesting projects to follow.

683
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,940
I love the fact that it's branching out now into into second life.

684
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,940
So that's I think that's a very interesting way of tying people in.

685
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,940
Because as you know, in second life, you can't do it on volume.

686
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,940
He really can't.

687
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,940
All right.

688
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,940
So this other show Mark's talking about number one with a bullet,

689
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,940
which is, was it a pod novel?

690
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,940
God, this sounds really good.

691
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,940
He already has like a writer's prologue.

692
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:00,940
I guess there's what it's called up on the feed for number one with a bullet.

693
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,940
And then he sends me this promo.

694
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,940
This teaser to play for you.

695
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:11,940
And it is the guy who reads this and I'm not mistaken is he is the guy that does all those movie trailers.

696
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:17,940
You know, the in a world where women wear comfortable shoes.

697
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,940
I'm really insanely jealous of it.

698
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,940
Have a listen.

699
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,940
Top 10 Hitman face off.

700
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:29,940
You know, last man's standing winner take all contest being bet on by some of the world's richest men.

701
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,940
The only rule is to stay alive.

702
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:42,940
And for Johnny Dane, it means finding out that getting out of the business doesn't mean getting out of the game.

703
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:49,940
From the mind of Mark Yoshimoto Namcoff, the creator of Shadow Falls comes number one with a bullet.

704
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:56,940
The free serialized audio book guaranteed to put your adrenaline in the crosshairs.

705
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:02,940
Get on target at number one bullet dot pod show dot com.

706
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,940
Oh, man.

707
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,940
I love that guy's voice.

708
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,940
Because when he says something, you're like, damn, I got to go listen to that show.

709
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,940
There's just no two ways about it.

710
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,940
The guy with the heavy voice told me to do it.

711
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,940
And to do some to me, Mark, please.

712
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:26,940
I want to get a couple of those for myself.

713
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,940
Some pod save music to wind it up for today.

714
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:34,940
My friend Jimmy Golding, who's true character from London.

715
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,940
It's the rocket to the moon.

716
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,940
We're in making a lost food drama.

717
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:57,940
We share the midnight feast.

718
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:01,940
Look the space machine has landed.

719
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,940
We shot it and we screamed.

720
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,940
We want to rock it.

721
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:12,940
To the light of the moon.

722
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:19,940
We share the midnight feast.

723
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,940
We want to rock it.

724
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,940
We share the midnight feast.

725
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:33,940
We share the midnight feast.

726
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:39,940
We share the midnight feast.

727
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:50,940
We've made astronauts with so much and steps on the bed.

728
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,940
We said I love so funny.

729
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:58,940
With the gulfing gold on my head.

730
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,940
And we stayed at night to watch the moon.

731
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,940
Making history.

732
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:11,940
We're in making history.

733
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,940
We're in making history.

734
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:21,940
We're in making history.

735
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:27,940
We're in making history.

736
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:33,940
We're in making history.

737
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:43,940
We're in making history.

738
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:53,940
We're in making history.

739
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,940
There's a guy I got to hang out with more.

740
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:08,940
Jimmy Golding.

741
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:24,940
He's just exactly what you think of a really hit British artist.

742
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:34,940
He's a great star.

743
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:44,940
I was like six years old, five or six years old watching Neil Armstrong on the moon.

744
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,940
I just want to clear up because I think there was some misinterpretation.

745
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:56,940
I'm not going to say anything about the national health care service in the UK.

746
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,940
Listen to this comment.

747
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:06,940
I'm not going to play the whole thing, but this guy told me it's understood what I was saying.

748
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:16,940
I'm going to get picked up on this book.

749
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,940
You really need a big careful of what you say.

750
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:26,940
I don't mean that as a threat.

751
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,940
I just mean get you fuck script before you start having a go at an organisation that is the pride of the country.

752
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:40,940
I don't even know what I'm going to say.

753
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:45,940
That's what I just want to get rid of.

754
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:51,940
I thought I was clear.

755
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,940
This is what we were talking about in the United States for years and never been able to get together.

756
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,940
I love that fact.

757
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:02,940
It's a very difficult thing to put into place as we've already seen.

758
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:09,940
I found out that it would take three weeks of agonizing pain for my daughter to be walking around with her.

759
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:15,940
Perhaps cartilage floating around her knee before she could even get an MRI to see if there was cartilage in her knee.

760
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,940
Let alone before she can get the operation.

761
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:26,940
Those are the drawbacks of a healthcare system because despite the fact that there are MRI machines standing empty.

762
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,940
And it's just a matter of money, which of course is what it always comes down to.

763
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,940
But I don't know, please don't let us misunderstand me.

764
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:42,940
I love the fact that people under 16 or over 16 if you're still in school, they get free healthcare.

765
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,940
Are you kidding me? This is fucking phenomenal.

766
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:49,940
All I'm saying is there's always a lot of complaints because people die.

767
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,940
And then it makes great headlines.

768
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,940
Oh, the guy had to wait three weeks and he died.

769
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,940
So it sucks, but no, please don't get me wrong.

770
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,940
I love the fact that there's a national healthcare system.

771
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:08,940
And I wish I was smart enough to figure out how something like that could work better in the UK and just work it all anywhere else.

772
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,940
No, no, don't get me wrong.

773
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:16,940
So he has not like three minutes of comment, but I just want to say, no, I totally appreciate the NHS.

774
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,940
I think it's a fascinating system.

775
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:24,940
Something that we should look at here in the US for a number of reasons for its success as well as for its failures.

776
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,940
I was just saying that people bitch and moan about this stuff.

777
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:34,940
I mean, you can't win. If you look at the newspapers in the US or look at the newspapers in the UK,

778
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:38,940
whenever it comes to healthcare in the US, you read people are dying because we have no healthcare.

779
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:42,940
And the UK, you read people are dying because we have shitty healthcare.

780
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:46,940
And of course, it's not true. Any healthcare is better than no healthcare.

781
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,940
Do you guys all, is it, is dental also included in the NHS?

782
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,940
I bet it is. I'll bet it is.

783
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:58,940
You can't even, you know, that I can't even ensure Patricia privately for, for dental.

784
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:03,940
I mean, once you're, I can't do it for myself anymore. Once you're over 40, forget about it.

785
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:07,940
You know, because that's when shit just keeps falling out of your head.

786
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,940
It's also a myth, by the way, that English people's teeth are bad.

787
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:17,940
That may have been two generations ago, but you should look at Christina's new boyfriend's teeth.

788
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,940
Oh, man. What a pretty boy that is.

789
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,940
Hey, everybody. So tomorrow, thanksgiving.

790
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,940
I'll be celebrating here with a couple of folks from Podshow.

791
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:31,940
You may be on your way. You may be on the plane listening to this as you're going to go see family.

792
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:37,940
Whatever you're doing, be safe, be happy, enjoy the time with your loved ones.

793
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:41,940
I'll probably be doing a show. I don't know if I'll do one tomorrow, but Friday for sure.

794
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,940
Maybe not the same time since I don't have to hit any satellite windows.

795
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:53,940
And I'd have to say that I'm thankful, obviously, for the health of my family.

796
00:42:53,940 --> 00:43:00,940
And for everyone being strong through an interesting year.

797
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:07,940
And I really want to thank everybody who was participating in this thing we call podcasting.

798
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:13,940
If it'll be called that forever I doubt, but there's something really special going on.

799
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:19,940
And it's for people who are making people who are bacon and people who are just listening to them, people who are enjoying them.

800
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:24,940
And thank you all for sending me stuff and helping me out and keeping me going.

801
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,940
Oh, yeah.

802
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:31,940
Please, I'm thankful for people who make pig ass joints that are going to try and set world records.

803
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,940
I'll talk to you later guys. Bye-bye.

804
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,940
Another pod show podcast.

805
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,940
Stick it in your ear.

806
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:51,940
Get this pod cast and we're great ones like it on the high performance pod cast delivery network from Pod Show and line-white networks.

807
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,940
I love it.
