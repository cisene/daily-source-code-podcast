Hello everyone, this is Karen, you joy-rise queen, wanting to wish you all a very relaxed Christmas.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Stay tuned with joy-rise.btpotchow.com.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello, is this thing on?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You're saying you're coming, you're loud and clear.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, Adam, I've been looking at your list and well.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Based on the drug trafficking laws on several countries,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not going to be able to get you most of what you've asked for,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but how about we just get you a nice pretty sweater and some extra hair spray

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and maybe a cowbell for the condo.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Anyway, Adam, have a happy holidays and, oh, oh, oh, enjoy yourself

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
on the DSC 517.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh, it's $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Do the next generation radio content in my ears.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We don't need no sticky ingredients in it.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Fantastic kiss, Adam Curry.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Do you remember that it's down my Christmas tree?

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Don't remember anything for waiting for my phone to ring.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Wake up, better freezing.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Drink it doesn't kill my fate.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You're a strange feeling at my window.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Must be Christmas time again.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Just don't know if I know.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No more chance for me.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I love this Christmas never came.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Every year's the same.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh, it was nice.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I got a thing.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I got a thing.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I got a thing.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I got a thing.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I got a thing.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I got a thing.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I got a thing.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I got a thing.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I got a thing.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I got a thing I got a thing.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I got a thing.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
fake Sunday night byaran.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Nukeя兰 Perf cooker battlefield.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
A night deep dead by quits the setting.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Depending on what Christmas party you look at the other way.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I wish I was never born

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
See another glistless thing

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Just for the moment

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No world shines for me

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I wish I was never gay

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Every ever you say

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
For the sake of therapy

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I've got to be by myself again

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I've got to be

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I've got to be by myself

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
With my skin

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I've got to be

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I've got to be by myself

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
With my...

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I've got to be

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I've got to be a lover

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
No one on Christmas day

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Wake up in a freezing

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Take it up and kill my pain

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Tell me if it had my window

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
My secret must time again

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
See you at the Christmas party

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But he asked over the year

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I wish I was never born

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
See another glistless thing

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Just for the moment

No one on Christmas day

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I wish I was never gay

72

I've got to be by myself

I've got to be by myself

I've got to be by myself

81

With my...

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I've got to be

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I've got to be

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No...

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I've got to be

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No one on Christmas day

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I've got to be

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I've got to be

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I've got to be

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I've got to be

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
No one on Christmas day

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
No one on Christmas day

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I know I can't live with you

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I know I can't live with you

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
American Heartbreak

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
On bass, Michael Bloodler, of the Rock and Roll Geek Show

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The greatest Christmas song ever written

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I love the lyric, you know

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You show up to the Christmas party with the asshole of the year

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's daily source code, episode number 517

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Coming to you from Curry Cottage in the affluent suburb of Surrey

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Known as Guilford in the old Cottage

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Still, which won't last too much longer

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And looking outside, have you ever heard of the London fog?

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Well, we've been in it for the past 48 hours

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And it's wreaking havoc on the infrastructure

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Now you have to kind of visualize that Jack the Ripper

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Type fog that is just kind of hanging there

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And doesn't do anything, doesn't move

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's exactly what it's like outside, complete piece soup

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And besides the, you know, we're on an island here, right?

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And with global warming, you know that the United Kingdom is the new Caribbean

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So, ferry boats have had tremendous delays

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Because they literally can't see where they're going

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Very hard to dock

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Because the, well, let's get to the airports

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Heathrow

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Although they've said it's been closed

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The airport hasn't actually closed

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Well, first of all, there's 100,000 people in the airport

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Who are laying around trying to get flights

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Home to Christmas, which God, there's so many songs

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That have been written about this problem

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Most aircraft certainly can take off in this weather

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Because once you get out, you know, then you're above the weather

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And then it's nice and bright and sunshiney

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And I would say that depending, well, about 40% of the time

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
40% to 60% of the time according to the terminal area

130
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
4 casts and the, and other reports

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
40% to 60% of the aircraft can land

132
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The problem is that you've got all kinds of delays

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Because you can't taxi that fast

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You can't see what the heck is going on

135
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
On the runway

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So they have to space the planes much further apart

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I believe there's some de-icing going on

138
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So it's a mess

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Complete mess with flights being canceled

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Absolutely

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And my in-laws are supposed to leave on Saturday

142
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And I gotta tell you, the way the situation is today

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And of course there's zero wind

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And there's like half a knot of wind

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So this fall, if there was wind, the fog could be blown away

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I have a feeling we'll have the in-laws for Christmas

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Ah, yes

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's interesting that there's an airport called Manson Airport

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Which is on the south eastern tip

150
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What's kind of the mid, the mid eastern tip of the United Kingdom

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And it's, we call it the crash, like the crash field

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
In the second world war

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
As a huge runway

154
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I mean it's astronomical this runway

155
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And these days they can actually fill it up with foam

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And that's where a large aircraft would go

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If they had an undercarriage problem

158
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Or had to make some kind of force landing

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's a great spot to do that

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
In World War Two

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It was built literally for the guys who were coming home

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And you know, engine shot off, wheel shot off

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And shit to be able to kind of slide into safety

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And it saved a lot of lives

165
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But what they did to invert the fog

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Was they lit up fires all around the airfield

167
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And it worked

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And I'm wondering, you know, can't we do something like that with Heathrow

169
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Because I'm sure it would work, you know, you start heating that up

170
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And the fog will start to lift a little bit

171
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Anyway, until further notice, it's a real, real mess

172
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Let's see, so much to talk about today on the source code

173
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I've got to get ready

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And you know what that means, it's Thursday

175
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yeah, it is time once again

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's my girl, Amy Mac

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Hey, Amy, how you doing?

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Amy? Amy?

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Hello

180
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Well, Adam, it's day 20

181
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yes, Matt

182
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I feel so much like Christmas being back in the land where season's changed

183
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh, you don't like San Francisco

184
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yesterday I drove from Indiana down to Tennessee

185
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And since I drive a motorcycle in the city

186
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This was like the first time I'd driven in

187
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't know, six months

188
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Let me tell you, I love the roof

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Reverse, I'm being able to listen to DSC

190
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And everyone else is podcast and pot safe music

191
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I forgot how much I missed that

192
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I didn't know she wrote a bike, man, that's kind of hot, Amy

193
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Anyway, just because I'm all Holly Jolly for Christmas

194
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Doesn't mean I'm not gonna kick your butt

195
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes, I need it

196
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So get ready

197
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay, I'm sad, what are we doing here?

198
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Turn on the other mic

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
We've done squats before

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And we've done kicks before

201
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Now, today is our grand finale

202
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What are we doing?

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't know how to use sound effects

204
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Boy, oh, don't do that

205
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We will combine them

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay, I'm ready

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Follow me

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Move the other mic

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Start with your feet, shoulder with a part

210
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay, shoulder with a part

211
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Okay, straight forward

212
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yes, they are

213
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Arms clasped in front of you

214
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Clasped in front of me

215
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Now squat down

216
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And then you squat back up

217
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Your left leg out to the side

218
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And then as you squat back down

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Bring your leg back in

220
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Now, oh, then the other side

221
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Okay, so kick right leg out as you come up

222
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And bring back in as you squat down

223
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay

224
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Seven more, each side

225
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Ready, go

226
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Okay, one

227
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Squat

228
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Kick

229
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Your weight

230
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Squat

231
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Quick

232
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Kick

233
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yes

234
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Wait on your heels

235
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh, none of my toes

236
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Make sure your knees don't come over your toes

237
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Breathe

238
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What number are you on?

239
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Six

240
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And

241
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Squat

242
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Faster, faster

243
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Oh, I love what you say that

244
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I know, that's a favorite

245
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yes

246
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Seven

247
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
All right, great to have

248
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You've done an excellent job in the last 20 weeks

249
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
To make that as firm and spectacular

250
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I need to feel

251
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh yeah, that's good

252
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah, have a wonderful holiday

253
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Everybody

254
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm off to cut down a Christmas tree

255
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah, so until next time

256
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Go kill some nature Amy

257
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Amy sent a lot and I still email along with AstraZeneca

258
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Number 20, which of course is now a pod cast

259
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And she also has the fitness attack

260
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Also available on Espanyol

261
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Gotta cut

262
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What?

263
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Did you do your exercise?

264
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I did my exercise, yeah?

265
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Okay, good

266
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I just want to say I'm going to go Christmas

267
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Go talking to the microphone

268
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm going to go Christmas shopping

269
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah

270
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Do you think the DB9 will fit into your bag?

271
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Oh, absolutely

272
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Fast and Martin

273
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Austin, what does what you want?

274
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The Aston Martin DB9, yes, that kind of fit into your bag

275
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
No

276
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't think so

277
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I don't think so

278
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm leaving in the garage

279
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No, it's a ride of wood

280
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I won't fit in the garage

281
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Okay, you going with your parents?

282
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah, I'm going to entertain them a little bit

283
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah

284
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Okay

285
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I was just saying that if the fog keeps up

286
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
They may be celebrating Christmas with us

287
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It doesn't

288
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't know

289
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Are you already exhausted?

290
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Not okay

291
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's fine

292
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
My parents have a lot of energy

293
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yes, they do

294
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That's why I got it from

295
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah, it's like triple trouble here

296
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Okay, baby

297
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm enjoying

298
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
All right, I love you

299
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Bye

300
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Bye

301
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Ah, yes, the sound proof studio door

302
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Shushing closed

303
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Ah

304
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Anyway, so Amy said that she's going to continue

305
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Doing the exercise in the new year

306
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Which I'm very happy about

307
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Because I don't mind keeping it up

308
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You know, it's paying off

309
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Amy

310
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Day three now

311
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm not being able to send SMS to text messages

312
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Here in the UK

313
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's with the new E61

314
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The Nokia E61

315
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Which I love so much

316
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And yes, they finally got an engineer on the phone from Singier

317
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Because you know, you go through the customer support

318
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And they run down the list

319
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And you know, you're like, I'm almost bored

320
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Because I've done everything already

321
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I know about the message center numbers

322
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I know all this stuff

323
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I really do

324
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Ah

325
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And so I got a phone call

326
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yesterday

327
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And I was like, oh, you sound like an engineer

328
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And guys, how did you know?

329
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I was like, you sound like one

330
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I said, oh, my wife would disagree

331
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And I was like, you know what you're talking about

332
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And I said, my wife would disagree

333
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So at a fun time

334
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And we check some stuff out

335
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And I believe that it is a problem between

336
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Team Oble in the UK and Singular

337
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So that's going to take a little bit of

338
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Sorting out to figure out what's going on there

339
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But lots of people been trying to help me out

340
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It really is much appreciated

341
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I've just got a listening to the DSU-515

342
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And a culture problem with the E-61

343
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I had the same problem

344
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Haven't seen me last summer when I was a

345
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Fisting Czech Republic in kindergarten

346
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Back in Holland

347
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Had the same problem

348
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Somehow somewhere

349
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Something changed in the

350
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Installing it

351
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The configuration

352
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Most likely

353
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Somewhere DDB inside the menu

354
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
There will be the settings

355
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
We said to send text messages as we email

356
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You should change that

357
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So good luck with it

358
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Over

359
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Of course

360
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Folder

361
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah, that was a new one to me

362
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I did check that

363
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I didn't know it's sent to send us text messages

364
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Not as emails

365
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What's interesting is

366
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'd like to try

367
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Roming on a different network

368
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Now here's what's kind of fun

369
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I bought this Nokia at the Nokia store here in the UK

370
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And the manual

371
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Specifies that there's a place in the settings

372
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Where you can change

373
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Manually changed the cellular operator you want to use

374
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Well, that menu option is not existent

375
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
On my version of the phone

376
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I have the latest version of the software

377
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I've updated all of that

378
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I've been through these things a million times

379
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
With a million different gadgets

380
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So I kind of know what to look for

381
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But

382
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I have two menu options on that particular menu

383
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Which does not include manually setting your cellular operator

384
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And the instruction book that says here it is

385
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Here's where the third menu item is

386
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And it's not

387
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So it's very very frustrating

388
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Not to be able to send text messages

389
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Because you know

390
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's how I communicate with my peeps

391
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I completely need it

392
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I think I played these a promo

393
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
By these guys on somewhere around the 400

394
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
On the daily source code

395
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I think I think I have an advertising agency

396
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
But they're still around and that's pretty cool

397
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Hi, this is Matt and this is done

398
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And we're the host of Piotini

399
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The show about the people who make you want the stuff you want

400
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
How they do it

401
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
In other words, Piotini is a show about advertising marketing and branding

402
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
This week we celebrate six months of show

403
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And if you haven't been listening to Piotini

404
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Here's some of what you've missed

405
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Listen, okay, by the year 2010

406
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Traditional TV advertising will be 66% less effective

407
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
As it was in 1990

408
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I can't imagine there's a CMO out there

409
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It gives a rat's ass about CMC

410
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Of course there's a thing

411
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You know at the end of the day

412
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Which has a means of fitting

413
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Add messages inside a urinal

414
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The demographic of fat Americans

415
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
One sin of life time

416
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Come man, as is moldy

417
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Clean around the idea

418
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
One second radio ads

419
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's beyond August

420
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So I'm going to show the person Matt and Don

421
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I have to say I've honestly never thought of a congregation as being a target audience

422
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And all my life of all my career in marketing

423
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That has never crossed my mind until I saw Christ

424
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
The question you've got to ask yourself

425
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What can my product, my service, my way of communicating

426
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
My product, my service, whatever it may be

427
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
How can this make the consumer's life?

428
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
More simple

429
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Well put

430
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Don't forget to tune in each Monday for a brand new potting

431
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And for it again, there's a few people we'd like to think in the podcast and world

432
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
P.K.J. for technical advice

433
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Adam Curry for being the pot father

434
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Chris Penn and Chris Brogan for podcast and Boston and of course our listeners

435
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Thanks for listening

436
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
We look forward to another six months of shows

437
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So there's a lot of talk now about more troops being sent to Iraq

438
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And the situation of course interests me as a

439
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Member of the world community as a citizen of the United States as

440
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And it habitant of the United Kingdom as someone who's been to Iraq and during more time

441
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And we'll read this to you on March 15th, 2006

442
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Members from both parties in Congress supported the creation of the bipartisan Iraq study group to review

443
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The situation on the ground and proposed strategies for the way forward

444
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
For more than eight months the study group met with military officers

445
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
General experts, academics, journalists and high-level government officials from America and abroad

446
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Participants included George W. Bush and members of his cabinet

447
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Bill Clinton, Jalal Talabani, Nuri Kamal Amaliki, General John Abizai, George K.C.

448
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Anthony Zini, Colin Powell, Thomas Friedman, George Packer and many others

449
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
As a official edition contains the group's findings and proposals for improving security

450
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Strengthening the new government rebuilding the economy and infrastructure

451
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And maintaining stability in the region is a highly anticipated and essential

452
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Step forward for Iraq, America and the world

453
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So I picked this up, I know I talked about it on Monday, Tuesday

454
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah, Tuesday, talked about having read this on the plane ride back

455
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And I took away a number of things from it and I really do encourage you to pick it up and have a read

456
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Because you'll see what a complicated situation it is in Iraq

457
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The main problem is that there are religious factions

458
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So you have the Sunis and the Shias

459
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And without getting all the way into who was in power first and who's what and who believes in what

460
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Let's just say it there's within Iraq there are, you know, maybe you could almost say

461
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's red state blue state except it's about religion

462
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Which makes it a little bit more complicated

463
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So when you want to build up the security forces in a country, which is exactly what I saw happening

464
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I saw the ICDC, the Iraqi Civil Defense Initiative, I saw them being trained

465
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Excuse me, I think the ICDC is in front of my door right now

466
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I asked trash guys back and up in the fog

467
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I saw that actually taking place and that's what the focus was

468
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
In particular the Iraqi forces in the form of the military and the police

469
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And the military is that is the ICDC that I speak of

470
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:01,000
The problem is you can teach someone to fight and you can teach someone to maintain order civil order as a police force would do

471
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
But if they have idealistic differences or deeply embedded, you know

472
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And grain differences in their belief system in their beliefs and that there sometimes can actually be a hatred of the other type of belief

473
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
That's going to be a problem because, you know, it's like, well, hold on

474
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Who's protecting who and who's enforcing what and who's right

475
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So it's almost a non-starter and I think that there was a huge lack of knowledge about that going in

476
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And even the training of the forces, I'll be real honest with you

477
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I saw barracks, I saw troops, I saw order, I saw guys following orders

478
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I saw people able to handle weapons

479
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But have you ever seen dad's army?

480
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Have you?

481
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It looked very much like dad's army with the the common dawn would call for a

482
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And about face and half the guys would turn the wrong way

483
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I mean, I literally saw this, we have an video tape somewhere when we were over there

484
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So it was like, okay, these guys are trained, but, you know, it's like real basic training

485
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's not like the marines all of a sudden

486
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And again, you don't know, you know, there could be two guys next to each other in the same

487
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Battalion and hate each other

488
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Or not agree with the views or not agree with the mission at hand

489
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So that's very, very difficult

490
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And crap, trying to get into a serious story here, got the damn garbage guys

491
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's actually the recycling guys

492
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
So if you read through this, the starter report, there's a lot of talk about that

493
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And it seems apparent to me that there was a big mistake that was made

494
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Sometimes in the whole scope of the world

495
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's better to have the dictator you know in power than to have no dictator

496
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Because I think that's basically what made it work

497
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm not saying Saddam Hussein was a good guy

498
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
But I'm saying that a lot of worship appears to have happened after he was taken out of power

499
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And, you know, the real answer should have been that there should have been a very swift replacement of a very strong leading figure

500
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And, you know, there really isn't one

501
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Because, yeah, there's one for the Sunnis, there's one for the Shias

502
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You've got Al-Sadar, you've got the Kurds with 100,000 man army or security forces up north

503
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I mean, it's a claustrophuck, it's a huge, huge, huge problem

504
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And, you know, there's a lot of call in this report for political change

505
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Which essentially means, yeah, you've got to have a leader

506
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You can't have a country pool together without some form of leader

507
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And of course, they've had a couple of leaders who were assassinated

508
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So someone, you know, and I think the U.S. probably has the choice

509
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And this is not exactly what the study group says

510
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
The U.S. has the choice of essentially empowering if we want to get out

511
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Right, if we want to leave this situation

512
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
We've got to support one of these guys and they're going to be a dictator

513
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It probably won't be a democratic process

514
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But that it seems to be the only way that the only solution for maintaining some form of peace

515
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Someone's got to have the upper hand

516
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And it certainly is not the American or the, quote, coalition forces

517
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Because there's just not enough, you know, and the report clearly states that

518
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Yeah, you know, the forces go in and what does it clear and hold

519
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I think is the tactic, so, you know, clear all insurgents

520
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
By the way, are killing their own people, you know, yeah, the killing servicemen in the process

521
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
But it's really targeted it, you know, it's the Sunis versus the Shias

522
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
That's what's going on, it's the jets and the sharks

523
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's the same, the history's always like that

524
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And so the minute they clear something out, you know, behind them, shit starts filling in

525
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So it's like, you know, it's like bringing water to the sea

526
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's just an almost impossible task, except what this report suggests is, you know,

527
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Up the number of troops significantly, and they mean like bringing 50,000 more troops

528
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
That should apparently be enough to maintain the clear and hold strategy

529
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
At the same time, you know, get a democratically elected leader to be a real leader

530
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I'm telling you, this is tough, and I got to say, I think, you know, the neighbouring countries

531
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Have got to step in and do something here, that would be pretty much the only solution I see

532
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And if it wasn't for the oil in the ground, then I will say that

533
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
If it wasn't that this was the world's second largest oil reserve

534
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What would have pulled out of there in a heartbeat

535
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
But you know, there's just way too much at stake there

536
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Those of you listening in on serious satellite stars 102, I appreciate the time

537
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
We've got another three and a half hours to go on the bird for this evening

538
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So you enjoy that, if you want to hear more of the show, just head on over to dailysourcecode.com

539
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And download it like the rest of us

540
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So yeah, so, you know, I encourage you to go out and buy this report

541
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's actually it's expensive, it was like 10 bucks or something, 1095

542
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And a portion of the proceeds from the purchase of this book will be donated to the National Military Family Association

543
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Which supports families of all ranks and services including those of the developed deployed developed

544
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Deployed, wounded, and fallen

545
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So at this point, I really don't, I don't think the strategy that has laid out in this book is feasible at all

546
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I think there is a severe lack of knowledge of what is really going on between these two factions in the country

547
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And in the south, there's all kinds of, you know, there's like 13 different provinces

548
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And this stuff, it's very, it's tribal, you know, these shakes, these shakes

549
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
You know, it's like tribes and their families and they're related

550
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And it's all intertwined and it's very complicated

551
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
To kind of traverse that type of system coming from, you know, a whole different culture

552
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I just don't know if it's possible

553
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So I, I do think that sending more troops in for a defined, clear and hold strategy will fail

554
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Because there's no way I see a leader emerging

555
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It would probably be, and this is not a very nice strategy

556
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
But it may be the only one that could, in long term, save a lot of lives

557
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Is to select one guy

558
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Maybe two of them who get along together different ends of the country

559
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Have you seen a bigger rock is, is that big ass country

560
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You know, we've got to get some guys and we've got to turn them into the interleaders

561
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And that means supporting them, support this is what happens all the time

562
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And this time we didn't do, it's, that's the big mistake here

563
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It was an arrogant fucking mistake to think that you can pull a, uh, a tyrant, a dictator out of power

564
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And then everything just falls into place and everyone is jumping up and down

565
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
That shows the true, um, ignorance

566
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Of our United States administration and then that of the UK as well

567
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Anyone who joined in wasn't thinking at all about what is actually going on inside the country

568
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Remember all it was, there was talk about the courage, there was about the courage, there was about the courage

569
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I didn't hear about Sunni's and she isn't till I actually went there

570
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And now of course we talk about it all the time

571
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So it's a little bit more than just the courage, there's a lot of shit going on

572
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Read this book, seriously, read it, I think you'll enjoy it because it'll give you insight into something

573
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Um, that we'll go down in history is one of the biggest mistakes

574
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Not so much the invasion

575
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Uh, but pulling Saddam's and who's saying out of power

576
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Without a clear strategy in place as to who was going to fill that void

577
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And if it was going to be filled by a hundred thousand American troops

578
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Big astrategic mistake

579
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I'd love to hear from you all you have to do is calling to the voicemail numbers

580
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I'm going to give you the UK number first

581
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Plus four four two oh seven six eight one three seven five three

582
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Plus four four two oh seven six eight one three seven five three

583
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And I got a couple calls from Charles the joint London

584
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
My message was funny early before I finish my my thing

585
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Hi, this is Charles your joint London

586
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I am I'm a fan of feed up and never any fan of mine

587
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I have the question about what the hell face vanilla was

588
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I know what to know what's an English muffin I'm English I'm not sure what an English muffin is

589
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Is it what I would think a muffin is or I thought he called back with that biscuit

590
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Which is to me something company anyway young source of the rich

591
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So my wings and I think yeah, I think we got to do it now we're from our spine here

592
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It's the yanks versus the bits

593
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
We'll drive each other crazy, but everybody knows that it's apparent to see

594
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It's just like you and me it's the yanks and the bits

595
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
The yanks versus the bits

596
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Mind the gap. Yeah, it's so cool that you mentioned that man

597
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I can't I can't tell you that I can't tell you that it was so funny when we first got here

598
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I love English muffins. I really do and I was walking around Stainsbury's looking for English muffins

599
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Any autonomous is English muffins every American knows what those are like and of course if I just looked for muffins

600
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I would have gotten what I wanted now

601
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I didn't look for muffins because muffins if you want a muffin in the states is like a what do you it's almost like a cake here

602
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It's like a cupcake. I don't know it. No, you don't talk about cupcake

603
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Do you know cupcakes here in the UK, but anyway, muffins like a brand muffin or a you know a big ass dough bally thing

604
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And and muffins are indeed like English muffins

605
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Hmm

606
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
But the French vanilla thing we worked that out

607
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm our more saying Adam. I want to say happy Christmas or Merry Christmas. I happy new year

608
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Why is it you guys this is your first is the print again, sorry

609
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Why is it you you call it holidays

610
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You see if you're not Christian then then Merry Christmas isn't going to be offensive

611
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Surely like saying happy fanico

612
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Or what's it quantum the thing? I don't know American can't do it often with both quantum

613
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
They're asked a fair anything. I don't know really sure or um you know

614
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It's someone breaking their farms is the end of Ramadan

615
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I don't think I would be offended if they came to it. It's a happy Ramadan

616
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I spent last week and dressed as Santa along with about under 600 other standards

617
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Marching to London, charging and singing and getting drunk

618
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
There's a lot of fun. We said Merry Christmas to absolutely everybody

619
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Of all fates color be creed and yellow or actual

620
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Massive smile and a Merry Christmas to you too from everybody said it

621
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And there are people who are even dressed in in a mother's glasses on

622
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So and and you also you've just got to look into your Friday show

623
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
You've said Christmas about a time for coming home

624
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
So why would you call the holidays? You're going on holiday. You're not going home

625
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I don't understand a way vacation

626
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
That's just because it's me holidays

627
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You don't use word. Oh, anyway, bye

628
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You know what they say children and drunk people they always speak the truth

629
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Charles the drunk Londoner dude. I love it when you call in. Yeah, so indeed we call

630
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
What you would call a holidays here is what we call vacation

631
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I believe in the United States this whole holiday thing and I do it as well

632
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
It's a political correctness deal

633
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Because around the same time as Christmas you have Hanukkah

634
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And I think maybe it was I know I became aware of Kwanza maybe 15 years ago

635
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I'm sure Kwanza's been around for longer than that. I should look it up actually

636
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And they all kind of fallen in the same time frame and by the way

637
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I think the only holiday that consistently is on the 25th of you know is on a set date is Christmas

638
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So it's just easier to say happy holidays

639
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
You know, which means happy insert your religious holiday here to you

640
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
That's kind of where it came from

641
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,000
But on Christmas I say Merry Christmas and yet Christmas is a place is a time for coming home for the holidays

642
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Oh yeah, what a cluster fuck

643
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So I played the promo for the Jesus interview that is currently running with

644
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
What's the name of it's audio

645
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Fuck I don't remember Tom Pacifico's tell away

646
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And by the way it wasn't scripted I found out it was completely done

647
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You know off the cuff and I equate the the interview to

648
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Mel Brooks 2000 year old man a very very old skit and I have to

649
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I was pretty funny and I expected to get some response

650
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
To that show was certainly to me playing the promo with clips from it

651
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I got one but I do want to share it with you

652
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I don't know I it's for Nichols here

653
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I just bought that company

654
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
And as much as I like your show I absolutely hated

655
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:07,000
With a passion the promo with regard to the guys who are just really taking the risk that

656
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
There's Jesus Christ and I am a practicing Christian and I'm afraid very serious

657
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And I know I've heard the then put your bits and faces on my

658
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
You know my load for her all that business bits and places

659
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
But what you must understand I think is this when when you're a practicing Christian

660
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And I think Steve actually Steve might have been mentioned before

661
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,000
When you're when you're doing literally in love Christ because that's what being a Christian is a bad

662
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
It's a lifestyle choice

663
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's literally having somebody really seriously installed your wife or your kids

664
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Or something that you'd really daily love

665
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I apologize for about in here for a second

666
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I think there's insulting and I think there's making a joke and having fun

667
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
You know it's not like in this interview anyone says Jesus is is horrible

668
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
You know and by the way myself my wife my daughter have been insulted many many many many many many times

669
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
By many people who you even know

670
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
You know but you got to take it with a little bit of grain of a saw

671
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I think there's a lot of respect I think this total respect

672
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
But you got to be able to have some fun with it once in a while

673
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
You know just fun you can have fun about anybody and everything

674
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I don't think it was truly malicious

675
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I think it was just the creative exercise which I basically found it interesting

676
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And funny to hear what you know what would Jesus say if he was of these times

677
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And how would he speak

678
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I don't think it was meant as an insult

679
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Of course I respect your position but still don't equate it to people insulting my family

680
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Because they've been insulted a lot

681
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And I don't take it that seriously

682
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I don't accept that at all I've got to say

683
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And as much as people think how might be an idiot calling up

684
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Compligning you or not compiling

685
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
No no no dude you're not complaining

686
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I appreciate it. I ask people to call in about it

687
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You know I don't care because that's exactly how I feel

688
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And I'd like to put a message that you guys did do it

689
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
That's fine

690
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Just let's have a bit of equality

691
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Next one, what did you do?

692
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
One bad mechanic

693
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
The last of that, what did you do?

694
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
One of that bulldozer

695
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's always the questions we get in the net

696
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Well, because the Christians provide so much comedic value with their responses

697
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You know, we're told that we've got sick and suffering scars

698
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
We're not in the pandemic, the idiots

699
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You know, we're normal people

700
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
They've made a lifestyle choice

701
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Um, we've got people ready to live

702
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Well Paul, you know, I'll just say one thing

703
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I don't think I recall you calling in

704
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
When the Islamic community

705
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Worldwide was extremely pissed about a couple of cartoons

706
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
You know, so I don't and also don't think you can say it's only the Christians

707
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
If you compare it seriously

708
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
But I do have to say that Jesus Christ is definitely a much more enigmatic

709
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I can't even find the word

710
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Enigmatic

711
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
He's a much more, he's a better celebrity

712
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
He's just a much better looking celebrity than any of the other guys

713
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Completely making a mockery of homosexuality

714
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Or, you know, in a really violent way

715
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It's just as hurt for this not more

716
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
So I think you're going to get a lot of calls about it

717
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So that's under there we go

718
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Thanks very much, that's my opinion

719
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
See you

720
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Oh, and I mean what?

721
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Yeah

722
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Happy Christmas night

723
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Not happy holidays, happy Christ Christmas

724
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You're best night

725
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Happy Christmas to you

726
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
My friend

727
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Come on man

728
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It wasn't wild

729
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Did you listen to it?

730
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It wasn't all that bad

731
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Listen to it

732
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I mean listen to the whole thing

733
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And tell me you can't laugh at the irony of it

734
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It's just funny

735
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Anyway

736
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I appreciate your calling

737
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And you were literally the only collar I got

738
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I did not get an email or anything else

739
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Maybe after this I will

740
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Comic strip

741
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Comic strip

742
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Comic strip

743
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Comic strip

744
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Comic strip

745
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Comic strip

746
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Hi Adam Kerry, matey

747
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I wanted to say something

748
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Regarding this British motherfuckers

749
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Who criticized Potso

750
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Oy, Dweeps

751
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Get real

752
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Adam Kerry is in UK

753
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Not to suck your cocks

754
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
But just to give English spaking education to his daughter

755
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And to be close to family of his wife

756
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
That is in fucking Netherlands

757
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Oy, British motherfuckers

758
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
What do you think you are?

759
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You are nobody because only USA can't

760
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Example

761
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
George W. Bush

762
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Listen only to three entities

763
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Good almighty

764
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
His wife Laura

765
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And his dog

766
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Tony Blair

767
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
So shut the fuck up

768
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
British Dweeps

769
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And be thankful

770
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
That Adam Kerry leaves

771
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
From time to time

772
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
In your overly text

773
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Provinces of European Union Empire

774
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Anyway

775
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
This breeds and young

776
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Stick

777
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It's bullshit

778
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Because most US Americans

779
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I of non British origins

780
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Anyway

781
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Yeah

782
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I think I'm actually from Scotland

783
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Come extra blogger

784
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
One of your better ones

785
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You

786
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Hey, this is P-Dub

787
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And I just need to let you know about a couple of important things

788
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
First is about a contest

789
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I'm running

790
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Digital flats

791
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
My podcast

792
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
We'll be giving away to one lucky listener

793
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
If there is one

794
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And electoral voice

795
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Are E-20 microphone

796
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Now if you're not interested in owning

797
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
A microphone

798
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
You could turn around and sell it on eBay

799
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
For around $2,300

800
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
So this is a decent price

801
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Listen to digital plots

802
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Number 44 to find out how to win

803
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
The second thing is a bit of a pod show business

804
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Please tell Rosie for me

805
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
That I need a can of WD40

806
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
The satellite windows

807
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Getting a little sticky lately

808
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And it needs a loop

809
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Happy holidays

810
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
To all the curries

811
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
And all the DSC listeners

812
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Oh

813
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Oh and I always forget to say this

814
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I use a pressure washer

815
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Of course you do a P-Dub

816
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Then need some loop

817
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I think KY just signed up as a sponsor

818
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
For a number of shows

819
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
On what I've dubbed the erotic a channel

820
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
So we'll see if we can get some loop

821
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
P-Dub

822
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Hey, I was talking to P-Dub the other day

823
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And so the first two weeks of January

824
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Is going to be really really busy around here

825
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I need to help move house

826
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Which is the way they say it here in Britain

827
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
We're moving house

828
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And even though it's from the east side of Guilford to the west side of Guilford

829
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Dude, it's going to be a lot of work

830
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So I'm just really not going to have time to do a source code every day

831
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I need someone to fill in for duties

832
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
On serious because I do a lot of stuff every day for serious satellite as well

833
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So the first thing I'd like to get you guys thinking about is best of charles

834
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And preferably I'd like to make the perfect length for the satellite window

835
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Which is P-Dub was at 24 minutes

836
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I think we're 23, 30 or something like that

837
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I think it's 24, 30

838
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
So it would be ideal

839
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And I'm thinking about you know

840
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Compilations of good

841
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
You know episodes or things that you liked

842
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I need 10 of them

843
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
10

844
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
So there's a couple of ways to do it

845
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
But I think the easiest way is just to say

846
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Send in 10

847
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And the first 10 I get

848
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And they shouldn't be longer than 24 minutes in 30 seconds

849
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And we'll roll those out

850
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
You can put an intro on and an outro

851
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Whatever you want to do

852
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
To give yourself some credit obviously

853
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And we'll put those on the satellite

854
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
And we'll put it on the daily source code feed

855
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And then somehow I'm going to figure out who's going to be the host of the series shows for two weeks

856
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
That'll be fun

857
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
We'll make a contest out of it

858
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
To Adam Patricia and Christina

859
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
This is Steve Webb

860
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And I'm with the lovely lady Leon

861
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And two of my sons Steven and Timothy

862
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And we're wishing you and yours a very merry Christmas

863
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Fill with love, joy, and laughter

864
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
May this Christmas be blessed

865
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Beyond your wildest dreams

866
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And may you find the piece that Jesus came to bring on that first Christmas mourn

867
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Merry Christmas

868
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Ah, thanks guys

869
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Hey Adam it's Callie from Geek Brief TV

871
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And thank you so much for a great year

Merry Christmas

875
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
If you're going to watch a show today

00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Check out the new in the attic

877
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Which I think that just went up

878
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It's in the attic is Rachel Fuller

879
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Pete Townsend's girlfriend and Pete Townsend

880
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And it's brother and the whole crew

881
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And there with razor light

882
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Racer fish

883
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Racer light

884
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
On this particular episode

885
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Doing acoustic shit in the air stream trailer

886
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It's really good

887
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And what I like the most about this episode

888
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Is that it usually Rachel does

889
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
It kind of like a wide shot

890
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
So you can't really...

891
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
You see Rachel right

892
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
But it's not close up

893
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And it's much more close up this time

894
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
You got to see Rachel man

895
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And on the new in the attic

896
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
In the attic

897
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I'll show you how to cry

898
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
And melt the power

899
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Santa Claus is freaking me out

900
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I have a million questions

901
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Spimming around my hand

902
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Until I get some answers

903
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I'll refuse to give it to me

904
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Like how can a fat man

905
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Fim down my chimney

906
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Carrying all those presents for you

907
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And for you

908
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And for you

909
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
And for you

910
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And for you

911
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And for you

912
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And for you

913
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
And for you

914
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Do you think you can wake up

915
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
To the sound of all those whores

916
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Don't tell me most to cry

917
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And melt the power

918
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Santa Claus is freaking me out

919
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I have a million questions

920
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Spimming around my hand

921
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Since he lives out the North Pole

922
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I'm asking you instead

923
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Tell me how he does it all

924
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
In just one night

925
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Night

926
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Night ring dear

927
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
And just one slave does not sound right

928
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Maybe Santa travels in him

929
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
In hell

930
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
No

931
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,160
Festus lives

932
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,000
Painting why to blend in with the snow

933
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Don't tell me most to cry

934
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
And melt the power

935
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000

936
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000

937
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000

But somehow how the stuff ends up being

939
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
He liken as mystery

940
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000

941
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I'm filming for my milk and cookie brain

942
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000

Two fingers

948
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
