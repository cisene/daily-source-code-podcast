00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,320
Mr. Curry, the pod father, forgive this intrusion on such a joyous occasion.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,040
We've come to ask for your blessing.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,760
My name is Ed, and I'm Carlos.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,760
And this is Ed.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,960
We are from a podcast we call the Starcast.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,440
We want to know that we have lived up to your example.

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,120
You boys come to ask my blessing and my daughter's wedding day.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,920
Well, these boys have honored me and my family with your good music.

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,400
You're an interesting bubble and no questions attitude towards what is asked of you.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,240
This honor is the pod father.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,040
In one day, I may come to ask a favor of you.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,040
No kiss the real.

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,040
Thank you father.

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,040
Thank you father.

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,040
Thank you father.

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,640
You were a little lower.

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,280
May your daughter's first child be a masculine child.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,080

16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped my ass.

Three minutes?

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,200
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,040
We don't need no sticking friends, man.

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,160
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

31
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,760
Ob whoa chestic his madam Curry.

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,840

Play the time, please.

36
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,720
Play the time.

37
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,360
Play the time.

38
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,720
Play the time.

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,960

40
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,520
Play the time.

41
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,600
Play the time.

42
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:52,760
Rajé.

43
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,800
Rajé, hey anger, teasing me.

44
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,800
Hey, I'll make it my mercy to the grave

45
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Take your dreams to you, catch the disease

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,800
The age in the most powerful space

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Love is so I need them, they look at me there

48
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Cloth is ever changing, hope is shining in my eyes

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah

50
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,800
And I will always still answer them

51
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,800
And I'll make it my last time to move them

52
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,800
And I will always clean and take you

53
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,800
But I wanna be to no date

54
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Love is so I need them, they look at me there

55
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Life is ever changing, hope is shining

56
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Love is only needed, they forget me there

57
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Life is ever changing, hope is shining in my eyes

58
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,800
I hope is shining in my eyes

59
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Life is ever changing, hope is shining in my eyes

60
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Life is ever changing, hope is shining in my eyes

61
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Life is ever changing, hope is shining in my eyes

62
00:03:52,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Life is ever changing, hope is shining in my eyes

63
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,800
There's all I need, and then go get me there

64
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,800
I'll be able to change, and hope is shining

65
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Love is all I need, and then go get me there

66
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Love is ever changing, hope is shining in my arms

67
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Love is all I need, hope is shining in my arms

68
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Love is all I need, hope is shining in my arms

69
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Love is all I need, hope is shining in my arms

70
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Oh yeah, that'll wake you, to fear of us

71
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Esperanza, coming to you from San Francisco, very sunny northern California

72
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,800
Hey everybody, how you doing is the daily source code today is Friday

73
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Man, I'm ready for the show, I'm ready to rumble

74
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Lots of positive music for you today, lots of feedback, all kinds of stuff that I've been saving up for the end of the week

75
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,800
And you know, I woke up this morning, actually I did normally I wake up before the alarm clock

76
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,800
So it went off at 6 o'clock and I'm like, hey, I'm really tired

77
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Why am I so tired? I went to bed at 10.30

78
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
I know why

79
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,800
I've been traveling a lot

80
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,800
You know, what did I, I arrived Monday, went straight to the office

81
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,800
And I've just been nonstop since then, I think I'm ready for the weekend

82
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
How about you?

83
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Some of you may be listening to this on your way home

84
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,800
If you're in the UK, you probably got it around five in the afternoon

85
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Some of you, and on the west coast, you're probably getting this early morning

86
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,800
I may be you're 11 o'clock meeting if you're on the east coast in the US

87
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
And if you're in Australia?

88
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,800
Well, how is Saturday?

89
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Hi, it's Friday

90
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
Hi, it's Friday

91
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,800
I know, I know

92
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,800
It is the Marco from the show

93
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Hello, hello

94
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Happy Friday, Charlie France

95
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,800
This is Ray from Holland with a little sucker update

96
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Because not only Holland is orange, the whole world is getting a little orange

97
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,800
And that's a lot better than the Greengrassi Marijuana colour

98
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,800
We're refining up to everywhere I come and I tell that I'm from the Netherlands

99
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,800
People always start to talk about the coffee shops

100
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Anyway, today at 1,800 hours European time in Stuttgart, Germany

101
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,800
The World Cup match Holland against Ivory Coast will kick off

102
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Actually, I'm not such a big sucker fan, but I really like to watch all the World Cup matches

103
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
As much as I can

104
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Tonight, our Dutch coach Marco from Buster

105
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,800
We'll start with the same 11 as last Sunday

106
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,800
That means that Rafa El van der Fart won't play

107
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,800
But, Wesley Snyder will be in the center of the field again

108
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,800
I hope Ruth van Nisleroy, show off a little more

109
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,800
And Aryan Robo will play with his 10 friends on the field

110
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Ivory Coast coach Henry Mitchell has a knife on his throat

111
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
They have to win this game

112
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,800
I think the World will beat more orange at the tonight

113
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,800
And I don't underestimate the gang, but they're going to be spent

114
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
By the Italian Big Swinging Dig

115
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,800
I'm sorry, tell, but the 11 girls from the States are not going to win the World Cup

116
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Anyway, hope you have a wonderful weekend

117
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
See you soon

118
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Bye bye

119
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
Hey Ray, I'm fighting words, man

120
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
What are you talking about?

121
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,800
The 11 girls from the States give me a break

122
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
I have a really good feeling about him

123
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,800
And tomorrow a couple of the enthusiasts from Pacho HQ

124
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,800
We're all getting together, we're going to watch that game

125
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
They have a shot, I know they do

126
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
And they just had to kind of get into the whole vibe

127
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,800
So funny that all this World Cup stuff is going on

128
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,800
For me, in my limited little world of podcasting

129
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,800
But there's a whole other championship going on as well

130
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Which is the NBA finals

131
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Basketball here in the States

132
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,800
And it's funny because I really didn't know about it

133
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,800
Until last night, Ron said, hey man, come on, come on, come on, my place will have dinner there

134
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Of course, we had to take cabs since the Trinity option was out

135
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Trinity is at the doctor, by the way

136
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,800
She'll be okay, today we get full diagnosis and cost structure

137
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,800
But I'm getting her fixed no matter what, I love my Trinity

138
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:29,800
If you're new to this show, Trinity is my french fry oil, burning Mercedes station wagon

139
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,800
300 turbo diesel from 1984 that dropped her transmission

140
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,800
So we actually watched the heat gain, heat against the Mavericks

141
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,800
Miami versus Dallas, it was a good game

142
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Finally, Miami actually played a really good game

143
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,800
It was alright, you know, it's funny because

144
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Once you, I don't know, this is kind of hard

145
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Something about soccer, you know, even though you get relatively low points

146
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,800
There's just, this seems to be so much less structure to the game

147
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,800
How things can happen and for some reason with basketball

148
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,800
It seems like it really is based a lot on the tech, you see

149
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
In soccer, you're not supposed to foul the guy

150
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,800
And of course, you know, they're always trying to do something

151
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,800
To knock someone down without getting a yellow or red card

152
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
When basketball, this filing thing is really important

153
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Because then you get your free throws

154
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,800
I don't know, for some reason, it just didn't quite hit me as I thought it would

155
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
I don't know, what is happening to me?

156
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
I'm turning into a European, gosh, dang it

157
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Like in that soccer stuff

158
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
Hey, voicemail numbers all weekend long

159
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
You may be listening to the show over the weekend

160
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Love to hear from you, we have two numbers in New Jersey

161
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,800
201-65-635-7

162
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,800
And I have a number in London, so whichever is cheaper for you to call

163
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,800
Feel free 020-768-1375-3

164
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,800
Some cool news yesterday, some pod show news

165
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,800
Podcast Ali is now featured on the new Nokia phones

166
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,800
They have some kind of podcatcher aggregator built in

167
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,800
And you can now search through

168
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,800
portions of the podcast Ali directory

169
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
And it will download stuff automatically

170
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
I posted it on curry.com

171
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,800
So it's definitely cool and pretty proud of that

172
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
It's all part of the evil master plan

173
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,800
As we unveil podshow plus and the podcast Ali

174
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Renette word my friends

175
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Adam, hi this is Charles

176
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
From London

177
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
Just had to ring you know, everything

178
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Two last Friday, so to 402

179
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Yep

180
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,800
On May, I have to say, London in the summer time

181
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
Yeah

182
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
Yeah

183
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
Well, you know, I'm saying, oh my god

184
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
You should sit in so close square

185
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
On a weekday

186
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Around about lunchtime

187
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
When all the secretary is coming out

188
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
All you can do is get it up

189
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Mumbling the top down

190
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Oh my god, it's fantastic

191
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
Hang on second

192
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
You shouldn't really put this on a

193
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
No talking about alcohol

194
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Anyway, I'm sorry

195
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Well I say, hello Adam

196
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Renette here

197
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
I can't get it

198
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
No wait, I am a vacuum

199
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,800
I can't get it

200
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
I can't get it

201
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Charles, I am a vacuum

202
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
I can't get it

203
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
I can't get it

204
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Okay, thank you

205
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
There you go, it's all one guy apparently

206
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
Oh man

207
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Yeah

208
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
I mean, please don't

209
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Don't think that we're opening up a London office

210
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
To do any business

211
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
We're just there for the boobies in the summertime

212
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Failure to comply radio

213
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Show where we make you laugh

214
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
Cry and touch you in that special way

215
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Or maybe just laugh

216
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
From conspiracy theories

217
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
To throwing Katie Holmes into a ghetto

218
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
This show has it all

219
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
We're random

220
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
We're retarded

221
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,800
And guess what?

222
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
We're politically incorrect

223
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
It's failure to comply radio

224
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Visit us at www.ftcradio.net

225
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
Hi

226
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
This is Caitlin Smith

227
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
And you're listening to the daily source code

228
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
With your benevolent host

229
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
The podfather himself

230
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
A guy with really great hair

231
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Adam Kirk

232
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
He's like it's so dizzy

233
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,800
But before

234
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,800
All the smoke I've been heard

235
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Life's for you

236
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Like many times before

237
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,800
It's difficult to see

238
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
The melodies

239
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Coffers

240
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Like you know

241
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,800
My struggle here for my friends

242
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
And you

243
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,800
Let's give me

244
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,800
Can you

245
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Can you

246
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Will you

247
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Can you

248
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:21,800
Like wind you've carried me to a better place

249
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,800
That I'm here, I understand it

250
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,800
My mind has hearts and love, I love that feeling

251
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,800
When you rest, let's be awake now, you're sleeping

252
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:54,800
My mind has hearts and love, I love that feeling

253
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:03,800
When you're sleeping, I love that feeling

254
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:14,800
When you sleep, you're well, you're well

255
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:22,800
When you're well, you're well, I love that feeling

256
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,800
When you're well, I love that feeling

257
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:35,800
When you're well, you're well, you're well, you're well, I love that feeling

258
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Caitlyn Smith, from the pod save music network

259
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Here me, let me just check out her bio for a second here

260
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
Something magical happens, I read from the bio

261
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
When she grabs a guitar and steps up to the microphone

262
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,800
Coffee shops become silence, loud band, loving teens, turn quiet

263
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,800
It's all turned an ear to the obvious gift and embrace all that this artist has to give

264
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
It may be your confidence or the heartfelt expression of her music

265
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
It's Caitlyn Smith, from Minnesota

266
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Cool, like it

267
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,800
Oh, this is kind of cool, her influences, jewel

268
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Nicole Nordman and then this is cool, Beth Thorne Lee and the Bitties

269
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
Excellent, very, very cool

270
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
So pod save music, artists influencing her, I like that very much

271
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,800
And people ask me all the time, how may I, how can we get our song played on the daily source code?

272
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,800
Well, really easy one, I have to like the song, it's just that's sorry, it's my show, I don't care

273
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
I have to like the song, and I like a wide range of stuff

274
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:39,800
Two, it always does help when the artist cuts a promo and this was even pre-mix

275
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,800
It came to me in all one pre-mix form, and of course, at the end of the day

276
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Make it pictures also help

277
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,800
I had him, this is at Hagen from the editing.com photo cast

278
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Just listening to episode 404 and you play the comment about the guy from the Eurostar

279
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:05,800
Excuse me, and then licensing pod save music for their commercial podcast that they are producing

280
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,800
And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about where does the line get drawn for a commercial podcast

281
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:18,800
And we have a lot of podcasters out there that are looking at or have already quit their day jobs

282
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,800
And they are collecting income from their podcas

283
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,800
And some of them do play pod save music

284
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:34,800
So what is the definition of commercial podcast, I'm sure it's in the license

285
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,800
But in the terms of agreeing to it, but you know, it's a computer guy

286
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,800
I'm trying to just click except on the terms of whatever software I'm looking at

287
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,800
Can you talk a little bit about that and thanks a lot

288
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,800
And if you're a photographer out there, check out Editing.com

289
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,800
Right on Ed, it's real simple actually, I'm glad you asked the question

290
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
It's about the distribution

291
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
So this is really for podcasters

292
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,800
If you make a podcast, which they call it a derivative work

293
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,800
Or whatever the legal term is that you click the way the minute you signed up

294
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,800
That's okay, and it can be commercial, I mean, witness the daily source code

295
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Totally a commercial show

296
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,800
GoDaddy.com, DSC3 upon checkout for your domain name for $6.95

297
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,800
But if you were to burn this to a CD and distribute it to clients for a fee

298
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,800
Which is the case of the euro star

299
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Well, then you have to go and get permission

300
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Because now you're doing something else with it as that the license intends

301
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,800
And I think that's pretty much, you know, also commercial clients often

302
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,800
They want to compensate and I think that's kind of what was going on here

303
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,800
There was an agency working for the client for euro star

304
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,800
There's podcasts that were being developed they may or may not be if their internal podcast only

305
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Then the same thing would kick in because then it's

306
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
It's not a public work and you have to give all the attribution

307
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
So really it's about the distribution

308
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
But if you're just if you're quitting your day job if you're quit your day job

309
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
If you want to quit your day job you just want to make a show

310
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
And you're making money by doing your show

311
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,800
It's not a problem as long as you signed up to the podcast music and then that work

312
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
And of course you have to report back in

313
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
You just want to think about all the music, you know

314
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,800
I really do like playing all different types of tunes along Fridays

315
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,800
I do like to kick it a little bit

316
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Um

317
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Was it?

318
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
Have you ever heard that in over your head

319
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
Julian Smith

320
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,800
So he's noticed that I've been picking up on some R&B and hip-hop stuff

321
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,800
And I think I saw on his one of his show notes

322
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,800
That he was happy that I was coming out of the closet

323
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:41,800
As a closet as a closet dancer a closet hip hopper R&B you're not alone, Julian

324
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,800
Hey Adam this is Jeff Hines

325
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Right in that dance party podcast

326
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,800
And I'm glad you're finally coming out of the closet

327
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,800
Forget all that head bangers ball full shit

328
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,800
And who cares about a mallet

329
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,800
I mean does anyone look good to mallet?

330
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,800
I know I don't you look good to mallet Adam

331
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,800
So it's all about dance and it's all about shaking your ass

332
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Adam, what kind of ass do you have?

333
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,800
Is it round? Is it square? Is it fat? Is it thin?

334
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
Is it loose? Is it tight?

335
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
You know you like to get it like that

336
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,800
So I'm glad to see that you're finally playing some dance music on the

337
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,800
ESC that people can shake it and make it to

338
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
And that's what it's all about

339
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,800
So this is Jeff Hines with a Friday dance party

340
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,800
And all I have to say is keep on dancing

341
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,800
What to come over here and see what kind of ass I have man

342
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
If you're that interested

343
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,800
So it's Friday normally I'd be doing pod save the queen with Christina

344
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,800
It's time for episode number three of course I'm not home

345
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,800
And she is or I mean our other home as it were

346
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,800
She really wants to do the show and of course I want her to do the show as well

347
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,800
And I am I guess I'm the producer

348
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,800
So we have figured something out

349
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Hopefully but it won't be today because

350
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,800
It's just all the time zone stuff because what time is it now

351
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,800
It's already deep into the afternoon

352
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,800
And I have to get off to the office after I'm done with the with the

353
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,800
So it'll be over the weekend but we're going to try and do it via Skype

354
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,800
She's going to email me the songs and I think with the new Skype

355
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
The PC version at least

356
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
As you know, I'm still on windows

357
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
And she has windows as well

358
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,800
I think the sound quality just might be good enough to actually pull it all together

359
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
And pull off a pod save the queen

360
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
I can't wait to hear what she has lined up for

361
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Obviously

362
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Madam A, Moose Lawrenceville, California

363
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
Sorry to hear about Trinity's transmission

364
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,800
But hearing Christina's podcast

365
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Which I really enjoyed

366
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,800
The thing that comes to mind is for the last

367
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,800
No longest time that I can remember

368
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,800
You've been kind of complaining about not having a producer

369
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,800
And well long behold

370
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
You're a producer for your daughter

371
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,800
And you're doing a great job and so she so

372
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Cheers

373
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
Peace

374
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,800
Hi Adam, this is Chris and take us down there

375
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
I like to hear you play straight

376
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,800
But I think you guys are going to get some close going on

377
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
Thanks

378
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
Bye

379
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
Wow

380
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Your wish to my command

381
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
You'll be music heavy

382
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
Straight on the Charlie

383
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
I have described

384
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Nothing but black

385
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
And I'm afraid

386
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
Still I am dying to tell you

387
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
Crane

388
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
Into the room

389
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
Make a mistake

390
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,800
Let's see just how much it hurts you

391
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
I'd like to crack

392
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
I can't be alone

393
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,800
Always a pack

394
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,800
And they're just itching to bite

395
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Crack

396
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
I can't be alone

397
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Always a pack

398
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,800
And they're just itching to bite

399
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Down

400
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,800
Show me the way to the perfect

401
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,800
I work as a bomb

402
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
I find seen my reach

403
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,800
I want to love my myself home

404
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,800
Show me the way to the perfect

405
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,800
I work as a bomb

406
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
I want to love my head

407
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
To get me asleep

408
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,800
So I like to tell me how long you're

409
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,800
From the snake

410
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,800
To get me asleep

411
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,800
So I like to tell me how long you're

412
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
From the snake

413
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,800
To get me alone

414
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
Always a pack

415
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,800
And they're just itching to bite

416
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
Crane

417
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Nothing but black

418
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
And I'm afraid

419
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,800
Still I am dying to tell you

420
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Crane will work as a bomb

421
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,800
And will work as a bomb

422
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,800
Crane will work as a bomb

423
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,800
The soup born throne

424
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
Straight

425
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Those of you listening to us on serious stars

426
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
One, two, the satellite window

427
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
Is a close and PCH's next

428
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
And I will see you guys back here on Monday

429
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,800
So what's code listeners we continue now on the show

430
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
Tagged am it

431
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Almost had a perfect lead back time

432
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
I don't know what went wrong

433
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,800
I'm using the new version of Cast Blaster by the way

434
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Which is kind of cool

435
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,800
Cast Blaster Mike heard me talking yesterday about

436
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,800
ID3 tags and not being able to see those in Cast Blaster

437
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,800
So he turned around last night or whatever

438
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
And made me a new version

439
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,800
It's like great

440
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,800
So when I mouse over

441
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
And so if I mouse over

442
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Scrape let me see

443
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Almost second

444
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Of course not all songs have ID3 tags

445
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
And yeah

446
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
Okay there we go

447
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Some of them are working

448
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Although I would notice one thing

449
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,800
For some reason my F1

450
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,800
Which is my AC to the future

451
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,800
If I hit that it doesn't do anything

452
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
All the other F commands

453
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Start stuff like the thing out of the slide

454
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
And then I've got

455
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
Running walls

456
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
And I've got the Metro moment

457
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
But when I hit F1 it doesn't happen

458
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,800
So I don't know if that's a changing Cast Blaster Mike

459
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Or if that's something that's changed on my machine

460
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Subborn throne of course by request

461
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
New Hampshire's fastest rising band

462
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
Formed in the sea coast area by

463
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
Brothers Kobe and Kerry Dodd

464
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Who added bases Adam Hor and percussionist Travis Barton

465
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,800
The band has performed throughout the northeast

466
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,800
An open for such acts as Vince Wellnick

467
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Of the grateful dead and Todd Rungren

468
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
And Gary Hoey

469
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
He, Gary Hoey is playing tonight everybody

470
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
All right

471
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
I still have one more

472
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
So I got so many cool things I want to share with you

473
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
Oh yes today

474
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,800
K2 Kevin ready asked about Snake Bite

475
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,800
Which is the mixture of cider and ale

476
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,800
I guess in the UK which he thought was outlawed

477
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,800
And he really had a legitimate question

478
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,800
So he asked that by calling to the voice mail numbers

479
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
And of course we have an answer already

480
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
Hello Adam

481
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Mike Turner here from Bristol England County working in Chelm

482
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Also known as Gimm in Decito on Second Life

483
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,800
There are comments on Snake Bite I Charlie 404

484
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,800
Snake Bite is actually perfectly legal in England

485
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:59,800
Although some pubs won't actually serve it

486
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,800
Because apparently it doesn't make people a lot more pissed

487
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
A lot quicker

488
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
I don't think it does actually be a thing

489
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
It's just another legend

490
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
Anyway what you say is beer

491
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,800
We brits actually call ale or bitter

492
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
Now

493
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
To make a snake bite

494
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
Cider is normally mixed with larga

495
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,800
What called larga which would be both liser

496
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
Fosters or Croninburg

497
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,800
Some it like that which is the under beer

498
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,800
You would never mix cider with ale

499
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Or bitter

500
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,800
Also that other bloke I'm going to choose the show

501
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
The one who will criticise and you'll show

502
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Your sound and how to run it

503
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,800
I think he's an asshole

504
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
And I agree with you

505
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
I mean who would tell Gimm the end

506
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
It's a guitar sounded distorted

507
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
And he should turn it

508
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Distortion off

509
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
Anyway

510
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Yes

511
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
Bye

512
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Alright man

513
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,800
Thank you

514
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
Okay so we've settled that

515
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
I think it's time for a sound seeing tour

516
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
Snake Bite in the UK

517
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,800
You know I still have not

518
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
Actually you have to have your own pub

519
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,800
I think it's kind of like the an unwritten law in the UK

520
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,800
And that's the pub where you're going

521
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
Hang out

522
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
I have not chosen one

523
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,800
And I really do need to do that

524
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,800
So perhaps a sound seeing tour

525
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Of a

526
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
And believe me lots of people have sent me pub rules

527
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
And you know when you're supposed to buy a drink

528
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,800
Or accept a drink

529
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
And how you're supposed to strike up a conversation

530
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,800
There is a several rule books on all this

531
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
How to do it properly

532
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,800
But it seems to me like it's time for a sound seeing tour

533
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
of Snake Bite

534
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
Maybe a Snake Bite or two

535
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,800
Interesting discussion going on over curry.com

536
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
As of turned on the comments again

537
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
Seems like the

538
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
Comic strip blogger and

539
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,800
Jacic watcher stuff is all calm down

540
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,800
And if it starts up again

541
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
I'm just deleting comments

542
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
I'm so sick and tired of that

543
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
Can we all just get along

544
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,800
But the comments now are about the earthlink ad challenge

545
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
That we've been running

546
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
And this is pretty cool because this is where you get to

547
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
Make the advertising

548
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
And of course just listening to all these

549
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
Different submissions is by definition advertising

550
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,800
But I look at it as content for the show

551
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
And so there's people saying

552
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
Oh, you know this one sucks and that was no good

553
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
It's just like mainstream radio

554
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,800
But the whole point of this is

555
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,800
Then why don't you just send in your own submissions

556
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
So you should tell us how it's supposed to go

557
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
How it's supposed to work?

558
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
What will work?

559
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
AdChallence.podshow.com

560
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
I got another submission for you today

561
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
They are getting very good

562
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
I think we're seeing like 20 new ones a day come in

563
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,800
And this is for valuable cash prizes

564
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
$2,000 in prize money

565
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,800
We're doing the earthly clues

566
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
That's right baby

567
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Earthlink

568
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,800
Bombastic broadband

569
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Delicious dad

570
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
That's Earthlink

571
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
Ethnic comes home to you

572
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
And brings it home to mama

573
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,800
That's our assistant

574
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
That's what I'm talking about

575
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,800
In Earthlink

576
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,800
We'll help you out with all your internet needs

577
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,800
So just go to Earthlink.com

578
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,800
Let them know that pop a section

579
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,800
Yeah, that's your favorite

580
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
That's what I'm talking about

581
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
All right

582
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,800
So this week and I guess I'm going to go look for a table

583
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,800
And some other solution for the studio

584
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
Because it's really gotten bad now

585
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,800
I should take a picture of this

586
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
You know what?

587
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
Hold on a second

588
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,800
So I've got everything I'm running everything off of

589
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
The Tashiba laptop show notes

590
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,800
Run down my playlist for music

591
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
Cast Blaster

592
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
But as you know

593
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
I've told you about this

594
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
It's all in the kitchen

595
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
That's where it's all set up

596
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,800
And it's just way too low for me

597
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
So I have a roller bag

598
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Which you know when you roll on

599
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Take the airplane you can put in the overhead bin

600
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,800
And so the laptops on top of that

601
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,800
Now the microphone

602
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
I only have a really small stand

603
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,800
A portable stand with heavy foot

604
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,800
And I just snapped the high LPR 40 in there

605
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,800
But since it's so low

606
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,800
I've taken a candlestick

607
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
And let me take a picture of this

608
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,800
You won't believe it unless I tell you

609
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
Hold on

610
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,800
Let's see if I can get the whole thing in the shot here

611
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
There we go

612
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,800
Oh, wait

613
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
I want to get the microphone

614
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
This is not easy

615
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,800
Getting the whole whole thing in the shot

616
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,800
There we go

617
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,800
Do we take the picture?

618
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,800
Let's try one more

619
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,800
Just move this picture

620
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,800
There we go

621
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
I think we'll get a kick out of that

622
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,800
I'll post that in the show notes somewhere

623
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
Link to a flicker page

624
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,800
Okay

625
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
I had one more song lined up

626
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
I know I know I want to play it

627
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
Because I really like it

628
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
What is this

629
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,800
Antonio Bastian from Spain

630
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
Let me see lead singer in

631
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,800
Frogmouth, Labuelet, Muff

632
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,800
And Bastolich duo

633
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,800
Antonine, Antonine

634
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
Antonine, Antonine

635
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800
Antonine, Antonine

636
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
Antonine, Bastian's

637
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,800
Bastian's voice

638
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,800
Harmonica

639
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,800
Are his signature

640
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,800
Currently working on his label

641
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,800
And first solo album

642
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,800
New site coming soon

643
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Excellent

644
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
Link to all that goodness in the show notes

645
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
Let's check out Don't Break it

646
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
I think you will enjoy it

647
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
Oh, I remember

648
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
Georgie Todd sent me this one

649
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
Yes, funny

650
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,800
You don't need to be on the radio

651
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,800
My friend

652
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,800
Stick with us podcasters

653
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
What must I do?

654
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
To get on the radio

655
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,800
I'll message it up

656
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,800
But I know to the low

657
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
What's on my place

658
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,800
But I can dance

659
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,800
Please, Mr. Radio

660
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
Give me a chance

661
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,800
What must I do?

662
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
To get on the radio

663
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
I'll message it up

664
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
But I know to the low

665
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,800
What's on my place

666
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,800
But I can dance

667
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,800
Please, Mr. Radio

668
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Give me a chance

669
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
I don't care about the fame

670
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
And glory

671
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
Just pay my song on the radio

672
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,800
I don't need much never

673
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
I don't worry

674
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,800
I don't have a Rolex or a Casillo

675
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
Give me a chance

676
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,800
Let the public decide

677
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
Give my video on prime time

678
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,800
I don't have a thing behind

679
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Just want my chance

680
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,800
Is it the crime

681
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,800
What must I do?

682
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
To get on the radio

683
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,800
I'll message it up

684
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,800
But I know to the low

685
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
What's on my place

686
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,800
But I can dance

687
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
Please, Mr. Radio

688
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
Give me a chance

689
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
What must I do?

690
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
To get on the radio

691
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
I'll message it up

692
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,640
I know you're the Lord, want you on my page, but I can dance

693
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,440
Please, Mr. Radio, give me a chance

694
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,840
Three or four plays in the day

695
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,800
I'm not asking for the moon

696
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,440
In review me, I got things to say

697
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,160
A brand new LP, come and soon

698
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,640
If you're septic and you're critic

699
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,440
Don't take my music in the first degree

700
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,000
If my music gives you static

701
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,720
If it's my soul, don't you agree

702
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,440
What must I do to get on the radio?

703
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,640
I'll message it up, but I know you're the Lord, want you on my page, but I can dance

704
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,360
Please, Mr. Radio, give me a chance

705
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,080
What must I do to get on the radio?

706
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,280
I'll message it up, but I know you're the Lord, want you on my page, but I can dance

707
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,080
Please, Mr. Radio, give me a chance

708
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,720
Like a pit bull I will never let go

709
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,440
One of the critics come to my show

710
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,080
All publicity is good publicity

711
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,800
There a opinion will never harm me

712
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,520
I will always do my thing

713
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,080
Leave my heart and sing

714
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,720
If you don't like it, don't buy it

715
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,440
If you don't buy it, don't break it

716
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,080
What must I do to get on the radio?

717
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:35,280
I'll message it up, but I know you're the Lord, want you on my page, but I can dance

718
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,080
Please, Mr. Radio, give me a chance

719
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,800
