1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Delta Shara Charli, 3-1, 9.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,000
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Transmiddles?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We don't need no sticky and crispy.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh, fantastic! It's a battle curry.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I gotta tell you, I really despise it when I'm just late to rise,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but need a little bit of sleep.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So, daily source code is on the late side today.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Coming to you from a very sunny Northern California from the Curry condo.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let me get some coffee and everybody.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sad, jealous to me.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I love his wonders, and all the trips we have to take.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Where's the scrollfinder?

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We have to take.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Where's scrollfinder?

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We know these stars the way.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We saw a light stay straight through the day.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We're on a side.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We come and go and never let it.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You know it's time.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
As for holidays, we'll dream about them.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And those will shine.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We know these stars the way.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We saw a light stay straight through the day.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We know these stars the way.

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We saw a light stay straight through the day.

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We say through the day.

30
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We go and let it go and let it go.

31
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay, that would be haunting, I guess.

32
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's how I could just envision a rolling stone magazine critic categorizing that song.

33
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Thank you so much.

34
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I like it a lot actually.

35
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I like it more than the blur track.

36
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I like it a lot.

37
00:05:49,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The first time I was able to demo the whole system or at least what we have of the system that's working now for the podcasters but more importantly for listeners that's really the stuff that I'm so incredibly excited about what we've put together.

38
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I think I can't remember when I actually had dinner at a dinner time.

39
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
This thing is so easy, I could actually do my nails while producing the entire show, it's so fine.

40
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We'll talk a bit about some feedback you guys sent me regarding using cast blaster and yesterday's sound.

41
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Something else I tested yesterday and demoed which I'm just so happy about because it's working is purchasing music on the podsafe music network.

42
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And I think that we are just about ready to open this up and see what everybody thinks and see how it works and get some feedback from well from you guys the listeners.

43
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah, some people like this.

44
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm the DSC and you're talking about pricing for music on the PMN when you get your credit card system up and running for the public.

45
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Personally myself, I think 99 cents for a free and clear MP3 is an excellent value and I would pay that for almost any song on the PMN right now.

46
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And I would buy their music at the drop if I had free and clear.

47
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Let's keep up the good work out. I'll be one of your first cast version when you get that up and run and thanks a lot.

48
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Right on my brother.

49
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Okay, so here's the steps we've got to take. So first of all, for those of you who don't know or maybe you're just tuning in or never listen to the source code or maybe you're listening on.

50
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And serious satellite stars 103, pod safe music is a concept that brings together podcasters and independent artists or basically any artists who owns their own material and the copyrights and hasn't.

51
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Given them well, I don't think anyone gives them way or as a sold them to a to a record company or traded them in some fashion.

52
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And it's really simple, you know, when you sign up when you register at the pod safe music network artists agree that podcasters who are also registered it's a very simple licensing term which is essentially agreed to when you sign up you can read all the terms online.

53
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:25,000
When when you sign up podcasters can use your music download it use it in their podcast as long as they report it back into the network.

54
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's really simple so it's a great promotional tool.

55
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The concept has been to actually turn on sales so that anyone because we get so much feedback from listeners who really want to get a hold of these tracks they want to buy CDs.

56
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
They it's a lot of the pod safe music artists by the way are also available on iTunes.

57
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So the concept is is to make available individual tracks for sale on through the pod safe music network.

58
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Through a one click actually is what we've been implementing and I really wanted to be the things I like about the iTunes music store is that they have my credit card.

59
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So whenever I want something I just go in just click buy it's all you know I'm already logged in so I don't have to pull out a credit card ever again for you know for this relatively small purchase of 99 cents.

60
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So we want so we replicated that functionality which is logical I guess or any any store that you're going to visit a lot of it just makes so much sense if if we know who you are.

61
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And the the big thing here I think the big oh wow factors that we want to sell free and clear MP3s now we're ready to go the system is in place.

62
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I've already purchased two songs in a test you know testing obviously but actually did have to pull the credit card and actually did have to pay my 99 cents.

63
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Oh here's something that's very cool worldwide okay so there's no restrictions by market anywhere in the world and currently we're looking at just to get things going at the same pricing 99 cents.

64
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And what I'd like to do is okay let me just back up one second so this will obviously not be compulsory for all artists because particularly the artists that came in you know this is a new deal so we want to give people an option.

65
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The way it's going to work is if you're an artist and you've uploaded music to the pod save music network all you have to do is well when it's available it's not enabled yet all you'll have to do is just go into your account and any song that you want to make available for sale you just click a checkbox or I guess you'll be able to click one checkbox to make all your songs that you have uploaded.

66
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Available and of course that'll only work if we have all of your information because we need to be able to send you money makes sense doesn't it.

67
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And there's a whole whole bunch of other pieces that are going to be coming and strapped on to that as we move along but that's the start so what I want to do today isn't going to reach out to.

68
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:06,000
One or two artists I'm not going to tell you who now but I think you'll agree that it's the right choice for the test one or two artists.

69
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And going to ask them if it's okay if we test with their song just to make sure that everything works I'd like to have some global reports and global feedback I already tested my UK credit card and of course my US credit card and they both work fine but we wanted to work all over the world.

70
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So hopefully by tomorrow you will be able to participate in this test and now the test is going to cost you money if you actually purchase something will cost 99 cents but it will be great if we can if we can get the if we just make sure everything is working globally and then.

71
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I guess it'll be turn time to invite the artist to turn on the the sales mechanism for the individual track so.

72
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's going to be it's going to be pretty exciting.

73
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Let's see what else we got going on here a lot of response to to Rogers not necessarily Roger Smalls who sent me of course that wonderful.

74
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Did he the other day asking or actually wondering what I smell like but people like Devon of some dwarf said okay I just had to write you that Roger Smalls jingle is just fucking hilarious it was all like I do to keep swearing off the road this morning when I heard it.

75
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So we play it just one more time then yeah why not here we go.

76
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Jeff Smith man you too much okay I hope you didn't drive off the road we don't have anything from Roger although I did see that he posted a whole bunch of stuff on his weblog again about how I see it was a bit disappointed that I smell of.

77
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
What do you say Asian women hairs or something like that oh man it's too much.

78
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm going to do something it's here's what happened yesterday went to our board of directors meeting and.

79
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What's really cool is and you know some of these guys who are on our board.

80
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Control significant portions of the universe as far as I'm concerned you know they they're really involved in a lot of things and extremely well connected which is of course exactly why one of them is our investors.

81
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And just get rid of the tea here this is I need a microphone stand here because I'm always hunched over when I'm in in the condo.

82
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So so we show up for the board meeting I was like 10 o'clock or something and it's so cool when you get someone like a Ray Lane who basically ran Oracle corporation for a number of years.

83
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Really you know as a guy who's involved a lot of things extremely busy and you know I hadn't seen him for a while since the last board meeting couple a couple weeks and.

84
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And he says hey man where's Trinity.

85
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It makes me and you know and it's not a business thing is purely a creative thing when when someone turns around and basically you know is saying hey I listen.

86
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't just listen but I'm involved and I'm listening it was really it was nice.

87
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And of course we didn't take Trinity because no one would let Ron and I drive in the same car.

88
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:22,000
At least not that car for for fear for fear that she wouldn't make it by the way the brake light is not coming on anymore so I guess that was just a momentary momentary thing maybe because of the rain.

89
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But Ray also said that he hates it when I talk about my microphone he doesn't give a shit.

90
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And I'm sure a lot of you don't care about it but since I did ask yesterday specifically about the sound of cast blaster.

91
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And actually of course I record the show then I hit the button to make it go up to the to the podcast delivery network and you know so I didn't really so I already put it up and posted it before I actually heard what it sounded like and I heard some of the problems that you guys sent back.

92
00:14:49,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Michael Berg just a quick comment congrats on the new laptop and cast blaster set up I'm guessing you'll be very happy with that yeah I am actually quite happy I didn't notice one thing during Roger Smalls intro the volume was going noticeably up and down especially during that yeah.

93
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Don't know what could be causing it I think I found it because I had so essentially there's a way to set up cast blaster to use an external mixer and you disable the internal mixer but you're still kind of running everything through.

94
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The channel that is labeled microphone and there's a limiter that you can turn on or off and I had that on and I think that that really just you know because it wasn't just my voice going through it was everything the music the whole deal.

95
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So I think that's probably what would messed up the sound annoying is the title of this one from Chestnut Bay podcast Bob Robinson somewhere in Vermont cast blaster pumping.

96
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
During your really annoying Roger Smalls jingle oh come on it's not annoying.

97
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,000
There was definitely some pumping of the audio system when the jingle played the audio levels cycled several times so annoying or not it's a great test case.

98
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,000
See if you can isolate it to cast blaster not pretty sure it was cast blaster we're going to wait we know we're going to try this in a second so I got one more pumping here from.

99
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Was it Mike Scott.

100
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Yep just listen to three 18 yep the limiter is pumping especially on the music drop in your smart to use an external board and compressor limiter.

101
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's easier to avoid pumping digitally okay so I think that that was the problem let's just do this Roger Smalls thing one more time just to make sure that it's not anything other than.

102
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Roger ready.

103
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's another message from Roger Smalls.

104
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Roger Smalls.

105
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Man.

106
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Joes.

107
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Man.

108
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Joes.

109
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Man.

110
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Joes.

111
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Man.

112
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Joes.

113
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Man.

114
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's.

115
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Man.

116
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Joes.

117
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Man.

118
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Man.

119
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Joes.

120
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Man.

121
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Man.

122
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah.

123
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So I'll have you know that yesterday I I presented all of our ways to our board of directors in my Metro sexual outfit.

124
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I was so proud, I had my black Dolchukabana pants on, and my ugly boots, my black ugly boots.

125
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And I was wearing a pink sweater, it was fantastic. I could see him all looking.

126
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
That hell was out of where? Where's the suit in the tie that we're supposed to have when we do board meetings?

127
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Anyway, so that was my minor metro sexual moment for yesterday.

128
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
A couple of things for today. Let me see Leo Vagoda sends in.

129
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Do you let in the UK have a promotion going? We can get a free mock three razor.

130
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And you actually post a link to it. Who can argue with free?

131
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Absolutely.

132
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What does that say? He posts his own site.

133
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Leo Vagoda, toothpaste.bind.org.

134
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Wow, okay.

135
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So, looks like the, the Gillette folks are gearing up in the UK.

136
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Hey, it's not like we wouldn't take any free razors over here for registered listeners of the source code.

137
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You know, we're raising our hands.

138
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Giles says, as a follow to my previous email on the mock three and it's alternative use that my wife and I found.

139
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I have a more conventional shaving tip.

140
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Basically, you should always try and wait 30 minutes after waking up before shaving.

141
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
This gives the skin time to recover its normal level of topness.

142
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
After having been relaxed overnight, thereby hopefully helping to reduce cuts and providing a closer shave.

143
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That's pretty, that's actually a good tip.

144
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I mean, there's a couple of the, I think the first thing you really should do in the morning when you wake up is probably splash cold water on your face.

145
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And then before you get ready to shave, then you kind of warm it up with a nice relaxing bit of warm water.

146
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Giles goes on to say, I was also wondering if Roger Smalls has got any mail grooming tips that he could pass on.

147
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm sure that if he has any, there would be of interest to many.

148
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Now, that's a good idea.

149
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Let's see if we can get Roger into the Metro sexual moment.

150
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I somehow agree with you, Giles.

151
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I think he probably does have some interesting tips that we would enjoy.

152
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Quick note from Steve Harlow about stubble.

153
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
The way to do it is to not shave, but to use barber clippers.

154
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Wall, that's Whiskey Alpha Hotel Lima, are the best.

155
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The small salon type.

156
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Use them like Swadeheads, use them on their heads. Swadeheads.

157
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What the hell is a Swade? Is that someone who's bald? Is that what you call all across a Swadehead?

158
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Experiment with the settings to get stubble long enough to be soft, so the girlfriend is tickled, not abraded.

159
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
But sure enough, to not be a beard.

160
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I did this throughout the 90s until my whiskers turned gray and the look became less sexy and more like mold.

161
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm back to shaving again.

162
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm the one who used the single blade at big for 10, for a year.

163
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I also use regular bath soap and lather up with my hands.

164
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That makes me more caveman, but I can watch more figure skating and scrub my own toilets.

165
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So maybe I'm not a complete jerk. Steve Harlow.

166
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Thank you very much.

167
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I've actually gotten some calls from people who have admitted that they too are, well, they're completely into the skating championships.

168
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And it's even worse, yesterday I watched skating with celebrities.

169
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Okay, and I don't know if I feel good about that at all.

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Hey Adam, this is Nick Carver from the Wildle Fritz, jazz guitar podcast.

178
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You know, so often at the end of the work day, I've got so many committee meetings.

179
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I've got internal problems and I've got clients calling me and I'm thinking if only I could quit my day job.

180
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Well, hey, I'm glad to be joining the pod shown network and who knows.

181
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Maybe I'll be able to quit my day job.

182
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
But for now, I'm just going to keep broadcasting great jazz guitar music.

183
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
That's no little frets.

184
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The jazz guitar podcast at podshow.com.

185
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Right on my welcome Nick.

186
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
No, I don't fret spotcast.

187
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
New member of the podshow podcast network fantastic.

188
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Look forward to hearing how you do with cast blaster.

189
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Got a note from cast blaster Mike, by the way.

190
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
He was often the wood somewhere programming stuff.

191
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
He had to get away, you know.

192
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That's developers like to do that.

193
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I like to do that shit.

194
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You know, just get away and have total silence and be one with nature in your laptop.

195
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I got this email for to to me from who's it's from Shayna.

196
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
The email from from sharedmarryk.com.

197
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Interesting.

198
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And it's one of these lists, which I thought was pretty funny.

199
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It's 15 things to do at a Walmart while your spouse or partner is taking their sweet time.

200
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And so there's list of 15 things, which I think are pretty funny.

201
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
They would be even funnier if someone actually recorded doing these any one of these 15 things at Walmart.

202
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And shit, if you send me any one of these, will you actually do it like a sound seeing tour set up.

203
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'll send you a t-shirt.

204
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
So let's just run down the list.

205
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Get 24 boxes of condoms and randomly put them in people's cards when they aren't looking.

206
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Okay, that won't work with sound.

207
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Set all the alarm clocks in housewares to go off at five minute intervals.

208
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That's a good one.

209
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Make a trail of tomato juice or should I say tomato juice on the floor leading to the rest rooms.

210
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Walk up to an employee and tell him or her in an office tone.

211
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Code three in housewares and see what happens.

212
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'll be a good one.

213
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Put a bag of M&Ms on layaway.

214
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Move a caution wet floor sign to a carpeted area.

215
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Set up a tent in the camping department.

216
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Tell other shoppers you'll invite them in if they bring pillows from the vetting department.

217
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Ask a when a clerk asks as they can help you begin to cry and ask,

218
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Why can't you people just leave me alone?

219
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Look right into a security camera.

220
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Use it as a mirror and pick your nose.

221
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
While handling guns in the hunting department.

222
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Ask the clerk if he knows where the antidepressants are.

223
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Dart around the store suspiciously while loudly humming the theme from mission impossible.

224
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
In the auto department practice your Madonna look using different size funnels.

225
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Hide a clothing rack and hide in a clothing rack.

226
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
This is a good one.

227
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
This is this would work great.

228
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Hide in a clothing rack.

229
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
When people browse through say pick me pick me.

230
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
When an announcement comes over the loudspeaker assume the fetal position and scream

231
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
No no it's those voices again.

232
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And last but not least.

233
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Going to a fitting room shut the door and wait a while and then yell loudly.

234
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Hey there's no toilet paper in here.

235
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So this was for oh here it is for to from Ask Shayna.

236
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Shayna is with a Y dot com.

237
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Okay I like the last one.

238
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
They did cross Chris Rockwell do another a daily download yet.

239
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Man he better.

240
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
He better hurry up.

241
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I didn't do my dump for nothing.

242
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Hey folks on the serious satellite Pacific Coast.

243
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Hellway is up next followed by a Madge Weinstein Dawn and Drew and all of the pod show.

244
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I'll talk to you guys tomorrow on our Friday.

245
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
It's running through the wrong speaker.

246
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I got to put that through the different sound card.

247
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Okay while it's just us here a couple things.

248
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Oh yeah I got several emails about going to Australia.

249
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Doug Mooney who I've known for a long time.

250
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Who actually in his own way was quite instrumental in getting pod casting on the map.

251
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
He wrote a great story about pod casting.

252
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I think before even slash dot caught on to it and certainly before the BBC showed up.

253
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
At the what is it?

254
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
What is he right for register dot com?

255
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I'll have to look that up.

256
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Anyway Doug Mooney I know from back in the digigic that digics days.

257
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Those are the guys who are hosting MTV dot com when I own the domain name.

258
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Let's see.

259
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I've been to Australia three times Sydney twice Melbourne once as Doug Karen's twice.

260
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Sydney is like San Francisco except this cheaper less hilly.

261
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
The people are more friendly and the food is most excellent.

262
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It's also more water oriented with one of the largest ferry services in the world.

263
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It's worth the trip especially if you can manage the depart rainy cold England in December to go down during the warm sunny beautiful season down under that's right because of course.

264
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Summer and winter are perpendicular to each other down under.

265
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Commence the family and he says shave closely first of course to take two weeks down under spend a couple days.

266
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Quote working and the rest of the time taking in the beauty of the country and the hospitality of the country if you want to be a real or entrepreneur.

267
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Maybe you could con submit a proposal to the Australian Ministry of Tourism to sponsor your trip and exchange for a daily podcast down under.

268
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Well first of all Doug I've been to Australia I've been there for for two weeks and and I do love it and I just want to go back and I want to meet some of these podcasting.

269
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Podcasts there seems like such as seen is going on and it is a beautiful country.

270
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I don't know if it's if Sydney's better than San Francisco I think they you know each one has stuff that it excels in.

271
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Michael Collins says business reasons to come to Australia.

272
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Hey Adam I heard on the Delta share Charlie three one eight you're looking for business reasons to come to Australia.

273
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Well if you come to Sydney I'd be happy to buy a Logitech MM 50 from you.

274
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Hell I'll even buy you a cup of coffee.

275
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
There you go two business transactions.

276
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm sure if you encourage us Australian listeners for some business you'll have enough business reasons to come to Australia in no time.

277
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
You know what you want to here's what I should do.

278
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I should figure out when when of one of our board of directors is taking their private airplanes that direction and hop on board that would be business to be to go talk business for 20 hours.

279
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
That's not those kinds of business reasons I need obviously but appreciate the thought.

280
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And one thing I just wanted to mention that was it really really surprised me.

281
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It was either yesterday or the day before I saw some news that was reported by.

282
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Let me see I have here from clicks dot com that's probably I don't know if that comes from news dot com where that's from but I know that I saw it on CBS market watch.

283
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And it was it you know there's there's announcements about podcasting advertising networks and people doing add insursions and aggregation and networks and there's stuff all the time.

284
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Which of course is good which means we are forming an industry but what surprised me is that pod track announced as reported by.

285
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:16,000
CBS market watch that let me see I want to I don't want to miss quoted here.

286
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So they basically announced some of the podcasts that they're working for and what they're doing.

287
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:31,000
They've signed hundreds of top rank podcasts where's the one I'm looking for this was.

288
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Oh man okay well while I'm looking for what I'm scanning this page to try and find exactly the exact wording what they said.

289
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Is hold on I don't want to miss quote this shoot where's this thing.

290
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Well maybe we should go back to CBS to marketwatch dot com to find it.

291
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Okay so anyway what they said is that they are holding an auction.

292
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So basically the advertisers are bidding in an auction for I guess the rate for a number of podcasts including.

293
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
To it.

294
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,000
This week in tech this week in technology which of course is the the extremely popular.

295
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Technology gab fest produced and hosted by Leola port and of course he has the tweet crew on there including John C. Dvorak.

296
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And here this it really caught my eye because I'm like.

297
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Leola port is like the number one.

298
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Well let me just say at his keynote at the portable media expo he said he would never ever take advertising.

299
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Yeah he has a deal with I think AOL or something for bandwidth but he said he would never take advertising.

300
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And here I'm reading that pod track is saying that they were actually holding an auction for advertisers.

301
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,000
To advertise on Twitter and I couldn't believe it so I fired off an email to Frank Barnico who.

302
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Who writes those who actually wrote that article for marketwatch I said dude you know how can this be true.

303
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It was pretty funny Frank said well I did ask the the PR lady twice like okay maybe you should ask Leo if it actually is taking place.

304
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
So he said he was going to get in touch with Leola port but.

305
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I have a hard time believing that if it's true then I think that that is bigger news the fact that Twitter is taking advertising than anything else.

306
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And and it's extremely exciting actually so.

307
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Let's let's find out anyway I haven't heard back if if Leo has said this is indeed happening or not and I apologize I just can't seem to find.

308
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
This one particular this one particular quote.

309
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
But if you go to marketwatch.com you'll be able to find oh here it is.

310
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Thank goodness it also launched an auction for three top podcasts including technology focused this week in technology and entertainment oriented muggle cast and Josh and Japan quote.

311
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Advertisers.

312
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And that's not the quote I wanted.

313
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Yeah this week pod track began selling ad space on individual podcast and it's network and across multiple podcasts in the category.

314
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Okay there it says this week in tech interesting interesting to see what comes out and what kind of what kind of advertisers are they going to be this is extremely exciting.

315
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
All righty let me see I got to get I got to get out of here. I got to get to the office where you got all kinds of stuff going on.

316
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Let me play another song from the pod safe music network all read this girl's bio to you after you hear it.

317
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
But it was basically another recommendation from a listeners.

318
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I was really keen to meet.

319
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I thought was right on the make the leave.

320
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Said he showed me how to breathe.

321
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Said he can't get up to sleep.

322
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Got no wakily from my sleep.

323
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Only I'm my soul to keep.

324
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
See the words been never speak.

325
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Make the strong but keep me awake.

326
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Want to touch the stars we go.

327
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
See the art show with this bone.

328
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Watch the lion flying free.

329
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And the scale that took from me.

330
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And he's got to take me here.

331
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
One of the stars they are going to use tonight.

332
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
There are no words to make it right.

333
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
But one has been to what has begun.

334
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Many business.

335
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I've been to these empty hopes of mine.

336
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I'll reach all the words between the lies.

337
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And draw some strength on what we've done.

338
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Then eat this setting sun.

339
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And I'll reach all the words between the lies.

340
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And I'll reach all the words between the lies.

341
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And I'll reach all the words between the lies.

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And I'll reach all the words between the lies.

343
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And I'll reach all the words between the lies.

344
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And I'll reach all the words between the lies.

345
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And I'll reach all the words between the lies.

346
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And I'll reach all the words between the lies.

347
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And I'll reach all the words between the lies.

348
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And I'll reach all the words between the lies.

349
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And I'll reach all the words between the lies.

350
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And I'll reach all the words between the lies.

351
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000

00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And then I'll reach all the words between the lies.

00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And I'll reach all the words between the lies.

00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And I'll reach all the words between the lies.

361
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And I'll reach all those words between the lies.

362
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And I'll reach all the words between the lies.

363
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And I'll reach all the words between the lies.

364
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And I'll reach all the words between the lies.

365
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And many of this setting sun

366
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I've been through these empty hopes of light

367
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'll reach your words between the lights

368
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And draw some strength on what we've done

369
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And many of this setting sun

370
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And many of this setting sun

371
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And many of this setting sun

372
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You said you'd walk with me again

373
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Like a brilliant voice, my turn

374
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Once sharp as anyone

375
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Now the scorpion has stuck

376
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I'm like a virgin all the time

377
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I don't think he's coming

378
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
What else do I say on these tonight

379
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
There are no words to make it right

380
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
But what has given to us has begun

381
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Many of this setting sun

382
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I've been through these empty hopes of light

383
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I'll reach your words between the lights

384
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And many of this setting sun

385
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
This is Shuman

386
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And the setting sun from the pod safe music network

387
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
A little bit of Laurie Anderson there at the end almost

388
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
As a former member of Dream

389
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
As it says on her bio on the PMN

390
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Melissa Honderscills, opening for the likes of Britney Spears

391
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
In sync, the backstreet boys

392
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
98 degrees in Destiny's Child

393
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Currently she's working on a new solo album

394
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Which she hopes to release independently in 2006

395
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Melissa, we look forward to your independently released music

396
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And we want to help you

397
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Just want to help you

398
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
And thanks to Brent Bradley who sent me the link to Melissa

399
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
On the pod safe music network

400
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
She said, great song and she's very hot

401
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Thanks

402
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
That always gets my attention

403
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Immediately clicked on it to see what was going on

404
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Alrighty

405
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Tomorrow we'll have the thank god it's Friday edition of the show

406
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
And then Saturday it's back home

407
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I can't wait to see the girls

408
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I really miss them

409
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And I think they kind of miss me too

410
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
They've hinted at it

411
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And it's going to be busy because I'm definitely going to have to go to Holland

412
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
In the next couple of weeks my mom isn't feeling too hot

413
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
She started with her chemo treatments

414
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And the first one hit her like a fucking atom bomb

415
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You know like three four days into it

416
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So she's actually a

417
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Admitted to the hospital because she couldn't eat

418
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And she was completely dehydrated

419
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
So my poor sister man

420
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
She's the only one of the siblings

421
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
That actually lives in the Netherlands still

422
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
She's taken the brunt of all the stuff

423
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And my dad is still a rehabilitation

424
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And the dog is sick and all that shit

425
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Anyway

426
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
We all got shit going on right

427
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
It's all what life is

428
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It's all that the stuff that life brings us

429
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And

430
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
But we'll be back tomorrow

431
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And we'll party

432
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
We'll just continue to party

433
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
You know?

434
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Because it's Friday

435
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
That's why

436
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Take care everybody

437
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Bye bye

438
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
