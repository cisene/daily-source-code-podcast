1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 3-4-4

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
When the sheriff found the plants

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
They were eight feet tall at least

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Growing in a grassy little urge of the highway

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
To the east

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Who owns this land

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The sheriff had to know

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
He said someone's got to pay the price

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
For letting these plants grow

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The land belonged to God himself

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The records clearly showed

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So God went on the one at least

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The crimes he and it got removed

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
God himself showed up in court

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The answer for his crimes

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The calling goes early in the past

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
He may have deserved some time

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Mother nature managing

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Whatever you do

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
To make the world so bright

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And we're a little wet all black on you

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The call went wrong again

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We're a little dry to your sleep

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
He's just in the eye

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The job is playing

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This call is the greatest

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
According to the accused

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We're a little wet

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
God said

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But you are crazy

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I send this as a gift

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
To ease your stress

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And worry little mind

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Just your spirit to sigh

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Would lift

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So you and it

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The judge is going

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
To committing such a crime

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So although I hate to do it

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You're gonna have to serve some time

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So that one got up in the federal pen

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
For his lifetime, no approval

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The words were passed to dust

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And the judge fears poor soul

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Now the law to his little tail

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
In case you couldn't tell

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't try to make it clear

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And if they can't sell it

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
There's a group so well

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Mother nature managing

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Whatever you do

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
To make the world so bright

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And we're a little wet all black on you

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The call went wrong again

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The legal drug loss

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He's just an eye

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The judge is playing this court

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The greedy kids

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
According to the accused

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
He's just an eye

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The judge is playing this court

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The judge is playing this court

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Shhhhh

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Mother nature of Merid Jane

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What have you done

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The Court of Breetingers

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Val Davis from the plainæƒ… es Nietzsche

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
object

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm music.podshow.com.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's Wednesday, halfway through the week back

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
at the cottage in Gilford, the affluent suburb of Surrey

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
in the United Kingdom.

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's a beautiful day today.

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It is very, very cold, but it's one of those days where

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
you can see for miles and miles and miles, the sun is shining.

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
There's a little bit of wind, which would actually be beautiful

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
for flying today.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Wouldn't it?

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I got to call the wind commander.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
See, when I can pick up the delta-share, delta-share.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So, boy, I'm pretty wrecked.

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm tired.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's been a lot of travel in the past a few weeks.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And now, finally, I have a good stretch where I just

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
get to sit here with the girls.

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That stretch will last for about 11 days, then

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
it's back on the road, more about that in a bit.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And yesterday, of course, the big lawsuit held at the court

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
in Amsterdam, the Netherlands,

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
plaintiffs, being myself, my wife and my daughter,

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
against the Outdox Publishing Corporation,

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
the gossip rag weekend.

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And the two editors in chief,

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
because there's a co-ed leadership there, personally.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And I thought, you know, if we're going to discuss this

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and tell you what went on and what went down and what happened,

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
what better way to do it, then, to do it with my co-plaintive,

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the lovely Patricia Pi, who was up here during the,

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
during the, during the weeds, so on.

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And that you had a cup of tea, and I said,

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
well, you didn't bring any from me?

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Not meaning she'd have to go and get some,

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
but there you go.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's the kind of, that's the kind of gal she is.

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
She'll be back in a couple minutes and we'll talk about that.

110
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Lots of other things I want to try and get to today.

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Let me see, what should we do?

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Okay, just because this is time sensitive.

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Let me get this out of the way right now,

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
because I promise Steve, I would do it.

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Here we go.

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
In three, two, one.

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Hi, this is Steve Webb with the Lightspring podcast.

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Lightspring is a podcast that answers some of the questions

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
that everybody has about God, Jesus, and Faith,

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
whether you're to believe her or not.

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
In three, two, one.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So if you don't normally listen to Godcast,

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm extending this invitation to you.

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes, you.

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You can find the show at lightspringpodcast.com

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Two, one.

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
In this week's episode, I answer the question of whether or not

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
there's power in prayer.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What do you think?

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Is there power in prayer?

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Take a listen to the podcast.

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
My answer might just surprise you.

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Of course, life's spring is happy to be a member

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
of the pod show podcast network.

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And I've been hitting you right between the years

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
with a message of hope, love, and good news

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
since October, 2004.

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Two, one.

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I dare you.

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Take a listen to the lightspring podcast.

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This week at lightspringpodcast.com.

143
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
All right, Steve.

144
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Come closer.

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Psst.

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
How are you, baby?

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh, you're getting situated there.

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay.

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah.

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Okay.

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Do you like the stool?

152
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Is that good for you?

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's the one that our fans and brought over,

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
remember?

155
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You weren't here when you brought it.

156
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's an lovely stool.

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yes.

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah.

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Move the thing.

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You want to use your headphones?

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
See?

162
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeah.

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let me just everything for you.

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You used to be a singer.

165
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah.

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm adjusting my.

167
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
My grabbing.

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Grabbing them.

169
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
My grabbing the shaft of the stand.

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's a very professional grab there, baby.

171
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Mm-hmm.

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Okay.

173
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And it's the headphones a little shitty ever

174
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
since Christina Barnum.

175
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
For the work.

176
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah.

177
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
They work.

178
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm not touching them.

179
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah.

180
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Don't touch it.

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
No.

182
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Hey, baby.

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
How you doing?

184
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,500
Yeah.

185
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
I heard it snowing in Holland.

186
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
Oh, yeah.

187
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Yesterday in Holland, it was, she was crap.

188
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
It was so cold.

189
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,500
I had, um, I had Eric, I told you that I had one of,

190
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Eric had one of his guys got and get me a delivery.

191
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
Yeah.

192
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
For Michael Jackson and you of Michael Jackson.

193
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Excuse me.

194
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Excuse me.

195
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,500
George Michael Jackson.

196
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,500
I wish he did.

197
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
No.

198
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,500
George Michael.

199
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Yeah.

200
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Eric supplies George Michael as well.

201
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Yeah.

202
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Yeah.

203
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
He does international deliveries.

204
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Just tell me where you're parked and we'll bring it to you.

205
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Um, RB wrote me an email.

206
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Said, Adam, I just listened to your show before going to court.

207
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Sure.

208
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Hope you weren't lighting up a split before your court appearance.

209
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Didn't I ask you?

210
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Exactly what you asked.

211
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Didn't know, baby.

212
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,500
I'm clear.

213
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
I'm completely clear.

214
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,500
I, uh, he says.

215
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,500
I used to do a magic act a year ago and lit up before opening for the,

216
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
for the Steve Miller band in Pasadena.

217
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Man.

218
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,500
What a mistake that was.

219
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Everything went wrong.

220
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
And I have no idea what I did on stage.

221
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
But the band really liked it.

222
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
Yeah.

223
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Do you think they're on the same level perhaps?

224
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Yeah.

225
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
I think so.

226
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
I think you functioning very good.

227
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Yeah.

228
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,500
Why?

229
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Yeah.

230
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,500
I don't see a difference.

231
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Mm-hmm.

232
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
But that's because I'm always this way.

233
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Less, lesser aggressive.

234
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Less aggressive.

235
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Yeah.

236
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
But, but friendly.

237
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
And, uh, well, maybe I, you know what, maybe I shouldn't.

238
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,500
The frames are wide open.

239
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Mm-hmm.

240
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,500
Oh, yeah.

241
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Maybe I shouldn't consume before doing a show because people like it

242
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,500
want to get really pissed off.

243
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
That's what they said.

244
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Yeah.

245
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
Yeah.

246
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
Yeah.

247
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
That's how it's turned got to famous, you know.

248
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
No.

249
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
No.

250
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
No.

251
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
No.

252
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,500
No.

253
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
No.

254
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
No.

255
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,500
No.

256
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
How it's turned got famous by putting lesbians on a show.

257
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Ah.

258
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
That is the clue.

259
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Yes.

260
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,500
That is the true clue to ratings, but an answer.

261
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
Daring to used a word to life to be a.

262
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Lovely.

263
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
Yeah.

264
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
You know how Americans love that.

265
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
Ah.

266
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
So, um.

267
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,500
I said last night, when I came home, I said, you got to come on the show because that's the best way to talk about about the lawsuit.

268
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
So I can explain it because you weren't there.

269
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Yeah.

270
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Yeah.

271
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,500
You did a good job.

272
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
Yeah.

273
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
How do you know?

274
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
Well, because my family was watching TV.

275
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Oh, the news reports.

276
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
You had a couple of quotes there.

277
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,500
Yeah.

278
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Yeah.

279
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
So, you want to get into it now?

280
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Yes?

281
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Or should we, um.

282
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
How far do we get into it?

283
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Oh, baby.

284
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,500
How far do you want to go?

285
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
No.

286
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
I think that's probably best.

287
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Yeah.

288
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
It's not necessary to throw it mod.

289
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
Throw it mod.

290
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Translation.

291
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Very nice.

292
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Wait.

293
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,500
But first, first, you know, he doesn't call often, but when he does, I have to put him on the show.

294
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Oh, okay.

295
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Okay.

296
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Oh.

297
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Come on.

298
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
You ready, young?

299
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:40,500
Here's another message from the Rages of the Rages of the Rages of the Rages of the Rages.

300
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Hello, I'm Roger here.

301
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,500
I just think catching up on your tele messages.

302
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,500
And I thought I'd like to mention, I don't actually drive a car or a mini.

303
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
I used to drive a box so now, there.

304
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,500
But I had a nice next step and now I'm found.

305
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
So I have to work everywhere.

306
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,500
and also take the bus, but that's even very expensive these days.

307
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,500
I'm not quite sure who's been hanging around outside your house, but it's not me.

308
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,500
I think you've got to be very careful because there's lots of sensory people out there

309
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,500
and there's only so many covers in the phone book.

310
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,500
You never know who you've got out there, it's probably that comic shit blogger

311
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,500
because he seems a bit involved in writing all those nasty things about you.

312
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,500
He traces all those pictures of you on his website

313
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,500
and I don't think that's very normal behaviour.

314
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,500
But the great careful with Jacket or where his name is

315
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,500
is looking at his blog, he seems very obsessed with you.

316
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,500
He knows this kind of person he drives and many as well.

317
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Anyway, everything goes well with those nasty magazines

318
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
and it's some consolation.

319
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,500
I have my picture in the local newspaper a while ago

320
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,500
and my solicitor made the mission a form of a policy.

321
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,500
But please I do the same for you too.

322
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Although they'll probably say sorry in the small print at the back.

323
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,500
Anyway, I'm a phone now, can have been out for the evening.

324
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
So, made the wincey with you.

325
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Roger, are you stirring the shit up here?

326
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Yeah.

327
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:14,500
What was that knife of Paul McCartney to do that jingle?

328
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Yeah.

329
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
I was just thinking.

330
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,500
Yeah.

331
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Mac and me, you know, like this.

332
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,500
That's the Jeff Smith.

333
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
We did that.

334
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Okay.

335
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,500
My blog Barry's going.

336
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Excuse me.

337
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Hold on.

338
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,500
Let me just see.

339
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Talk amongst yourselves.

340
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
Oh.

341
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,500
Okay.

342
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
When I hear that guy on the phone,

343
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,500
I have to think about Betty.

344
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Remember?

345
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,500
Yeah.

346
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Hold on a second.

347
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
There we go.

348
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,500
Okay.

349
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,500
Here we go.

350
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
So, the lawsuit.

351
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Yeah.

352
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Let's just set the stage real quickly.

353
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Everyone knows we're talking about.

354
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,500
Yeah.

355
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,500
Yeah.

356
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,500
A Dutch magazine took pictures off of this two parts to this.

357
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,500
Took pictures off of my flicker, strut, my flicker sight, which by the way.

358
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Let's just say one thing.

359
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
Yeah.

360
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,500
In the Netherlands, the word flicker has 99% of the population.

361
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,500
When they hear the word flicker, they think, homosexual.

362
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Yeah.

363
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Because the word, you know, the derogatory term, as we would say, Fag, is flicker.

364
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Yeah.

365
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
So, even though you spell it differently.

366
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
But an English flickering flicker.

367
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Yeah.

368
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Well, the spelling is F-L-I-C-K-R, which is, of course, very web 2-O hit trendy.

369
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
But so, it's kind of funny.

370
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
You know, all these people talking about flicker this and flicker that.

371
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Yeah.

372
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
There were some snickers in the courtroom, by the way.

373
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500
And by the way.

374
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,500
Yes.

375
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
That magazine is not just a nice magazine.

376
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
It's just a gossip magazine.

377
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
It's a flicker magazine.

378
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
So, did you know that?

379
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,500
You know, it's not even okay or hello or in style, for example.

380
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,500
Oh, no, no, no.

381
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,500
It's a really, it's, you know, it's a rag is what it is.

382
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Okay.

383
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Supermarket.

384
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500
Right.

385
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Right.

386
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,500
Now, let's just preface this by saying that you and I have been together for 20 years.

387
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,500
We've been very, very well-known in the Netherlands all that time.

388
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
That is not stopped.

389
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
So much to our measurement, by the way.

390
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,500
We lived in the United States for 14 years, and we came back and we were still well-known.

391
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Well, escaped it also the first time, because when we got together and we went out together,

392
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,500
that was a big thing.

393
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Because no, because you were a scorned woman, because you had an affair with me.

394
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
You had an affair with me?

395
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,500
Divorced.

396
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Yes.

397
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Not even when I found you.

398
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,500
It's horrible, horrible, horrible, but bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

399
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,500
And you were younger 15 years younger.

400
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
So, that was a big thing.

401
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,500
We had the paparazzi sitting in the garbage cans.

402
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,500
Yeah.

403
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
It was kind of like a dame more ashton-coached cushioner.

404
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
Yeah.

405
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Yeah.

406
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Yeah.

407
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
I just had a visual for a second there.

408
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
I was doing dame.

409
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
How would you like, do you like ashton?

410
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
No.

411
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,500
No.

412
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,500
No.

413
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
I don't see it.

414
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
No, no.

415
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
No.

416
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,500
We were.

417
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Okay.

418
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Okay.

419
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,500
Anyway, they took pictures off of my flicker side.

420
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
And here's what they did.

421
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,500
They followed Patricia around and Christina apparently.

422
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,500
Yeah.

423
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,500
And they took a picture of you.

424
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,500
And you know, I'm sure they took many, many pictures of you.

425
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
You were shopping at Saintsbury.

426
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,500
Didn't know anything.

427
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Right.

428
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,500
So, it doesn't matter.

429
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,500
Even if you had the most beautiful clothes on, we're completely ready for a photo shoot.

430
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
There's always a shitty picture.

431
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500
So, they're looking for a shit.

432
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,500
That's a new thing.

433
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,500
They're looking for the shittiest photo that they have.

434
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
So, they can say, look.

435
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,500
She looks like shit.

436
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
And you didn't even look that shitty.

437
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Hey.

438
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
Don't break the studio.

439
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Yeah.

440
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
That's shitty.

441
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,500
I thought it.

442
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,500
I did.

443
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,500
No, it wasn't that bad.

444
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,500
You know, when you normally actually a normal person who does.

445
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Looks like that.

446
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
No.

447
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
No, look.

448
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
Look like you and you look shitty.

449
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Who carries the grocery bags in her car.

450
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
And you were looking down.

451
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
Pools faces.

452
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
Yeah.

453
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
You pulled us a face.

454
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Yeah.

455
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
Put that on.

456
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Okay.

457
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
So, that face, you know, was.

458
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
That's the poop face.

459
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500
On the cover.

460
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
That's it.

461
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
That's when you're trying to pinch one off.

462
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Yeah.

463
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,500
Okay.

464
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,500
And that face was on the cover of the magazine.

465
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,500
Yes.

466
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Correct.

467
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
And it was full page.

468
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,500
And the gist of them of the article was, you know, they say that everything is all

469
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
Hunky Dory, but it's really all crappy.

470
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,500
No.

471
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Look at Patricia's face for Christ's sake.

472
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
I'm happy.

473
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
It must be poopy.

474
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,500
Very unhappy.

475
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:31,500
And so, to prove this contrast inside, they took these pictures of our trip to America.

476
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Yes.

477
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
Well, we were in New York and San Francisco.

478
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,500
When we were sick actually, and I took a picture of the three of us in Central Park.

479
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
You had the flu.

480
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Yeah.

481
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Boy, that's bad.

482
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Well, remember that.

483
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Bad hair day.

484
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Yeah.

485
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
And, and quite honestly, of course, these are great pictures.

486
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,500
You know, that's why I published them on the on my family.

487
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
I put a muffler.

488
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
And on the knees.

489
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Did you just broke?

490
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,500
No.

491
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
On this show.

492
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
You know what happened.

493
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
What do you have to say?

494
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
Did that burn?

495
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,500
Yeah.

496
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
What do you have to say?

497
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
What do you have to say?

498
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,500
Excuse me.

499
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,500
Well, senseo.

500
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Oh, senseo.

501
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Thanks for listening.

502
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
Oh.

503
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
For the past year and a half.

504
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
But I'm not a coffee drink.

505
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,500
No.

506
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
Okay.

507
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,500
But from now on, whenever you hear a book,

508
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
the day I've been didn't go down very well.

509
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,500
But anyway, and underneath these lovely holiday pictures,

510
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,500
I said, yeah, look, they're playing like it's nice, but it's not good.

511
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
No.

512
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
No.

513
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
It's horrible.

514
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
No.

515
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
And they're sitting in a limo.

516
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
No.

517
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,500
He can afford a limo.

518
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,500
No.

519
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
No.

520
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
Okay.

521
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
Okay.

522
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
But that doesn't matter because in 20 years that we've been together,

523
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
we've never sued a magazine ever.

524
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Never sued a gossip magazine for anything.

525
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Never.

526
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Because we think, you know, you are out there.

527
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
We did our things.

528
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,500
We did our appearances.

529
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,500
We were famous.

530
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,500
That's what we were working for.

531
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
And sometimes these sort of things.

532
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,500
You know, that's the other side.

533
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Yeah.

534
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
I mean.

535
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
So.

536
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
That's the way it works.

537
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,500
That's the way it works.

538
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
That's the game.

539
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
That.

540
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Silicier.

541
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
Hmm.

542
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Okay.

543
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,500
So that isn't the game.

544
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,500
No.

545
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
No problem.

546
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
And they've said some shitty things about us.

547
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,500
And they've told lots of untruths and lies.

548
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Of course.

549
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
But these are gossip magazine.

550
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,500
And on the other side, we use them to sell things.

551
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
You know.

552
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Absolutely.

553
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
It works both ways.

554
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Yeah.

555
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
We know how to play the game.

556
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Let's be honest.

557
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
However, there are rules to the game.

558
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,500
Yes.

559
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
I think so too.

560
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,500
One of the rules is people can stand outside your house and take as many pictures of

561
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,500
they want as they want.

562
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,500
But they cannot take pictures of you while you're in your house.

563
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,500
If you're in your house, they can't take it.

564
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Well, they can take it.

565
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,500
But they can't publish a picture that has been taken through the window.

566
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Yeah.

567
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Now, if you're in your back garden.

568
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
Or if you're on your balcony.

569
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,500
It's, you know, there's jurisprudence that says they can publish that.

570
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,500
So, so really your final privacy is easy.

571
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,500
Even if you're in your bare butt, they can take the picture.

572
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Yeah.

573
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
So that is preferred, of course.

574
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,500
Yes.

575
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Of course.

576
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:04,500
Now, just in normal publishing terms, well, before I get to that, they also followed

577
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
our daughter Christina.

578
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Yeah.

579
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:13,500
And we know that because written in the text of this article was the name of her school

580
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,500
and how she is transported there every single day.

581
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,500
How do they know that?

582
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Of course.

583
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,500
How do they know?

584
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Because they've been watching these editors or one of these editors ordered some

585
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,500
guys.

586
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Some greasy ass guy in a trench coat is the way I envision him with a fucking lens to follow

587
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
my daughter.

588
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Yeah.

589
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,500
I don't care who's following my daughter.

590
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,500
She's 15.

591
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,500
That's not okay.

592
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,500
No.

593
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,500
That is just not okay.

594
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,500
No.

595
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
So, that is endangerment of a child.

596
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
Unless we say, can you follow my daughter?

597
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,500
Yeah.

598
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Well, there's some guys that, that's not a story.

599
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,500
There's some guys that I told not to follow my daughter in case some other

600
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
motherfuckers shows up.

601
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
So, no worries.

602
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Yeah.

603
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
It's all good.

604
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Now, so that of course is subject to how you want to interpret the words, what is danger,

605
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:02,500
you know, there's all kinds of things that can be taken into consideration, but any parent

606
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,500
will agree.

607
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,500
That's not okay.

608
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,500
If you, if you, if you are a parent, you know that's that doesn't feel good at all.

609
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
And it's just wrong.

610
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
It's wrong.

611
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Okay.

612
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Follow me.

613
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,500
Do the same as Barry.

614
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Doesn't matter.

615
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,500
Yeah.

616
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Take my ugly face and put it on the cover.

617
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,500
It wasn't ugly, huh?

618
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,500
It doesn't matter.

619
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,500
It doesn't matter, but don't do that to my daughter.

620
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Right.

621
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Now, they took these pictures from my flicker feed and every single picture that I have

622
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:35,500
up there, public, is marked as creative comments, share a like, non-commercial attribution.

623
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Yeah.

624
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,500
So, the, the important part here is the non-commercial part of the license.

625
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,500
Now, this whole creative comment is not a small thing.

626
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,500
You know, this is set up by Lawrence Lessig of Stanford University.

627
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
It's, it's adopted globally.

628
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:53,500
People rely on this for protection for their intellectual property.

629
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
Yeah.

630
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:04,500
And the, the, the, the, the magazine and the editors, they basically had to come into court and explain

631
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,500
what, you know, why they felt justified to take those pictures and publish it.

632
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
Exactly.

633
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Because they can't read English.

634
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,500
Because it's clearly, well, the part of that was the part of their defense.

635
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Yeah.

636
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,500
He set the stage for a second.

637
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Okay.

638
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
So, I have taxi Eric who's all dressed up.

639
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,500
He, you know, of course he takes care of all the logistics for us in Holland.

640
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,500
So, he's dressed up and looks like a secret agent.

641
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,500
Totally James Bond.

642
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Yeah.

643
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Exactly.

644
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,500
Exactly.

645
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Yeah.

646
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,500
You know, he's overcoat, little oversized, overcoat, you know, he's kind of walking.

647
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,500
Yeah.

648
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
He looks, he looks perfect for the posse.

649
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
Gold rings.

650
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Yeah.

651
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,500
And what's that?

652
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,500
What?

653
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
He has the walk.

654
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
Yeah.

655
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,500
Exactly.

656
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:51,500
So, we have our lead attorney, Christ from Popula Stain, Abibushnach.

657
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,500
Christ is, he's a, he's a pretty scary guy.

658
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
Yeah.

659
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
He's like partially bald.

660
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,500
And he always has like, that shitty ring on his face.

661
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
Yeah.

662
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
You know, you just want to have him on your son.

663
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Yeah.

664
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,500
Don't fuck with me face.

665
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,500
Yeah.

666
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,500
And then we had young villain who was an associate who actually, you know, wrote a lot of the stuff.

667
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,500
So you had two.

668
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,500
Yeah.

669
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,500
And young villain was my size and, you know, kind of a big, like, all off-looking guy.

670
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,500
You know, so it's all right.

671
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,500
I think we had a pretty good posse.

672
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Yeah.

673
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,500
Now, what was interesting is the news organizations that will news.

674
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,500
I mean, the, kind of like the entertainment tonight news organizations.

675
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:33,500
They had requested to film to record video during the, during the session during the, during the suit.

676
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,500
Two programs.

677
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,500
Yeah.

678
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,500
Exactly.

679
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
And so they asked me to, do you mind?

680
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
I don't care.

681
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
I mean, that's fine.

682
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Yeah.

683
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Yeah.

684
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
And stuff like that.

685
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
Yeah.

686
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,500
Can be very helpful for other people.

687
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
So when we get there, the camera crews were there.

688
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,500
But it turns out that the magazine and the publisher refused.

689
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,500
They didn't want any cameras in the court.

690
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,500
I mean, a gossip magazine, you all, I mean, this, I was blown away by that.

691
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
Oh, they were shy.

692
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,500
Yeah.

693
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,500
All of a sudden they were shy.

694
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,500
Yeah.

695
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
You know, what's, you know, what's a real bummer?

696
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,500
Yeah.

697
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,500
I'm just thinking you're car right now, listening to this on serious satellite stars 103.

698
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:18,500
And you're not going to hear the ending of it because the satellite window closes and, if it's, if it goes to Hellway, it comes up next.

699
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,500
So, so, well, but when they get home, when they get to the office, go to dailysourceco.com, download the show.

700
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
And you can hear the rest of it.

701
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,500
Yeah.

702
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
Oh, you know, that podcast, and you should look into it.

703
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
It's pretty cool.

704
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,500
Okay.

705
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,500
So they're gone now.

706
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Okay.

707
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Where was I?

708
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Oh, yeah.

709
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:40,500
The judge, then, before, before we started, the judge called in the, my two lawyers and their one lawyer.

710
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,500
It was as geeky looking.

711
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,500
If you put two, two bolts here in his neck, he was totally frank and stunned.

712
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,500
Yeah.

713
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,500
Yeah, but it's like a lurchy guy.

714
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,500
Sometimes it doesn't matter.

715
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
You know that.

716
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,500
Yeah.

717
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,500
But it may be feel good at the time.

718
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Yeah.

719
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
I know.

720
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,500
Okay.

721
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Okay.

722
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,500
Of course, it doesn't matter.

723
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,500
It makes no difference at all.

724
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,500
But as it turns out, anyway.

725
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,500
I had geeky guy a couple of times in the courtroom and defending me.

726
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,500
And I lost.

727
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,500
Yeah.

728
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
No, exactly.

729
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,500
And I was telling these guys.

730
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,500
I'm like, hey.

731
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,500
It's true, but you never know.

732
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,500
I was telling, I'm saying, okay, guys, listen.

733
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Let's do this right.

734
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,500
You know, let's just sit there.

735
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
This is always so dry.

736
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
These Dutch court cases.

737
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,500
Yeah.

738
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,500
You know, you watch TV.

739
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,500
You watch Boston legal.

740
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,500
You're like, you know, besides the fact that the office is filled with groovy, you know,

741
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
by sexual chicks.

742
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,500
Yeah.

743
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,500
You know, there's all this like.

744
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,500
There's professional suits on.

745
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
Right.

746
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
Yeah.

747
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,500
Exactly.

748
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,500
So I said, listen, guys, I want some Danny Crane.

749
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
Danny Crane.

750
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,500
Yeah.

751
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,500
Yeah.

752
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
And in a couple of times during the, during the case, I went, I.

753
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,500
Danny Crane.

754
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500
Yeah.

755
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,500
So, and, and, but, help, they really hit.

756
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,500
It made a difference.

757
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,500
But they, they knew that you meant be cool.

758
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,500
Yeah.

759
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
And it's psychological.

760
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,500
And they were very cool.

761
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,500
And these guys are pros.

762
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,500
They're really good.

763
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,500
I've done this a couple of times before.

764
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,500
You know, it's very good because we have American listens.

765
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,500
And listeners, and they have no idea how it works in how it works.

766
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,500
Oh, let me, yeah.

767
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
Let me just say.

768
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
And I've mentioned this before.

769
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,500
But there is no jury system in the Netherlands, not for criminal or civil court.

770
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,500
It's just a professional judge system.

771
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,500
One judge.

772
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
Yeah.

773
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,500
So the judge is going to listen.

774
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,500
It reads the documents, listens to the arguments, and then makes a decision.

775
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,500
That's, that's how it goes.

776
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,500
And he's stomach hurts.

777
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,500
And he has a fight at home.

778
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,500
He's in a bad mood.

779
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
Well, no.

780
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,500
You're fine.

781
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,500
Let me just say one thing.

782
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,500
I do believe that the professional judges who are in the system really believe in the system,

783
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,500
and really work it.

784
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
I mean, I just don't believe in the system.

785
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
That's nothing against judges.

786
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,500
I don't think they use their gut feeling.

787
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
Yeah, but they're not supposed to.

788
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
No, that's why the line.

789
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
So you always get something different.

790
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,500
They're not well.

791
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
And then the Netherlands, of course, is always.

792
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,500
Why don't we just come to a compromise.

793
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,500
There's always a compromise.

794
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
It's never a clear cut winner in it.

795
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,500
I think it's too much about the rules or the rules.

796
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
Yeah, but they look at it exactly.

797
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,500
Well, we can argue this for a hundred, a hundred years.

798
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,500
But I mean, the way the system, I don't like the system.

799
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,500
I think it's a bad system, but I do think they try their best to make the system work.

800
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
So let me just, let's just say that.

801
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
That's true.

802
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Okay.

803
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
And this judge, a woman.

804
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:19,500
She's known for intellectual copyright about intellectual property cases.

805
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,500
Yeah, she's probably somewhere between my age and your age.

806
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,500
I guess.

807
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,500
I think somewhere on that.

808
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,500
Maybe younger.

809
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,500
No, I think she was older than I was.

810
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,500
But somewhere in between.

811
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,500
Laskar.

812
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:38,500
Yeah, but, you know, I like the, oh, so she overruled the.

813
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:43,500
The request by the magazine to have no cameras in the court room.

814
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,500
She overruled it.

815
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,500
And talk like, oh, that's kind of cool.

816
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
And you know, I hadn't met her yet.

817
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
I thought that was a very interesting.

818
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,500
Of course.

819
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,500
So these schmucks, they record everything.

820
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,500
And you know, what do they use like, you know, us walking into the courtroom?

821
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,500
It's like Christal mighty idiots.

822
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
Yeah.

823
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,500
Okay.

824
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,500
So I showed up, of course, representing us with with our attorneys.

825
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:12,500
And this guy, Mark Funderlinda, who was the, who's the editor, who shares this co-editor

826
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,500
ship with this other girl, Peter of Boats.

827
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,500
He wrote the whole piece.

828
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Oh, I don't even know who wrote it because there was no buy line there.

829
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Yeah, but then I know that it was him.

830
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
Well, usually it's him.

831
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,500
So he didn't show up because he apparently had a fall in luck.

832
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
And left where he was slipped.

833
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,500
He was, you know, following celebrities around.

834
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
He was leeching and left.

835
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,500
Yeah.

836
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
He was following them around and then he slipped.

837
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,500
Yes.

838
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
And he slipped and he couldn't make it.

839
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,500
Okay.

840
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,500
So the better boats can.

841
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,500
And you know what?

842
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,500
She should really change her hair color because she's giving the whole dumb blonde thing

843
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
like too much.

844
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,500
Yeah, credit.

845
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
Too much credit.

846
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
I mean, I'm sorry.

847
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,500
You know, it's just, she just doesn't seem very bright.

848
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,500
She didn't say anything throughout the entire court case.

849
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,500
Throughout the entire case.

850
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,500
Not one word.

851
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,500
No.

852
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,500
You know, and I was talking on doing all kinds of stuff.

853
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
You know, you know me.

854
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:13,500
Oh, let's just say the best news of the entire day.

855
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,500
No Donald Trump hair.

856
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,500
Ah.

857
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,500
The hair.

858
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
I actually got the hair pretty good now.

859
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,500
Lucky luck.

860
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,520
Lucky luck.

861
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,520
Lucky luck.

862
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,500
Lucky luck.

863
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
Lucky luck.

864
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,520
Lucky luck.

865
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,520
Look.

866
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,520
Lucky luck.

867
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,520
You saw the hair.

868
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,520
Look pretty good.

869
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,520
That's the hair that I always say.

870
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,520
Right.

871
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,520
And Donald Trump hair.

872
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,520
Right, but I didn't have that did I do.

873
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,520
No.

874
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,520
You did your best.

875
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
Okay.

876
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,520
Because what I said was a jury.

877
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,520
He said fine, how was your hair?

878
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,520
She didn't ask about my hair first.

879
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,520
And it's not because he needs good hair,

880
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,520
no, because he makes he just cannot do his hair.

881
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,520
But if I have the hair, then I have the confidence.

882
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,520
It's my main. It's my armor.

883
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,520
If I let you do your hair, then you look like a sort of blonde,

884
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,520
Elvis Presley.

885
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,520
Yeah, you just put a little bit of water in it.

886
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,520
No, throw it back.

887
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,520
Stop about the hair, okay? Enough about the hair.

888
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,520
That would, people know that you don't care about your hair.

889
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,520
It's nice to know.

890
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,520
No, I do care about my hair because I want it to look right

891
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,520
because that gives me confidence.

892
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,520
Of course, of course.

893
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,520
Okay, so I care.

894
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
Yeah.

895
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,520
On top of that, instead of my regular blue contact lenses,

896
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,520
because I thought it would be stunningly beautiful.

897
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,520
It turns out that the guide gave us the wrong ones

898
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,520
and had green contact lenses.

899
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,520
Yeah, what was that?

900
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,520
Which made my eyes look like two black holes.

901
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,520
Yeah, very dark.

902
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
But I didn't want my glasses on because of it.

903
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,520
No, I know.

904
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,520
Because I think this stuff is important, you know?

905
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
Yes.

906
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,520
But again, whether you're appealing to a jury or a judge,

907
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,520
I mean, I know.

908
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
I'm taking this shit really, really serious.

909
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,520
That's what I wanted to say.

910
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,520
Everything needs to be out.

911
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,520
That was the statement.

912
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
Yes.

913
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,520
So then we read our whole thing, right?

914
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,520
And here's what I liked about the judge,

915
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,520
because the lawyers get up and then first the plaintiffs,

916
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,520
you know, we had this brief of like 46 or 47 different points,

917
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,520
which is, you know, what we claim,

918
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,520
what the law is, jurisprudence,

919
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,520
what the conclusion is.

920
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,520
And so, you know, our guy actually reads that.

921
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,520
He reads it from the paper.

922
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,520
Well, I'm going like, denny crane.

923
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,520
But the judge, the judge, even though she's given a copy,

924
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,520
she didn't read it.

925
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,520
She actually put her glasses on top of her head and just listened.

926
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,520
And as she listened, she was looking around

927
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,520
at different people's reactions during different pieces.

928
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
Very, very smart, very smart.

929
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,520
And so then they go woman.

930
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,520
Yeah, oh yeah.

931
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,520
Very good.

932
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,520
So then the other guys get to do it.

933
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,520
And oh my God.

934
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,520
I brought it home with you.

935
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,520
It's just so funny.

936
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
Yeah.

937
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,520
So let's just on the pictures for a second,

938
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,520
because that's where the real legal stuff happens.

939
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,520
They claim that when you move your mouse over a picture on flicker.

940
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,520
Yeah.

941
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,520
They claim that something pops up a message that says,

942
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,520
this photo is public.

943
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,520
Now, that's true.

944
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,520
It's public.

945
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,520
That means it's public too.

946
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,520
You can look at it.

947
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,520
And underneath it actually says under certain restrictions.

948
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,520
And it has a concrete created creative comments logo.

949
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:15,520
The seas with a copyright is very internationally acknowledged stuff.

950
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,520
I know.

951
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,520
But they know that, of course.

952
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,520
I mean, let's not kid each other because they're professional.

953
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,520
Right.

954
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,520
But well, this is what the judge said because they had printouts and screen grabs.

955
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,520
And they're just proving that it's confusing.

956
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,520
And that and they had no idea of your happiness.

957
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
And you should go boost.

958
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,520
All that stuff.

959
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,520
Yeah.

960
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,520
It's an important thing for them on their list.

961
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,520
Little list was all disgusting things.

962
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,520
They're asking for it.

963
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,520
Hold on.

964
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,520
No.

965
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,520
Stop.

966
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,520
You're telling the story the wrong way.

967
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,520
Oh, is that so?

968
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
Yeah.

969
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,520
Yeah.

970
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
But that comes later.

971
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,520
I'm way ahead.

972
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,520
Yes.

973
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,520
Stick with the program.

974
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,520
Hold on to my co-tails, baby.

975
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:00,520
So they had all these different explanations for why they didn't see it.

976
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,520
They also said, hey, look, it's available.

977
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:08,520
All these pictures are available in multiple resolutions, including very high quality, which is

978
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,520
plainly, definitely intended for magazines.

979
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,520
That's what you said.

980
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,520
And flicker is only full of promotional pictures.

981
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,520
And it's just fun.

982
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,520
And it's just mucking about.

983
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
Mucking about.

984
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,520
Mucking about.

985
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,520
And.

986
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,520
And so, you know, so then we kind of go back and forth.

987
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,520
And I say, you know, you're on her.

988
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,520
And I was I had all the right word.

989
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,520
You have to say eight left butter for our own and all that stuff.

990
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,520
You know, I really tried to respect her position.

991
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,520
So I really was very.

992
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,520
I thought it was quite polite and correct.

993
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,520
I said, you know, I don't take this.

994
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,520
I don't see this as fun and games at all.

995
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,520
I mean, this is really serious stuff.

996
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,520
This is a part of our company.

997
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:49,520
Our company, our media company, the personal Adam Curry Patricia Pi, media company, which

998
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,520
is registered as such.

999
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,520
Yeah.

1000
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:57,520
You know, spans across web logs, online stores, which you've had.

1001
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,520
Pictures, podcasts, video podcasts.

1002
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,520
It's a part of the new media.

1003
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,520
Yeah.

1004
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,520
And we need to respect the same intellectual property rules.

1005
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,520
In the new media as as the old media respects from us.

1006
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,520
You know, this is this is this is critical stuff.

1007
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,520
And you can't just go taking it.

1008
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,520
It's stealing.

1009
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,520
And so this this debate kind of went back and forth.

1010
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,520
And I got into it and I said, look, you know,

1011
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,520
first of all, any editor who respects himself after making this huge intellectual

1012
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,520
property violation knowingly should resign.

1013
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,520
So I'm not only want any money from this, just make the guy resign.

1014
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,520
We have to send a message.

1015
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,520
We have to send a message that there is a line in the sand.

1016
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:46,520
And the the genesis of this is that when I when my lawyer first sent the letter to them,

1017
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,520
hey, you violated our copyright by publishing our pictures.

1018
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,520
They said, oh, well, here's 1500 euros, which is like three times

1019
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,520
the going rate and you should just shut up and be happy with it.

1020
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:01,520
We offer them money, which is a very common occurrence, by the way.

1021
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,520
But it's it's not right.

1022
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,520
You can't steal something knowing that I'll just pay them off later.

1023
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,520
I mean, you're still stealing.

1024
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,520
Then it's done.

1025
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,520
Yeah, you're still stealing.

1026
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,520
And of course photographers who just take pictures and sell them for living,

1027
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,520
you know, they'll take that.

1028
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,520
I mean, they're part of the problem because I'll take that three times the amount.

1029
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,520
You know, go ahead, steal my pictures all you want.

1030
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,520
I didn't offer them to take care.

1031
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,520
No, of course not, of course not.

1032
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,520
So, you know, that was kind of their their whole defense saying, well, it was hard to

1033
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,520
hard to figure out what what the license was, you know, and pictures are they

1034
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,520
actually literally said, once a picture, once something is put on the internet,

1035
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
it has no value.

1036
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,520
It has no value.

1037
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,520
And I said, well, that's really interesting.

1038
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,520
Say, my podcast does pretty damn well.

1039
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,520
Thank you very much.

1040
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,520
And I gave it away.

1041
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
Yeah.

1042
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,520
And I let people copy it.

1043
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,520
And I said, but you can just download this stuff.

1044
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,520
It's available for download for everyone.

1045
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,520
I said, yeah, absolutely.

1046
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,520
You can download my pictures all you want.

1047
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,520
There are rules.

1048
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,520
But you can't publish them.

1049
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,520
Now.

1050
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,520
Downloading is not the same as publishing.

1051
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,520
So, I started to use some pretty big words like theft and, you know,

1052
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,520
violations of intellectual property.

1053
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:11,520
And the judge said, well, Mr. Curry, say, you're using some pretty big words here

1054
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,520
for, you know, the crime that has been committed, the taking of a picture.

1055
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,520
She said, you know, what exactly would the damages be?

1056
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,520
If she's trying to get a numb, because she knows that she's going to decide that they,

1057
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,520
I think, that they violated the rules.

1058
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,520
The thing here is, what is the value of those pictures?

1059
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,520
You know, and so there are two ways I could have gone.

1060
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,520
I could have gone and said, well, you know, we've sold pictures in the past,

1061
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,520
which I don't think we've ever done.

1062
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,520
Oh, one Christina was born.

1063
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,520
We sold, actually we didn't sell pictures.

1064
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,520
We had pictures made.

1065
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,520
And then they wrote a check in Christina's name.

1066
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,520
But I mean, you could come up with ways to measure it, but I'm not interested in that.

1067
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,520
So I wouldn't answer the question I said.

1068
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,520
But I was expecting, I was expecting it.

1069
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,520
Yeah.

1070
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,520
And here's what I said.

1071
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,520
I said, these are the exact same terms.

1072
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:08,520
Theavory, huge loss of income that are used by the RIA, the MPA, the, I used the Dutch,

1073
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,520
Bhuma Stamina, ASCAP BMI, said the business software alliance.

1074
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,520
And she was nodding her head because, you know, she's done these cases and I said,

1075
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,520
Yeah.

1076
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,520
So you're telling me that a song that you buy for 99 cents,

1077
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,520
when someone copies that illegally and put and shares it with someone else,

1078
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,520
why all of a sudden can they get a $150,000 lawsuit?

1079
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,520
And I can't.

1080
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,520
No.

1081
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
Yeah.

1082
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,520
And that was the tipping point.

1083
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,520
And I saw her brain go, oh, click.

1084
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,520
Yeah.

1085
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,520
Hold on a second.

1086
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,520
So I'm just here as the guy who was only hearing about,

1087
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,520
we can't rip off the big companies because they're going to take, you know,

1088
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,520
they're going to take you down and then you get, you know, look,

1089
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,520
the housewives, you know, moms who don't even use the computers,

1090
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,520
kids have shared some file and they get, you know,

1091
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,520
the $150,000 lawsuit, but they can settle it for 15,000,

1092
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,520
and not go to court.

1093
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,520
And it's fucking crazy.

1094
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,520
Yes.

1095
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,520
And she got it.

1096
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,520
So what I basically said is all I'm asking for is a signal.

1097
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:10,520
And the signal has to be very clear that it has to stop the idea of

1098
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,520
grabbing it and taking it and using it and then paying someone off.

1099
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,520
It stops with me.

1100
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,520
And if you, if you're going to, you know,

1101
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,520
find them 5,000 euros, they're just going to go do it again.

1102
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,520
And I'll be back here next year.

1103
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,520
And the year after that, and someone else is going to be here.

1104
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,520
Yeah.

1105
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,520
And it's a stupid waste of time.

1106
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,520
It's stupid.

1107
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,520
And it's wrong.

1108
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:32,520
It's like getting on the train and not buying a ticket because, you know,

1109
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,520
if I get caught all I have to do is pay the ticket.

1110
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,520
But the whole thing was that they think they can do that to us,

1111
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,520
because no, I'm just in a second.

1112
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
So those are the facts.

1113
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,520
Yeah, I know.

1114
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,520
Okay.

1115
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,520
But they think that we want that.

1116
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,520
Yes.

1117
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,520
Okay.

1118
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,520
So a part of their, a part of their whole defense and argument there,

1119
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,520
was that throughout the years, we have always sought publicity.

1120
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,520
And that all we are about is about publicity and making money.

1121
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,520
That's what I said.

1122
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,520
Yeah.

1123
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,520
Which, of course, is true, but not in this context.

1124
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
But come on.

1125
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,520
We always did it in a very professional way.

1126
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,520
Of course, we're professional.

1127
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,520
Professional.

1128
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,520
Of course.

1129
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,520
And if we do something to start a new magazine or, you know, something that

1130
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,520
people want from us and we say, hey, you're going to earn a lot of money from this,

1131
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,520
let's talk.

1132
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,520
Yeah, because we make money with our brand, with our, with our face, with our talent, with our voice, you know, whatever.

1133
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,520
We have something to sell.

1134
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,520
And we're not supposed to have any business sense.

1135
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,520
I guess that's very foreign to the people like this.

1136
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,520
I don't think that we can have any business sense.

1137
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,520
Wow.

1138
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,520
So.

1139
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,520
I think we did pretty well.

1140
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,520
Yeah, on the, on the picture stuff, definitely.

1141
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:51,520
I mean, if I were, if I were to, I'm just thinking, because these, again,

1142
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,520
the judge may be going for some kind of compromise.

1143
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,520
I mean, what would be great is if, is if they came up with,

1144
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,520
if the judge came up with some kind, I mean, something to send to signal.

1145
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,520
If it's money or whatever it is, but something that really hurts, you know,

1146
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,520
something that makes a difference to that company.

1147
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,520
They have to do something.

1148
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,520
And I'm not looking for money for us.

1149
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,520
I'm just looking for a, you know, that's why I said, just fire this guy.

1150
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,520
Fire the editor and then the next editor will think twice about doing that shit.

1151
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,520
Is that simple? How hard somebody is to start with this?

1152
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,520
Yeah.

1153
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,520
About the Christina stuff.

1154
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,520
I don't know.

1155
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,520
They, I think they'll get a, a reprimand.

1156
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,520
I don't think they'll get anything else.

1157
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,520
I don't think they'll, I don't think they'll be any other.

1158
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,520
Any other sanctions there, anything, anything happening.

1159
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,520
Okay. But, you know, that's our feeling.

1160
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,520
And it is a scary feeling.

1161
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,520
Oh, yeah. No, totally. Totally.

1162
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,520
But, you know, what they said there is that, well, you've continuously put her in the limelight.

1163
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,520
And so, therefore, he's fair game.

1164
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,520
All right.

1165
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,520
Well, she belongs to us. You know, she walks next to us.

1166
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,520
Yeah.

1167
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,520
Yeah.

1168
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,520
It's, uh, it's crazy. But then then.

1169
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,520
And it's not going to stop us from doing nice things that we want to do.

1170
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,520
You know, that we like.

1171
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,520
But this guy blew it this, uh, this Mark guy. He blew it.

1172
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,520
Uh, when we were talking last night.

1173
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,520
Finally, what, what his name is, is, uh, he hates us.

1174
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,520
And I don't know why.

1175
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,520
You, you don't even know him.

1176
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,520
No.

1177
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,520
Did you ever talk to him?

1178
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,520
Uh, once.

1179
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,520
I met him, uh, when I came home, I remember I came home from work.

1180
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,520
One day, and you were being interviewed by him.

1181
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,520
And this is 20, you know, there's eight, 17 years ago.

1182
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,520
Was that him?

1183
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,520
In New Jersey.

1184
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,520
We just lived in New Jersey.

1185
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,520
Yeah.

1186
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,520
And 1718 years ago.

1187
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,520
I think Christina was, uh, just about four years old, three or four years old.

1188
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,520
Oh.

1189
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,520
And, uh, well, then he called me only 11 years ago.

1190
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,520
And he said, we're going to start a new magazine.

1191
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:48,520
Uh, or a new, we'll give it the new phase to avant garde.

1192
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,520
Was it?

1193
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,520
And do you want to do it?

1194
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,520
I have a feeling we're going to get to the bottom of why he hates us with this story.

1195
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,520
No, no, not at all.

1196
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,520
No, not at all.

1197
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,520
That's where I say, and I know him just a little bit.

1198
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,520
Okay.

1199
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,520
And, and said, who are you?

1200
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,520
Because we lived in America.

1201
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,520
I didn't know him.

1202
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,520
And he said, well, I'm actually a very good.

1203
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,520
I'm a real journalist.

1204
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,520
And I write books.

1205
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,520
I said, oh, how interesting.

1206
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,520
And what kind of book do you write?

1207
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,520
He says about the royal family.

1208
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,520
And I thought, well, that's nice.

1209
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,520
That's right.

1210
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,520
He's a royalty expert.

1211
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,520
Yes.

1212
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,520
And of course, it's why he follows us around.

1213
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,520
I just have a new book out of about, uh,

1214
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,520
Beatrix, Queen B.

1215
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,520
Queen B.

1216
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,520
And I said, well, that's nice.

1217
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,520
Sound for him.

1218
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,520
And he sounded very nice.

1219
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,520
And I invited him.

1220
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,520
And I said, well, let's sit down.

1221
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,520
I have a nice, uh, uh, uh, interview.

1222
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,520
And we did.

1223
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,520
And I was a bit disappointed about it.

1224
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,520
Because all the things that we agreed on, uh, he didn't do.

1225
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,520
You know, I always ask, uh, can I read it?

1226
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,520
And if there's anything that's a little bit cold,

1227
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,520
it's a little bit wrong or not my way of saying it.

1228
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,520
Can I change it?

1229
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,520
Sure.

1230
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,520
Sure.

1231
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,520
Never sent it, right?

1232
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,520
Well, he sent it.

1233
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,520
And I.

1234
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,520
You changed it.

1235
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,520
I remember that very clearly.

1236
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,520
Yeah.

1237
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,520
And they never changed.

1238
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,520
You remember what it was.

1239
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,520
And then it came out.

1240
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,520
I don't know.

1241
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,520
Well, the way a Christina was actually, uh, conceived.

1242
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,520
He said, in such a horrible way.

1243
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,520
And then I'm the cover.

1244
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,520
Wait a minute.

1245
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,520
What did I do?

1246
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,520
Well, what did I do?

1247
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,520
How?

1248
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,520
I said he's with Christmas.

1249
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,520
And he made a horrible sort of terrible line.

1250
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,520
You know, remember that?

1251
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,520
And that line was on the cover.

1252
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,520
Uh, just above Christina's head.

1253
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,520
Who was having, like, shag on Christmas.

1254
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,520
Created this.

1255
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,520
Something like that was really, really.

1256
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,520
You don't say that, especially above.

1257
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,520
Well, there you go.

1258
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,520
He doesn't understand what you ever know.

1259
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,520
No.

1260
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,520
He has no, if it's about Christina, he has no feeling.

1261
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,520
He has no idea about family life.

1262
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,520
Oh, my God.

1263
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,520
About family fail use.

1264
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,520
And that's how I know him.

1265
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,520
Right.

1266
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,520
And so you're pointing at me is freaking me out.

1267
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,520
And I called in and I said, why is that on the cover?

1268
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,520
And why did you pick that line and put that above my, my daughter's head?

1269
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,520
And, and he said, well, that's that, that is not my job.

1270
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,520
I didn't do that.

1271
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,520
It's got nothing to do with me.

1272
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,520
Oh, what an ass.

1273
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,520
And he was very nasty.

1274
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,520
And I started to cry.

1275
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,520
I was so disappointed.

1276
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,520
I don't remember that.

1277
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,520
I felt, I was in.

1278
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,520
Did you tell me that?

1279
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,520
If you told me that, I would have kicked his fucking ass.

1280
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,520
You didn't tell me that.

1281
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,520
I was in the studio with, uh, ho for the rose.

1282
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,520
He still knows that.

1283
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,520
Did you tell me that?

1284
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,520
Well, and I cried because I felt so.

1285
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,520
You humiliated.

1286
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,520
Yeah.

1287
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,520
Yeah.

1288
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,520
And I felt stupid that I fell for it.

1289
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,520
And, uh, so maybe he's just a mean nasty guy.

1290
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,520
No.

1291
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:36,520
So, um, that was the last thing I spoken to these years and years.

1292
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,520
It is about, uh, maybe 17 years.

1293
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,520
Yeah.

1294
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,520
What'd you said?

1295
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,520
18 years ago.

1296
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,520
So Christina wasn't born.

1297
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,520
That's not possible.

1298
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,520
She's only 15.

1299
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,520
So I couldn't have been that long.

1300
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,520
I think it must have been 12 years ago.

1301
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,520
12 years ago.

1302
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,520
12 years ago.

1303
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,520
Okay, that's it.

1304
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,520
Let's just play a song and then we'll get back to us.

1305
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,520
Let's just regroup for a song.

1306
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,520
And I never talked to him again.

1307
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,520
That was it.

1308
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,520
Should we wrap this up?

1309
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,520
Play a song and then we'll wrap it all up?

1310
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,520
Yeah.

1311
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,520
Or do you want to, or do you want to continue?

1312
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,520
Depends on?

1313
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,520
What do you guys listening want?

1314
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,520
What?

1315
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,520
I'm asking the listeners what they want.

1316
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,520
Oh, what they want.

1317
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,520
They're like, don't play another fucking shitty song from your

1318
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,520
Dampod Podsate music network.

1319
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,520
Yeah.

1320
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,520
What?

1321
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,520
But you'd like this one, huh?

1322
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,520
Have you asked Rock Chick?

1323
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,520
She'll like it.

1324
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,520
Hey, hey sister.

1325
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,520
Laura Clap.

1326
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,520
Hey, the moment that I knew

1327
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,520
I'm over half the screen

1328
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,520
Just sent a bad decision

1329
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,520
I'm home.

1330
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,520
Quick to anticipate

1331
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,520
Which body punch do you need

1332
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:47,520
It's while she puts her fake eyelashes on

1333
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,520
Every morning say,

1334
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,520
Reaction

1335
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,520
Have soon, I'm sad,

1336
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,520
It's fashion.

1337
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,520
Hey, hey sister,

1338
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,520
You can let your head down

1339
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,520
You ain't done nothing bad

1340
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,520
And nothing up to feel so guilty

1341
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,520
You're just the partner

1342
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,520
Of the world and the rush

1343
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,520
This crazy life will be the end

1344
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,520
It's all a part of the way

1345
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,520
Up.

1346
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,520
She's under self attack

1347
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,520
Can't do this, can't do that

1348
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,520
Or she might lose her precious hands

1349
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,520
Watch your figure, watch your weight

1350
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,520
Clean out that empty blade

1351
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,520
Throw you know that ain't no way to live

1352
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:55,520
Time for social intervention

1353
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,520
Listen girl, pay close attention

1354
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,520
Hey, hey sister,

1355
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,520
You can let your head down

1356
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,520
You ain't done nothing bad

1357
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,520
And nothing up to feel so guilty

1358
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,520
You're just the partner

1359
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,520
Of the world and the rush

1360
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,520
This crazy life will be the end

1361
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,520
It's all a part of the way

1362
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:41,520
Up.

1363
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,520
She's under self attack

1364
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,520
You ain't done nothing bad

1365
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,520
And nothing up to feel so guilty

1366
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,520
You're just the partner

00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,520
This crazy life will be the end

1369
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,520
It's all a part of the way

1370
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,520
Up.

1371
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,520
She's under self attack

1372
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,520
You're just the partner

1373
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,520
Of the world and the rush

1374
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,520
This crazy life will be the end

1375
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,520
It's all a part of the way

1376
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,520
Up.

1377
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,520
She's under self attack

1378
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,520
You're just the partner

1379
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,520

It's all a part of the way

00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,520
Up.

1383
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,520
Crazy life will be the end

1384
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,520
It's all a part of the way

1385
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,520
Up.

1386
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,520
She's under self attack

1387
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,520
Up.

1388
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,520
She's under self attack

1389
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,520
Up.

1390
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,520
Up.

1391
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,520
Up.

1392
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,520
Up.

1393
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,520
Up.

1394
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,520
Up.

1395
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,520
To get kept in the trap

1396
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,520
Up.

1397
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,520
Up.

1398
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,520
With up.

1399
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,020
Up.

1400
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:42,520
Up.

1401
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,520
Up.

1402
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,520
Up.

1403
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,520
Up.

1404
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,520
Up.

1405
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,520
Up.

1406
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,520
Up.

1407
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,520
Up.

1408
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,520
Up.

1409
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,520
Up.

1410
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,520
Up.

1411
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,520
Up.

1412
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,520
Up.

1413
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,520
Up.

1414
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,520
Up.

1415
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,520
That's like the sheets in your ass.

1416
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,520
Oh my god.

1417
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,520
You know, this would, I'm so sorry.

1418
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,520
This would be very good song for Charlotte Church.

1419
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,520
Right.

1420
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,520
Oh, right on.

1421
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,520
Yeah, but she pulls it off, man.

1422
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,520
I mean, she sings it well, but.

1423
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,520
But screw it.

1424
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,520
Charlotte Church has nothing on this.

1425
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,520
No, but she could.

1426
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,520
No, no.

1427
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,520
Look, she's cute.

1428
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,520
Look.

1429
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,520
I know.

1430
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,520
But if she wants to sell the song.

1431
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,520
I like her.

1432
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,520
She looks badass.

1433
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,520
Charlotte is chunky.

1434
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,520
I know.

1435
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,520
I don't care.

1436
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,520
So what do you think Laura should give the song to the chunker?

1437
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,520
Look at her, man.

1438
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,520
She's great.

1439
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,520
That's all I say.

1440
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,520
That's old school.

1441
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,520
We are pod safe here.

1442
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,520
And we support the artists.

1443
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,520
Yes.

1444
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,520
And their careers.

1445
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,520
We don't need no stink and mainstream.

1446
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,520
Charlotte, chunky church.

1447
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,520
But she's not the England issue.

1448
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,520
That's what I'm saying.

1449
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,520
I'm bringing Laura Clapper.

1450
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,520
If she wants to sell, you know, if I put Laura Clapper on Jonathan Ross,

1451
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,520
Man, immediate overnight.

1452
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,520
Nobody knows her.

1453
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,520
So you wouldn't have to.

1454
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,520
I mean, to get on the show.

1455
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,520
Yes.

1456
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,520
To get on the show.

1457
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,520
Okay.

1458
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,520
But I got contacts.

1459
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,520
I'm connected, baby.

1460
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,520
You're talking about it.

1461
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,520
Okay.

1462
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,520
But she's great.

1463
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,520
True.

1464
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,520
Wonderful.

1465
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,520
And what a song.

1466
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,520
Let me just see if she wrote it on the show.

1467
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,520
I think she did.

1468
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,520
Let me say music.

1469
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,520
If she wrote it herself.

1470
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,520
Whoa.

1471
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,520
Oh.

1472
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,520
Hey.

1473
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,520
Sister.

1474
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,520
Shapo.

1475
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,520
I guess.

1476
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,520
What is simply?

1477
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,520
No.

1478
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,520
It doesn't say.

1479
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,520
Well, I mean, I don't have liner notes or anything here.

1480
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,520
Okay.

1481
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,520
She's got.

1482
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,520
Oh, man.

1483
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,520
Okay.

1484
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,520
Anyway.

1485
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,520
Very cool.

1486
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,520
You can find that the pot saved music network.

1487
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,520
I heard it on the pot show.

1488
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,520
Music rewind actually.

1489
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,520
That's where it's heard the song.

1490
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,520
It's a great place to pick up music.

1491
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,520
So to end the whole thing.

1492
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,520
Yes.

1493
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,520
To wind it all up.

1494
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,520
Somehow we pissed this guy off.

1495
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,520
Yeah.

1496
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,520
This guy.

1497
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,520
I don't know.

1498
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,520
I'm going to have to make him cry.

1499
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,520
Yeah.

1500
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,520
I have to make him cry.

1501
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,520
That was so disappointed.

1502
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,520
So I can cry.

1503
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,520
So stupid to fall for it.

1504
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,520
But anyway, after that,

1505
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,520
I actually never talk to him again.

1506
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,520
Because that's what I do.

1507
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,520
If I'm disappointed.

1508
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,520
Oh, well.

1509
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,520
He's just trying to get your attention.

1510
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,520
No, no, no, no, no.

1511
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,520
He doesn't.

1512
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,520
You know that.

1513
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:20,520
You know there's a whole different side on this whole story.

1514
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,520
And he just hates us.

1515
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,520
And he uses his magazine.

1516
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,520
You know, to get back to us.

1517
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,520
Or into irritators.

1518
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,520
That's all.

1519
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,520
Right.

1520
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,520
And which is fine.

1521
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,520
Because we've got podcasts.

1522
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,520
We've got all kinds of ways to do that.

1523
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,520
By the way, I don't spend a lot of time doing.

1524
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,520
Because we have other fish to fry.

1525
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,520
But that's fine.

1526
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,520
You can do whatever you want.

1527
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,520
But he can't break the law.

1528
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,520
And you know.

1529
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,520
And let me just tell you, wouldn't it be funny if the judge says,

1530
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,520
Well, it was confusing.

1531
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,520
I mean, this is a Yahoo company.

1532
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,520
I mean, this would be big fucking news

1533
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,520
if the creative comments doesn't stick.

1534
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,520
I have to get that.

1535
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,520
Well, she can be legendary.

1536
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,520
She can be legendary by saying, you know what?

1537
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,520
This shit has to stop and it's important that we send out a message.

1538
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,520
And we, and we listen, we do it.

1539
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,520
We do it.

1540
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,520
If we're Warner Brothers records.

1541
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,520
We do it.

1542
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,520
If we're, we're universal pictures.

1543
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,520
We do it.

1544
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,520
If we're Microsoft.

1545
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,520
Yeah.

1546
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,520
But what if those guys do it to us?

1547
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,520
Then all of a sudden they can, they can get away with it for just a pay off.

1548
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,520
No, no, no, no, no.

1549
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,520
This, this is a legendary case.

1550
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,520
Legendary.

1551
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,520
If she does it, this could set big, big jurisprudence.

1552
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,520
And Europe, at least.

1553
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,520
Now it would be really important.

1554
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,520
Seriously.

1555
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,520
Let's make a picket line outside the point.

1556
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,520
Okay.

1557
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,520
Why don't you go start hammering the signs.

1558
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,520
You start drawing them and I'll hammer up the wood.

1559
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,520
Hey, baby.

1560
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,520
Thanks for coming on the show.

1561
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,520
I love it so much when you're on the show.

1562
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,520
Thank you.

1563
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,520
Yes, today.

1564
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,520
You did a good job.

1565
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,520
Oh, well, it's my pleasure.

1566
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,520
That's my pleasure.

1567
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,520
That's my pleasure.

1568
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,520
Because it's big too much.

1569
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,520
Fuck it.

1570
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,520
That's not for, that's his man's job.

1571
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,520
Men gotta go out.

1572
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,520
It's like, you know.

1573
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,520
It's not good for my heart.

1574
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,520
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1575
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,520
Not good at all.

1576
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,520
No, I mean, it's a pain in the ass, but I do with a great pleasure.

1577
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,520
Because I gotta defend you guys somewhere.

1578
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,520
And I have to defend.

1579
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:02,520
I have to defend intellectual property across the vast internet.

1580
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,520
Well, everybody.

1581
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,520
God bless the internet.

1582
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,520
And the freedom for which it represents.

1583
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,520
It stands or something like that.

1584
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,520
I gotta work on the speech.

1585
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,520
Okay.

1586
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,520
I love not.

1587
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,520
Okay.

1588
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,520
I need a break now.

1589
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,520
Yeah, no.

1590
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,520
Okay.

1591
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,520
Let's have a cup of tea.

1592
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,520
Okay.

1593
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,520
I love you, baby.

1594
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,520
I love you too.

1595
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,520
Another pod show pod guest.

1596
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,520
Stick it in your ear.
