the curry condo. Hey, it's Friday, everybody. It's Fubar, which stands for fucked up beyond

141
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,680
all repair, at least it does on this show. And I want to welcome you all, but thank you

142
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,800
Brian. No, for pointing that one out. Those guys from Australia literally, it says it's a demo.

143
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,560
Now in their 11th year, they started at 13 years old in 1995. They won many national band

144
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,400
competitions, including the music Oz 2000 signed an international deal with Sony O2 released.

145
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:14,960
Sony O2 released their EP and oh, and Sony and O2, I got it released their EP in June 2004

146
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,000
gaining national airplay on radio and TV with you're on fire. No, hold on a second.

147
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,560
No, you're on fire isn't. Oh, wait. Is it on the podcast music network? Let me see.

148
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,760
They got a whole bunch and they're all title-like demo. Okay, so they don't have that one up there.

149
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:35,120
Great. Love it. And they've got an album coming out in early 2007. Can't wait to hear from these guys.

150
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:42,560
I think that their stuff is absolutely kick-ass. So it's the last show for this trip out to

151
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,840
California to pod show HQ. Because I won't be back for probably about a month, which is

152
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,840
obviously longer than I'd like it to be, but we've got the holidays coming up. And of course,

153
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,720
the first two weeks of January, we are moving house, as they say, in the UK. We're moving from the

154
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,200
What are we moving from the east side of Gilford? No, the west side of Gilford to the east.

155
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,400
Let me just check again. No, from the east side of Gilford to the west side of Gilford.

156
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,200
So that's going to take a couple of days to get settled in, get everything working. And you know

157
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,840
what's going to happen, even though I've already requested all the changes of services, you know that

158
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,400
the bandwidth will be fucked up. The satellite won't work. The telephone won't be connected.

159
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,720
And all of that amidst a celebrity birthday coming up, folks.

160
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,920
You know, we will live soon. Oh, hell, screw that. Hey, Adam, it's Brian. I just want to let you know

161
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,600
that the Jesus interview part one is available right now. And part two will be up in the next couple

162
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,360
days. So if you're interested in what the man has to say, you can find out for yourself,

163
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,880
attitude.podshow.com. Thanks. Can't wait. I see that it's up. So I'll definitely go and check it out.

164
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,880
And we'd love to hear from more you folks out there.

165
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,760
Yeah, it really is quite interesting how I'm getting so many calls from the UK these days. So I want to kick it off with

166
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,760
that U.S. voice number.

167
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,720
It's still easier for me to remember the U.S. one. All right. So we're going to scam the scam.

168
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,200
We're going to scan the voicemail box. You know, I had two beers last night.

169
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,040
That's why I'm all discombobulated. Two whole beers. You know what that does to me, right?

170
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:59,680
Scott Sigler had a quick little drink with him in between meetings. Literally. We were all in a meeting.

171
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,080
I guess the guys are going to meet up with Scott at 21st Amendment, which is right across from

172
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,880
our office building here at San Francisco. 21st Amendment is a bar, obviously. We then moved down to

173
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:15,920
Nova since 20 to 21st was filled to the brim. And you know, so we had a drink at like 530.

174
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,640
Then I went back and then we finished some more meetings that we were doing. I got to see Scott. We're

175
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,960
going to do some crazy ass things with him in 2007 with everybody. We're going through this big, huge,

176
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,760
would you go? We're getting our shit together. That's what I want to say. We're finally getting

177
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,600
our shit together. We're going to start figuring some stuff out. I think. Let's make 2007 the year

178
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:46,240
we get our shit together, shall we? I don't know. It's Andrew Terrylessness from up there Oxford

179
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,760
in the UK. Just listening to the last year, we were mentioning that in the new year,

180
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,960
you're going to kick off flying tools. I really think you need to rethink a title. And I was thinking

181
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:05,440
AC's high, given just in our so many levels, and AC's high AC's high to get it. I'll get my coat.

182
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,080
Okay. I don't know about that. So this is the show that I want to do in 2007, the video show.

183
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:19,280
I like flying tools because we're all fools in aviation, mainly because most people burn

184
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:25,520
all their money in the air when they're in aviation. AC high. I understand when you're coming from

185
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,920
not, you know, AC's high. Got to think about it. Open to more suggestions. Hey, who's that? He's

186
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:42,480
you're on a black and black emotion to rock this mother out. You're on a piece. Don't bend

187
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:52,720
that girl. It drives cowbell out. And let's all give a dive to the heart of work in the

188
00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:03,280
room. You're just in time. Yeah. What's up, Adam? It's Jersey Todd. The official music

189
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,880
college of the Chacha. And today, today I've got something very special for you. And that's an

190
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,120
exclusive for the Jersey Todd show in the Daily Source Code. From the album 13 from Surf Dog Records,

191
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,720
I'm bringing you one of the true innovators of the music scene today, Mr. Brian Settler. And when I

192
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,360
love about this song that I'm going to play for you, we are the mortars. It just sums up podcasting.

193
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,600
I mean, check out these lyrics. This is Brian Settler on the DCSC. Talk to you later. But he

194
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,800
happy holidays.

195
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,600
The big television star, we are the Russ.

196
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
It's nothing, no one taught us.

197
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
The girl of Pennsylvania, man.

198
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
The stick of shovel riding your hand.

199
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
We've got this music in our soul.

200
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
It's nothing to care here on the radio.

201
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
If you don't get it, that's your tough luck.

202
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
We don't care about making a book.

203
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,600
We're the boys that are here to ride.

204
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
We are the Russ.

205
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
We are the Russ.

206
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
We'll never obey your orders.

207
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
All right, now they think you're a fool.

208
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,600
But next year they'll be following cues.

209
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,600
We'll don't find the official life.

210
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,600
If you don't like the story,

211
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
let me one more roll and ride.

212
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
I said, five, you want more roll and ride.

213
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Come on, five, you want more roll and ride.

214
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
We are the Russ.

215
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Let this one roll and ride.

216
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
You got it to what you want to do.

217
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
You got it to what you want to do.

218
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
You got it to what you want to do.

219
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
But this roll and ride is way too short.

220
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Feel free to you, well there's a star.

221
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
That's all right.

222
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Thank you very much, Jersey Todd.

223
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Happy holidays to you as well, my friend.

224
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Good to hear that.

225
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
That's not on the podcast music network yet.

226
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
But I hope it will be shown up pretty soon.

227
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
By the way, most of the songs you hear on this program,

228
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
can be found at podshow.com slash music.

229
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Or in the show notes, a daily source code.com.

230
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Let me see, I wrote down a couple of things.

231
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
A couple of notes for today's show.

232
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,600
See, got some feedback here from Luke from the helm.

233
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
That's interesting.

234
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
I'm going to ask you a question about no keys.

235
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
How did you manage to get your podshow on the go channel

236
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
into the nokey of podcasting application?

237
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Yes.

238
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Is this something anyone can use?

239
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,600
You could even put it in your iTunes or any other type of podcast

240
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,600
you have created channel at podshow plus.

241
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,600
If you create an account, you automatically have a channel

242
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
that's named after yourself.

243
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
So you can use that one or create a new one if you want.

244
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
So if you're going to use the one that you already have,

245
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
first, add a show to it.

246
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
There's instructions there.

247
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,600
And so if you already have a channel, go just click on the channel name

248
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
and open up a little edit box.

249
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,600
And right there, you can choose how you want to enjoy your channel.

250
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
So that could be in the dashboard, which is the default.

251
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Or you could set it to iTunes.

252
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,600
And if you say that, iTunes is going to open.

253
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,600
And it's going to automatically subscribe you to your channel.

254
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Which, of course, will synchronize up

255
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
right up to your iPod.

256
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,600
There's also, I don't like the name yet.

257
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
It's, we call it what we call raw XML,

258
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,600
which I think is the wrong way to title that.

259
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,600
In fact, we probably should have a whole fucking list of stuff.

260
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
Like, you're Nokia phone.

261
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
So anyway, if you do raw XML, it'll give you the URL.

262
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,600
And you just copy that and you put that right at,

263
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,600
you use that to subscribe in your Nokia application

264
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,600
just say add podcast under that the top menu.

265
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
So that should work.

266
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,600
Maybe we should do a, can someone do a screen, a screen cast of that?

267
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
That'll be pretty cool.

268
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Because it really is awesome.

269
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,600
When you can control, see that the Nokia app,

270
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,600
in fact, as Luke said, let me just see where the hell was this.

271
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
There, I lose it already.

272
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
What the hell was that?

273
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Oh, here it is.

274
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Here we go.

275
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,600
I found the application a bit slow on my Nokia N80.

276
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,600
But I think that's due to I'm writing to the one gig,

277
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
a gig memory card.

278
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
Hmm.

279
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Now, I mean, all these, the phones, of course, are not as fast as computers

280
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,600
because they just don't have processors that are that fast.

281
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,600
So that's why I like managing just one channel.

282
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,600
Well, I have a couple, but really managing my channels on my Nokia

283
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
from any web browser.

284
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,600
You see how that stuff starts to, starts to work, starts to make sense.

285
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,600
So I can, if I don't want to have a certain show on my daily commute,

286
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,600
like I have a daily commute on my daily commute to the office in London.

287
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Then I just remove it from the channel.

288
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,600
There's no bullshit on the phone.

289
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,600
And the phone is automatically synced up, or any other device that I have

290
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
subscribed to that channel.

291
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Ah, this is one of those typical ones, Alistair Janks.

292
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Researchers in New Zealand have proven that there is a link between cannabis

293
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
and mental illness.

294
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Oh, yes.

295
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Well, let's see what the story says.

296
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,600
I don't know if the bandwidth at the condo is just slow today,

297
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,600
or it seems like things are just going a little slow.

298
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
I'll screw it.

299
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
I'm not going to wait for that.

300
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
That's going to take too long.

301
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Oh, crap.

302
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,600
There's one thing I don't like about that Google notebook.

303
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,600
If you use that at all, is that unlike everything else the Google

304
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,600
does, when you click on a link, instead of opening up a new tab or

305
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,600
a new browser window, you can set that in your browser.

306
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Of course, what it does is it just goes to the page.

307
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,600
So you lose the page that had your notes on it.

308
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,600
And Google doesn't behave this way in Google reader or in Gmail or in

309
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
calendar or anything.

310
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Anything with a link and external link pops open on new tabs.

311
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
I don't understand why they do that in this.

312
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Anyway, so I guess that's true.

313
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,600
There's some sure there's a link between mental illness and cannabis.

314
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Just in time for the holidays, there's podshow music rewind.

315
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Episode number 50 is out.

316
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,600
I haven't heard it yet, but I saw it come through in my channel today.

317
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
The best of rewind.

318
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Look back at 15 of the most memorable podcasters who have appeared on

319
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
the show.

320
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Marcus Couds doing his thing, of course, great.

321
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Hi, Adam, it's David Cohen.

322
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
One of your YouTube listeners here.

323
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Can you give me a favor?

324
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,600
The whole Giselle thing is getting kind of old now.

325
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Can you on one of the next episodes?

326
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Just ask them to ring in and give you whatever it is they're promoting.

327
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,600
Obviously they're promoting some sort of podcasters or something like that.

328
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,600
The whole thing sounds really fake now and it's getting kind of old.

329
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,600
So can you just get them to tick their hat and just find out what's going on.

330
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,600
So we can all find out and move on from it.

331
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
That'll be good.

332
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Thanks very much, bye.

333
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Interesting.

334
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,600
I talked about this with Scott Sigler last night and he said,

335
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Wow, the drama of that shit is unbelievable.

336
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,600
He's like, I don't really know if it's real or not.

337
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,600
We went through that yesterday and there was some analyzing that,

338
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,600
forget it at someone, look at the waveforms and the CSIDSC lab and

339
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,600
determined that the messages we've been getting from Nick,

340
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
who says the Giselle has gone missing for four days.

341
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,600
R&D, the same voice that sent in this message.

342
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,600
I don't know who this is but stop fucking calling Giselle at all.

343
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,600
And I don't, I don't know.

344
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,600
I'm going to, I'm still going to take it pretty seriously.

345
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,600
And if there's, if there is indeed some kind of big payoff and there's some,

346
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
this is some kind of big joke and I agree,

347
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
you should probably get it over with pretty soon.

348
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Although I do appreciate the way all of you are treating it.

349
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,600
First one, two, one, six, five, six, three, five, seven.

350
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,600
But stop fucking calling the Giselle at seven.

351
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,600
And we're reaching across international boundaries.

352
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
They need to be events.

353
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
My couple of them at Bell and I can chill.

354
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Punna cook.

355
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Punna cook.

356
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
And this is now for me and R&D.

357
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
I have a couple of questions.

358
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
What if I happen to be in a metro station?

359
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
I really like that segment.

360
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
You mean the metro sectional moment?

361
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Yeah, I haven't done one of those in a long time.

362
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
I don't know.

363
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,600
I guess I just didn't have the inspiration after I told you guys,

364
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,600
you know, how I remove hair and how I shave.

365
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Yeah, how I smell nice.

366
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
I didn't have much left to say.

367
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
That's how I had a question.

368
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,600
I was really wondering if anybody has found a really like after surely has like an

369
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,600
SPF, like a 15 or something because I'm really looking for something like that.

370
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Or I hate the punna book.

371
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,600
I think that's a good one.

372
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
I don't think you can actually do that.

373
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,600
I think the aftershave part is supposed to like clean out the wounds you've created.

374
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Fuck at home on the second.

375
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,600
Let me see if I can find it.

376
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
Here you go.

377
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
Okay.

378
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Hello Adam.

379
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
This is Mike Moss.

380
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Shit, that's not the one I was looking for.

381
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
I can't even find my metro.

382
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
It's been so long.

383
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Metro moment.

384
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Maybe that's one.

385
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Is this it?

386
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
No.

387
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
No.

388
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
That's just people calling for a metro sectional moment dude.

389
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Sorry.

390
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Can't find it.

391
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Can't find the music anymore.

392
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
It's been that long.

393
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
I don't think there is an aftershave.

394
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
With an SPF factor.

395
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,600
I think you have to go for a moisturizer.

396
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,600
What the hell am I doing?

397
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
First of all, moisturizer.

398
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
That's not too much.

399
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
I want to have one item.

400
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
That's where it's for me.

401
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Everything else.

402
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Whatever happens to it with a sun.

403
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
It's certainly when we say the way we know it goes in.

404
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,600
I don't really like that.

405
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
That was pretty sweet.

406
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,600
It made me feel special because I was into the podcast.

407
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
And I would go to the beach.

408
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Do what you know.

409
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,600
When I was being special.

410
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
Thanks a much back.

411
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
All right.

412
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Well, you want to feel special then?

413
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Okay.

414
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
Sit back.

415
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Put your hands by your side.

416
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
No.

417
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
No.

418
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
You seem like no.

419
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
There.

420
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
There you go.

421
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
Put them by your side.

422
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Okay.

423
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
That's right.

424
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
It's close.

425
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Everybody.

426
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
Because I'm just going the way.

427
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
He's here to repair your satellite.

428
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,600
The satellite repair man.

429
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Coming after you.

430
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
The satellite repair man.

431
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
What's he going to do?

432
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,600
He'll fix your miscene sessions.

433
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,600
And answer questions too.

434
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
You're nothing in the universe.

435
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
And you can't do for you.

436
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
The satellite repair man.

437
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Woo!

438
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
The satellite repair man.

439
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
Come on.

440
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
Come on.

441
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Come on.

442
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
Hey, Bonnie.

443
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Okay.

444
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
I've got a couple more minutes.

445
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,600
Just time enough to play something for you.

446
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
This was quite amazing.

447
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
You know, we've had.

448
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,600
And when I say, we, I mean, pod show UKBT pod show.

449
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
We've had ongoing conversations.

450
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,600
For quite a while.

451
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Because John Cleese does a podcast.

452
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,600
And it's an audio podcast, which I didn't care too much for his audio podcast.

453
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
But I'd like the idea of John Cleese.

454
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,600
And I think that's a very marketable media property, obviously.

455
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,600
And we could do something cool with his show.

456
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Certainly get a more attention than what he's been getting over the past 16 episodes.

457
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,600
But we really couldn't get it together with the guy who I guess he's.

458
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,600
I guess he's a, he's a, he has like a production company.

459
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,600
So I guess he records the audio and edits it and puts up the RSS feeds his guy.

460
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,600
Which turns out to be a dick, by the way, Dean Whitbread.

461
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,600
It's just not a nice guy.

462
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
I don't like him at all.

463
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,600
You know, he, what we just couldn't get anything together.

464
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,600
We couldn't actually even get to discussing the podcast.

465
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:42,600
So, you know, off the wall with with what he's thinking about and what he's doing.

466
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,600
And so this morning, and of course, I'm subscribed to the John Cleese podcast.

467
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,600
You can find it in a pod show plus just to use the search.

468
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
I'll put a link to it in the show notes.

469
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Search for John Cleese and you'll find it.

470
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,600
And so they finally came out with a video podcast.

471
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,600
And well, you know, I'm going to let you listen to the audio because I was really,

472
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,600
I mean, the, the production is great.

473
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,600
It's called an airline rant and, and it looks great.

474
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
But the, the jokes was just like shit.

475
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Okay.

476
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Listen in.

477
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,600
On airplanes, they announced the captain has switched on the seat belt sign.

478
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Are they mad?

479
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,600
The important words here are captains switched on and seat belt sign.

480
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:29,600
So, these stress, the word has only a reason to say the captain has switched on the seat belt sign.

481
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Is it all the passengers are just shouted out?

482
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Why hasn't the captains switched on the seat belt sign?

483
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,600
In which case was hostess of stewarders?

484
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
I'll plate the ten under one.

485
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
I mean, she's called this week.

486
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:45,600
Would be in sighting to say the captain has switched on the seat belt sign because she's contradicting them.

487
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,600
Similarly, the announcement, the plane will be landing in 20 minutes.

488
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,600
The important words here are plane landing and 20 minutes.

489
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,600
So they stress will only, if the passengers are coursing, the plane won't be landing in 20 minutes.

490
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,600
Then the plane will be landing in 20 minutes.

491
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Makes sense.

492
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,600
So, airlines, do something about it.

493
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
Will it?

494
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,600
You know, I'm a big John Klee's fan.

495
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
I love Monty Python.

496
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,600
And I'm just about anything those guys do.

497
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,600
But the airline jokes?

498
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,600
I mean, this has been done by a thousand comedians.

499
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:32,600
You know, George Carlin has a great routine about airlines and, you know, you get in the plane and not on the plane and pre-boarding.

500
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,600
So, I just don't understand how this is not funny.

501
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,600
It's not funny and it's old.

502
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
Really disappointed.

503
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
I don't understand how that happened.

504
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
Oh, well.

505
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,600
A serious satellite, one or two listeners, you were about to lose me.

506
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Too bad.

507
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
They already lost.

508
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Yeah, so that was, I was really surprised by that.

509
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,600
For all the hoopla, this Dean Guy was making.

510
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
I'd expect it a little bit more.

511
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
Anyway, I'll put a link in the show notes.

512
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
You can go check it out for yourself.

513
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
No!

514
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
The oldest thing to the daily source, Klee.

515
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Adam Klee.

516
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,600
The guy who is obviously handsome is filthy rich.

517
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,600
As a full head, our gorgeous, long hair has two gorgeous women in his life.

518
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Me, I'm G.D.

519
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,600
I'm old, fat, and bald.

520
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,600
With the perfect face for podcasting.

521
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,600
And if I try really hard, I could probably find two pennies to rub together.

522
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,600
But what I can bring you is 60 minutes of the best independent music five times a week.

523
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
That's right.

524
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Mindy food to Friday.

525
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
Direct from my home at Typhoid Towers.

526
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
I'm a tiny island off the North Wales coast.

527
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,600
I bring you G.D.s bite-sized bonus.

528
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,600
If you like good music, come on over to bite-sized bonus.pogshow.com

529
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,600
and listen to the Greatest Hits you've never heard.

530
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,600
That's bite-sized bonus.pogshow.com.

531
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,600
It's what your ears have been waiting for.

532
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
You'd better believe it.

533
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
Bite-sized bonus.

534
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Doing it to you.

535
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
5 day the week.

536
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,600
www.bite-sized bonus.pogshow.com.

537
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
Yeah!

538
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,600
The force is growing in the UK at btpodshow.com.

539
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,600
Welcome to the network.

540
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,600
I think we're supposed to have a holiday party on Friday.

541
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:14,600
So, obviously not today, but next Friday at the shortage office at the UK crash pad as we call it.

542
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,600
I hope that we'll be seeing some of the network podcasters show up as well.

543
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,600
I have no idea who's been invited.

544
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
It's so difficult, man.

545
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Let me tell you.

546
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,600
We've like 125 people coming tonight for the party in San Francisco.

547
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,600
And you know, parties are big word.

548
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,600
I think we're doing the right thing, actually.

549
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,600
You know, from 6 to 9, we're going to have food.

550
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
We're going to have some music.

551
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
We're going to have some fun.

552
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,600
And then, well, we have to organize the after party.

553
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Who's taking care of that, guys?

554
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Peter Cogel.

555
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
Ask Cogel.

556
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
Paul with a sea of Cogel.

557
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,600
He's a 16-year-old music freak.

558
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
Tract inside the 45-year-old spotty.

559
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,600
Weird and wonderful music.

560
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,600
It's fairly eclectic.

561
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
He's only just about anything.

562
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
If you like it, I'll play it.

563
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,600
From the latest indie rock, jazz, folk, and bandra.

564
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Twice a week at PC podcast.

565
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,600
Podger.com.

566
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Diversity, musical stars.

567
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Just brightening up someone's day.

568
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Yeah.

569
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,600
I also knew on the network this week as a new Dr. Cogney in West London.

570
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,600
Check that out, International Sex Therapist. podshow.com.

571
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,600
It's the URL you can never remember.

572
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,600
I just kind of beaty podger.com or a few.

573
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,600
I could go search for Dr. Cogney.

574
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,600
It's just a funny shit.

575
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,600
Let's see.

576
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,600
It was a new who's on it.

577
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,600
I don't know if that one's out yet with O.J.

578
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,600
And oh, a new in the attic with Rachel and Pete and the gang.

579
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
The fucking great episode.

580
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,600
And I'm really, I got to tell you.

581
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,600
At first, I really was guilty of making jokes about Rachel.

582
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,600
Rachel followers at Pete Townsend's girlfriend.

583
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,600
You know, significantly younger girlfriend.

584
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
I might add.

585
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,600
But the more I watch this show in the attic.

586
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,600
So it's in the attic. podshow.com.

587
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,600
The more I watch it, the more I'm really drawn to her.

588
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,600
She is an amazing woman.

589
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,600
She's fun. She's wacky.

590
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,600
I really love the wackiness.

591
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,600
She smokes.

592
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
I like that.

593
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,600
And she's sexy.

594
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,600
And she's very talented.

595
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,600
I really like her stuff.

596
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,600
Anyway, so I'm going to try and get her into the.

597
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
Into the shortage office.

598
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Maybe do a couple interviews and hang out.

599
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,600
But look at the next episode of in the attic.

600
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
At in the attic. podshow.com.

601
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,600
I think you'll agree that this is really some amazing shit.

602
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Okay, Marcus Couch sent me a cage nine song earlier in the week.

603
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,600
Because, of course, I'm sure responsible for getting these guys in the podsafe music network.

604
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,600
You can go to podshow.com slash music and find them.

605
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,600
The names are cage nine.

606
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,600
This is Hollywood Car Crash.

607
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,600

We'll see you in the next episode.

722
00:32:51,600 --> 00:33:03,600
Oh, yes, that's one talking about it's Friday...

723
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,600
...a.

724
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,600
That's right, we wind up another week at his rhubarb Friday, which means it's time for the final thought of the week.

725
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,600
And really, I've been thinking about a couple of people this week.

726
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:24,600
I just wanted to stop and thank for all of the work they've been doing, because as is typical with going today's world in general,

727
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:31,600
people really see what's on the outside. Now, this is kind of a metaphor, but you'll understand what I'm talking about.

728
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:39,600
They see the pretty pictures, the moving images, they see the things to, you know, to stroke and feel and click and lick.

729
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,600
But there's always something going on underneath under the hood.

730
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,600
Well, that's right, I'm talking about the engineers.

731
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,600
Now, for the past month or so, we've had a new guy in in a pod show.

732
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,600
I think I talked about him before his name is A.L. Shavid.

733
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:08,600
And together with the engineering team, these guys are really pulled off just such an amazing feat of really organizing this huge ball of the huge tar ball.

734
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,600
Let's call it that we call our platform.

735
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:20,600
And really when you look at the stuff that has to be done to create the infrastructure to make all of this stuff work, and you know, just take a look at it at podshow.com.

736
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,600
You can see that there's a lot of work that's going on that has been done.

737
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,600
And of course, there's still a lot of work to do.

738
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:31,600
But these, these ladies and gentlemen, truly are the unsung heroes pretty much of everything cool in our lives.

739
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:38,600
Everything, you know, whenever you flip on the television, whenever you use the dishwasher, whenever you listen to a podcast or make a podcast,

740
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:47,600
there's a whole bunch of people that you probably will never know about never will meet, probably will ever even think about who make all that possible.

741
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,600
And let me tell you, writing code, it's like painting.

742
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
It's like writing a book.

743
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,600
It's like, you know, any other type of creative activity.

744
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,600
It can be done in a million different ways.

745
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
You can get from here to there.

746
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,600
It's just an infinitesimal amount of ways.

747
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:10,600
So it's creative and I just really wanted to stop and say that I do think about that because, well, I signed your paychecks.

748
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,600
I think fuck what these guys do.

749
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,600
That's, it really is great.

750
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:24,600
So for this holiday season, I want to toast all the engineers and developers in the world because they just don't get enough props.

751
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:39,600
I just wanted to play one last song, which is, I don't think it's a gone pod safe or that it's up.

752
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,600
Of course, the song itself is pretty much one of the oldest songs in the book.

753
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:55,600
If you have not seen the podcast for Bolivian Bolivian Bolivian Bolivian, Bolivian Rapcity, this is a video show you've got to check out.

754
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:01,600
It's a crew who went to or in Bolivia or went to Bolivia.

755
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,600
I think they might, they just got back from from a trip.

756
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:11,600
And the whole trip is for, for a good cause, it's for a charity called Sikhism in Bolivia.

757
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:21,560
It's a charity foundation, and what their goal is is to improve education for children,

758
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:27,560
obviously, children's education in Bolivia, and the pictures, and it's really focused

759
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:34,120
around music, and certainly these first things like two episodes up, and the first

760
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:40,080
of the country, the people, it's so beautiful, and you just, yeah, it's so well done, and

761
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:47,200
shot in the wide screen. I don't know if it's HD, maybe it's even HD. But they're kind

762
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,720
of mixing and mashing it up, and so there's a very popular song, which I'm going to play

763
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,480
for you. There's a video for it. I don't know if this video is available yet. I hope we

764
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,000
can make it available because I really want you to see the video clip. If it's not in

765
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,920
the episode, I just haven't had time to look at the episode, but I saw the clip and

766
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:09,240
like I got to share the song with you. So as a Dutch guy on piano, shit was his name. Was it

767
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:16,160
Mike? I think. And a Bolivian songstress, and just imagine the setting here for a second

768
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:24,960
if you will. It's a grand piano, there's candles, you know, it's kind of got that nice, soft

769
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:32,560
glow over it, and I'm sure you'll recognize the song just in time for the holidays, where

770
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:39,560
in the world children all have equal education and love throughout the land.

771
00:38:32,560 --> 00:39:02,560
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let

772
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:32,560

773
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:41,560
let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let'm go, let's go,

774
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:45,280
I don't stick that in your pipe, smoke it, will you?

775
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,000
Damn, that's great.

776
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,520
All played live.

777
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,720
I'll look in the, just before I upload the show,

778
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,840
I'll see if we wish you all the Merry Christmas

779
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,960
