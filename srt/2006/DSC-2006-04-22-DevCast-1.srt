00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Well, hello, everybody.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Welcome to the very first Devcast.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Which you can find and hopefully,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Did find at developers.podshow.com.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
With me, I'm in Gilford in the Curry Cottage with me today.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Joining us via Skype is Andrew Grommett,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
who is at Pod Show HQ in San Francisco,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Morning Andrew.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Good morning, Adam.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So, here we go, bro.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We're getting real close now.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Getting real.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So, excuse me, I'm eating a cheese and grapes.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Which is a rocket fuel for developers in England.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's not a diet coke.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
No, no, no, no, no.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I don't drink diet coke.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay, so here's the concept.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We want to allow the first audience members to come into Pod Show

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Plus and, you know, snoop around and see what's going on

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and work with the podcast delivery network as well.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And since we have lots of cool stuff that we already planning for developers,

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
we thought it was a logical,

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
yeah, really a logical step to say,

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
well, why don't we let the developers in first?

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Who, of course, are fantastic listeners.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Andrew is you and I, or as I know, having worked with you.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I mean, those early days of, of podcasting when,

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
literally, you know, I'd create a show and then you guys would adapt your code.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You know, what was it like from your end,

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
back in the day, developing with, with users who were creating podcasts?

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It was pretty amazing.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The thing, it's, it's, uh,

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
when you can build your own code and then,

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
have that, you know, influence your daily life, build the tools that are,

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
you know, improving your, your data day experience.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's, that's one of the best things you can do,

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I think, uh, as an engineer.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Maybe just short of building stuff for other people,

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
which, of course, we were doing it the same time.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But, uh, I do have a great memory of the first.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't know if you remember this,

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
you remember the first.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I think you played a clip from a coverville of the Abba.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Um, do you remember this?

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
They did Abba covers in the early days.

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Trying to think, I don't know.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I just have this incredible memory of, of walking down the street,

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and listening to this cover of an Abba song,

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
uh, and thinking, wow, okay, we're really onto something here.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Um, yeah.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Covers of Abba, we've really improved the universe.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Haven't we, Andrew?

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's great.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Now, we've had, um,

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
developer.podshow.com up for a while.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Um, we actually haven't really been able to add much to it.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Since we haven't really opened up yet,

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and I guess, uh, we're working to happen here.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We'll eventually flow over into, uh, into that site.

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, right on.

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's, uh, where we're collecting all of the, uh, ideas.

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Right now, of course, it's heavy on ideas.

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But, uh, as we release SDKs,

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
we will have, um, you know, downloads and web visible,

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
the HTML documentation for everything that we release,

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
uh, trying to make it really easy.

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Collect code examples, um,

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
uh, pointers to, uh,

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
people who might have put things up on their own sites.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Just try to make it, uh,

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
you know, the place to get started,

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
if you're a developer and want to build something around the PDN.

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Right.

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Now, there's, there's really two sides.

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
There is the PDN.

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The podcast will be network and actually, uh,

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
there isn't API for that now, which, uh,

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
is pretty standard.

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't think we've published it yet,

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and so we can get to it.

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But, uh, we're going to publish that

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
for these developers as well, who will be playing with that?

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Absolutely.

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah.

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So, um, I've actually, uh,

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
there's a couple of the recent posts sort of hint at where we're going,

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and, um, actually, I made you,

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
maybe that maybe I should do a dev cast to actually talk

95
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
through some of the stuff we, uh,

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
you know, figure it out, uh,

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
doing some of that implementation, um,

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
uh, as a, you know, a way to,

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
test the water and see what people's reactions are.

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Uh, before, you know, what happens when you commit things,

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
too, uh, writing on the web suddenly,

102
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
they become stack.

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah.

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Before, you know, even if you say,

105
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
even if you say, this is not stack,

106
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
so maybe a podcast is the way to, uh,

107
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
uh, you know, put some ideas out there for feedback.

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Excellent.

109
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Well, yeah, that would be good,

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and then we'll just include it in this feed as well.

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And then we have a pod show plus.

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And this is where I think there's a lot of exciting stuff

113
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
to be done as well.

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This is really the, the experience side.

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This is what we built for the audience.

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This is what really is taking the most time.

117
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
To really get it right.

118
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And we have a concept of modules.

119
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You want to get into that a little bit and explain what that is and,

120
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and how they work and how the developers are mess around with them.

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah.

122
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Absolutely.

123
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Modules are segments of every user and show on the on pod show plus

124
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
will have a page.

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We're calling it a profile page where you can, you know,

126
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
sort of like a homepage, uh,

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
where you can, uh,

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
uh, view information, uh,

129
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
about a person or a show.

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And the person or the, you know,

131
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
if it's a show maintainer,

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
they arrange content on that page,

133
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
sort of like a blog page,

134
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
um, or a sort of a my,

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
you know,

136
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yahoo type page.

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And what we'll be doing with modules is,

138
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
um,

139
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
modules just our name for different areas on the page,

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
um,

141
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
that you can fill with flicker feeds or,

142
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
you know, any RSS feed or,

143
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
yeah,

144
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
who weather or, um,

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
you know,

146
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
recent shows from the,

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
uh,

148
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm sorry,

149
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
recent, uh,

150
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
additions to the pod safe music network.

151
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So we've come up with a handful of modules,

152
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
uh, for people to put on their pages.

153
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And what we'll be doing is opening an up,

154
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
up in SDK that lets developers create,

155
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
uh, new modules that people can put on their pages.

156
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So, uh,

157
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
that, you know,

158
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
within kind of reasonable limits of security and,

159
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and machine, you know,

160
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
resource use,

161
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
you'll be able to put pretty much anything on your page that you want.

162
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So, uh,

163
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
we'll make it, uh,

164
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
you know,

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
you know,

166
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
let a thousand flowers bloom,

167
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
as they say,

168
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
you know,

169
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
let's see what people come up with.

170
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah, we will actually have,

171
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
uh,

172
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
almost a user version of that,

173
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
which, of course,

174
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
a module that eats HTML.

175
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You can, you know,

176
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
jam any HTML in there,

177
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
which users have gotten pretty good at.

178
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And you'll be able to put that on your page as well.

179
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So, it's,

180
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
it's kind of hard to explain.

181
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So, that's why, you know,

182
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm happy that now people are going to be able to come in and take a look at it.

183
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Um,

184
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
how are we actually going to manage the,

185
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
uh, this development process,

186
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Andrew, I mean,

187
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
who do people talk to,

188
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
uh,

189
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I know we don't,

190
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
we don't have everything set up yet with URLs,

191
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
etc.

192
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Obviously,

193
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
um,

194
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
we're not going to give them out on the public podcast.

195
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
How,

196
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
how will the feedback loop work,

197
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
is it going to be a CVS,

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
or what,

199
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
what have you set up for all that?

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah,

201
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
we're looking at,

202
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
actually right now,

203
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
we're looking at,

204
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
uh,

205
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
using a source forage project.

206
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Um,

207
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
we've talked internally about,

208
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
uh,

209
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
you know,

210
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
managing the CVS ourselves,

211
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
but, um,

212
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I think,

213
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
there's sort of,

214
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
this is a well understood,

215
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
you know,

216
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
problem set as long as people are developing open source stuff.

217
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We,

218
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
there's plenty of tools out there,

219
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
uh,

220
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
that we can,

221
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
you know,

222
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
so we can use for,

223
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
uh,

224
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
saving people's code.

225
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I mean,

226
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
the key thing is just that,

227
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
you know,

228
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and there's a place to point to it,

229
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and stuff doesn't fall through the cracks.

230
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Um,

231
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
but,

232
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
K1 and myself,

233
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Kevin Strausky,

234
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
will be,

235
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
in the points of contact.

236
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We actually have a,

237
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
a little used currently,

238
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
uh,

239
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Gmail address,

240
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
uh,

241
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
podshow developer at Gmail.com.

242
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So we'll either use that or,

243
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
or whatever tools are available on,

244
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
say source forage,

245
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
or,

246
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
you know,

247
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
wherever we host it.

248
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So now it,

249
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
it being on source force.

250
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That means we can keep it close.

251
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We can keep it password protected.

252
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Well,

253
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
that's a good point.

254
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Uh,

255
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
source forage is,

256
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
is for open source,

257
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
um,

258
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
you know,

259
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
code,

260
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
which I don't actually,

261
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
that's a good question.

262
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't think we've,

263
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
um,

264
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
technically if it's running on our servers,

265
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
we could keep it closed.

266
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But if you mean,

267
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
you know,

268
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
we need a password,

269
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
you know,

270
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
in order to commit code,

271
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
sure that's how source forage works.

272
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Um,

273
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
but the code itself up there would be out in the open.

274
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay.

275
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Well,

276
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
that's,

277
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
that's not,

278
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
that's not an issue.

279
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Well,

280
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and I think probably,

281
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
um,

282
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
and so we're going to issue golden tickets on these dev cast.

283
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So it could be that you'd hear in this show,

284
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
could be in the next show,

285
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
could be the one after that.

286
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But really,

287
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
the intention is to get all the developer's in,

288
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
but instead of having,

289
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
you know,

290
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
a couple hundred show up in,

291
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
in one day,

292
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
we're going to stagger it.

293
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So you'll hear in one of these dev cast,

294
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
you'll hear instructions on where to go.

295
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And I'm thinking that that makes sense,

296
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
that we give instructions,

297
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
or maybe there's a pre registered,

298
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
um,

299
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
that's a good,

300
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
that's an interesting one.

301
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We can give more.

302
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We're also going to have a wiki else that I mentioned,

303
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
as a place for information,

304
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and putting up code samples.

305
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah, my favorite technology.

306
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay.

307
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So instructions,

308
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
how to get into this particular developer program,

309
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
we'll be included in the golden ticket.

310
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And of course,

311
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
over the course of the next,

312
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't know,

313
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
we'll probably do five of these,

314
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and then as they go along as you and Kevin and other people have stuff to say,

315
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
we'll just do more,

316
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
which I think is kind of cool

317
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
if we have the audio feedback portion

318
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
to what's going on,

319
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
then eventually everyone will get in.

320
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Just so everyone is clear on the intent there.

321
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, I see.

322
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay, right.

323
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And Andrew,

324
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
by the way,

325
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
is the guy behind D-gap?

326
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
We can actually do this, right?

327
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

328
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So, well,

329
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
do you want me to talk about that?

330
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah, absolutely.

331
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
This is my favorite,

332
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
favorite stuff that we built.

333
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This is cool.

334
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay, so with D-gap,

335
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
we basically have a system where you can set up a flag that says,

336
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
you know,

337
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
the next episode that comes through on show X,

338
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
you know,

339
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
should be flagged to get an insertion.

340
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And then there's a pointer to,

341
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
you know,

342
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
the file that will be inserted.

343
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And as you recall,

344
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
we'd come up with a convention for passing the information into the system about,

345
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
where in the middle of the cast,

346
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
the insertion should be made and with what probability, right?

347
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
This was the coin toss idea with each downloader.

348
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We pick a random number and,

349
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
you know, subject to some probability,

350
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
decide whether that user will get a goal to take it.

351
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And then if they do,

352
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
we bump the counter and,

353
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
and, you know,

354
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
check to make sure that we're only serving these golden tickets up to a certain point.

355
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And after that,

356
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
we don't serve anymore.

357
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So we're eventually going to open up an API for that as well.

358
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I would presume.

359
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We definitely can, right?

360
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It, uh,

361
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
excuse me,

362
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
but all I'm saying all,

363
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
yeah,

364
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I had my own,

365
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
you know,

366
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I was thinking about that.

367
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You know,

368
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
we're not,

369
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
we need to get this in sale.

370
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Love here over HQ.

371
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Really.

372
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Um,

373
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
uh,

374
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
so we can APIize that absolutely.

375
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Um,

376
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I think the sky's the limit, really.

377
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Cool.

378
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We have to,

379
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
you know,

380
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
figure out what people like and,

381
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
you know,

382
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
okay.

383
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Um,

384
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
just,

385
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
oh, yeah,

386
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I wanted to touch briefly on,

387
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
because I,

388
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
in the source code,

389
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I said that,

390
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
really,

391
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
the only skills you need are knowledge of HTML,

392
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
PHP.

393
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Am I correct in that assumption?

394
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It doesn't seem like there's much more there, is there?

395
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yeah.

396
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's, uh,

397
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
there's actually,

398
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
a sort of build-up function that will set up a skeleton for you as well.

399
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So you don't even have to know the file structure,

400
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
all that deeply.

401
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Um,

402
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
but you give it a name for your module.

403
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And, uh,

404
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
it's sort of what the,

405
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
you know, a gentle slope.

406
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You can just put in some,

407
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
some static text and you're often running,

408
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
uh,

409
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
but what we'll do is we'll provide docs on,

410
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
you know,

411
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
how to get deeper and create custom variables and so forth.

412
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Excellent.

413
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So yeah,

414
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I don't think we,

415
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
we're not going to require any sequel programming or anything like that.

416
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Okay.

417
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Good, because then I can't participate.

418
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I want to get in there and mess around and screw some shit up.

419
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I know just enough to be really dangerous.

420
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I was going to say,

421
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
can you, you know,

422
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
tunnel out your,

423
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
your second life identity somehow.

424
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Dude,

425
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
that stuff is outrageous.

426
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Have you been,

427
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
but tried second life?

428
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I haven't.

429
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm scared of it.

430
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
If I do it,

431
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
that'll be it.

432
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It'll eat your time.

433
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It takes away your life.

434
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It, it,

435
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
it becomes first life almost.

436
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's amazing.

437
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I've already,

438
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
um,

439
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
someone already gave me a,

440
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
um, a penis.

441
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So I can use that now and all the,

442
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
you know,

443
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
the sex area is,

444
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
it's crazy.

445
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's like,

446
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
it's really nice.

447
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What did I hear that they're,

448
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
they're prostitutes now?

449
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh, yeah.

450
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Excuse me.

451
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Escorts Andrew.

452
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Escorts.

453
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Oh, sorry.

454
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
All right.

455
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
All right.

456
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Good man.

457
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So let's leave it at this.

458
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And tomorrow,

459
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I think I'll connect with,

460
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
uh,

461
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
with Kevin and, uh,

462
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
who walk us through,

463
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
uh,

464
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
some more of the module stuff.

465
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And as of tomorrow,

466
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
um,

467
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
hopefully we'll have it all set up so that we can,

468
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
uh,

469
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
and so this is this first one.

470
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'll just make sure that,

471
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
uh,

472
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
everyone is receiving it that,

473
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
uh,

474
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
we've got,

475
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
uh,

476
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
everyone is hooked up and subscribed.

477
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I think this probably going to be about,

478
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
30 to 40 people who will,

479
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
who are subscribed already.

480
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I mean,

481
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
it's, uh,

482
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
excellent.

483
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah.

484
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Now I'm looking forward to this.

485
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Because there's a lot of excitement on,

486
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
on the,

487
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
on the,

488
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
on the first post,

489
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
mainly because people are just waiting and waiting

490
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
and waiting for me to get my ass in care and get this stuff up.

491
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
All right,

492
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
um,

493
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
what's up for you today at HQ?

494
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And well,

495
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
uh,

496
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I've just about got the,

497
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
the wiki set up.

498
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I think I was mentioning that the,

499
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
um,

500
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
so this will be uh,

501
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
tied in with the pdn,

502
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
so that the login will carry over and,

503
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
um,

504
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
uh,

505
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
uh,

506
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
uh,

507
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
got a call with a big,

508
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
uh,

509
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
unnamed company coming up here in about a half an hour

510
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
to talk about some joint projects.

511
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And,

512
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
uh,

513
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
uh,

514
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
yeah.

515
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So we'll keep,

516
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
better as well.

517
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Keep em busy.

518
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
All right, man,

519
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
fantastic.

520
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Um,

521
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
well,

522
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
that's it for dev cast number one.

523
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Be on the lookout for dev cast number two by tomorrow.

524
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And of course,

525
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
uh,

526
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
be on the lookout for your golden ticket.

527
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Andrew,

528
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
thank you very much,

529
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
man.

530
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'll talk to you later in the week.

531
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
All righty.

532
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Get this podcast and we're great ones like it.

533
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
