00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
For the first time ever, the Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. in one action-packed DVD collection,

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,000
own all 27 episodes, the cult hit, including all new interviews with Carlton Koo.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,560
First thing that Brisco did that impressed us was, we're not only to come in and really read the dialogue well as an actor,

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,720
but he also did a standing flip in our office.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,640
You flipped too for Brisco County!

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,360
If you like the kind of TV you can't get on TV, get your copy of the Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,360
Available now on DVD!

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,760
Hi, this is Andy Rooney. Have you ever noticed that Adam Curry is up to 473 shows?

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,440
Why is that? Is it because he has nice hair?

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,920
I used to have nice hair, and then at all turn gray because I started getting real cranky,

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,360
and my doctor says it somehow related to my heredity.

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,120
But 473 shows is just amazing!

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:05,040
I do a weekly show, and if I wanted to do 473 shows, I'd have to do one every week for over nine years.

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,800
That's what that of vacation, and I kind of like my vacations.

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:15,520
So Koo knows that, I'm Curry here and all, that's just amazing 473 shows on the Daily Source Cup.

16
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,200
I think I'm flying into the future.

17
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:27,120

I can't wait, I can't wait

20
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,820
I can't wait, thinking of you

21
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,820
With all the thoughts you could be through

22
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,020
I'll tell you for days and days

23
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,020
I can't hold my knees and die

24
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:37,120
Oh, I can't take it anymore

25
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,120
Just to know that we've fallen no more

26
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,120
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

27
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,120
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey

28
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,520
I can't wait I can't wait

29
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,120
I can't wait, I can't wait

30
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,720
I can't wait, I can't wait

31
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,920
Fire Apes.

32
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,320
Hey Kate from the pod safe music network

33
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,520
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

34
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,920
It's Wednesday coming to you

35
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,520
from the Couricotteage in the affluent

36
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,120
supper of Surrey Known as Gilford

37
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,720
It is the daily source code

38
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,520
Episode 4703 already

39
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,920
I still wonder if I shouldn't just

40
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,920
shit.

41
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,280
I do appreciate you sending in those customized intros because it doesn't make it that

42
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,640
much more exciting.

43
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,280
And really, of course, it's been more episodes of 473.

44
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,200
I've got a comment today from someone who said he's been listening a little bit longer

45
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
than that.

46
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Hi, Adam.

47
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,560
It's 4am for Nichols, of transport, of dot com.

48
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
I'm just weird.

49
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,920
I was like, I've been listening to your shirts for two years, nice to be able to use that.

50
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
Yeah.

51
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,880
And, um, Blimey, I remember when it was, uh, the DSC, uh, message me as a Charlie.

52
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,040
Uh, you didn't number the shows.

53
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,880
I think the first time I listened to your show, or a ran the first time, um, you're

54
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:08,440
waiting for the cash results from your mum, um, and, um, you're just as good as Matt Weinstein.

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,640
And, um, um, I'm just trying to see why me, it just seems so long ago.

56
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,240
It's been a bit of a lifetime, really, but two years got just been really quite quickly

57
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
long this time.

58
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,920
But same day, another way, so, anyway, there we are, um, all this.

59
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,920
So, yep.

60
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
I'll fold it at least.

61
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
Bye.

62
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,920
Yeah, thanks Paul.

63
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,920
Yeah, you know, uh, so much has happened.

64
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
We think about it.

65
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,520
We've been doing this for quite a while, haven't we?

66
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,920
And time flies when you're having fun.

67
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Man, oh, man.

68
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
Oh, man.

69
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
You're right, Paul.

70
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,920
Wow.

71
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,920
It's, uh, that was still when I was living at the Curry Castle in Belgium.

72
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:48,520
Uh, so it's, uh, it's Wednesday morning and, uh, got home, uh, relatively late last night

73
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:55,600
because we had our, our, uh, London live, uh, I'd have to say extra have against almost

74
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,200
because it was, it wasn't just one event or one show that we were doing.

75
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,880
It was, uh, really a conicopia of programming all from the roundhouse, which is a, uh, actually

76
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,520
that's where Hendrix played, um, hasn't the who played there as well.

77
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,200
I mean, it's recently refurbished and, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

78
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,040
and the Digital Music Awards 2006 for being held there, which is sponsored by our partner

79
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,440
here in the UK British Telecom.

80
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,640
And it was, it was a lot of fun, um, uh, I'm sure that most of you, looking from the statistics

81
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,600
and, uh, even some of the problems for some people getting into seeing the streams, most of

82
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:34,280
you who listed the show may have, uh, taken a peeker to, it was a lot of fun, uh, we recorded

83
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,000
a couple different programs, but also streamed everything live as it was going out.

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,320
And I have to say, it had a very, uh, I think I said this before, it had one of those

85
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,560
real good live fields to it.

86
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,560
You know, I was sitting at home in the morning, uh, watching all this stuff just happening

87
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,040
live and, and what was so cool is that it was, no one was really briefed about what was

88
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
going on.

89
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,360
Um, yes, of course, the, the, the people that we had hired to host the shows and to produce

90
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,280
it, and they know what podcasting is, but didn't necessarily come out of the podcast

91
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
in community.

92
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,880
There is, of course, a beautiful podcast in community in the UK, but we purposely went, uh,

93
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,000
for something a little bit different, and we found, uh, some guys who helped us out

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,640
with, uh, with the video, um, you know, we really, it was, it was old old school, man.

95
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:26,000
It was like Scotch tape and, uh, and bailing wire was just stringing everything together,

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
but we have footage of everything from beginning to end.

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,720
Of course, the actual, uh, award ceremony itself took place.

98
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,760
It was recorded by, uh, um, channel four.

99
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,160
I think this Saturday, they're doing some kind of highlights.

100
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,960
Uh, I haven't even seen the newspapers today.

101
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,600
Of course, uh, I'm, um, I'm well aware of who the winners were and, uh, the most exciting

102
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,080
one, of course, with the podcast category was kind of interesting.

103
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,720
We came into the game pretty late, and I think that of all the nominations for podcast,

104
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,280
only one was a completely independent podcast.

105
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:02,160
The other ones were, um, I think BBC, I believe there was a couple radio stations who had

106
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,160
podcast that were nominated, but the London electricity podcast, uh, one by, like, like,

107
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,880
10 miles worth of votes.

108
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,200
Uh, and I was so pleased that it was the only independently produced podcast that was nominated

109
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
that actually won.

110
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,520
So that was extremely cool.

111
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,400
You know, uh, dinner wasn't your typical rubber chicken dinner.

112
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,080
Actually, it was, it was pretty decent.

113
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,720
And the performances were great, although, you know, this is so typical when you get a venue

114
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,880
like the roundhouse, which has just been refurbished, it's completely redone, it's beautiful.

115
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,680
And, um, I think the soundproofing has changed.

116
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,320
Everything has really been redone and rethought and it's, it's a great venue.

117
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,680
But the, uh, the sound in the house meant it, although, perfect, they turned it up just too

118
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
loud.

119
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,320
I mean, when, when glasses start to shatter because they're touching each other because

120
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,200
the basses is reverberating.

121
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,720
So, you know, all the way through to the end of the, uh, to the back, to the back of the,

122
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
of the venue.

123
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,960
And we were up front, of course, uh, then you know, something was just going on.

124
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,720
It was way too loud.

125
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,160
With some fun stuff happened, uh, let's see Peter Gabriel drop by and he hung out, uh,

126
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,000
we got him on the stream and, uh, and of course, that'll also be on, uh, a number of

127
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
different shows.

128
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,640
It, um, what I, what I'm, really, what, what, what, what I've learned is, and I, I mentioned

129
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,320
this yesterday on the show.

130
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,280
I really do miss, um, that live feel.

131
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,440
Uh, I love doing my podcast and, you know, and it, yeah, it takes time to do it every

132
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,400
single day, but I, I do it, I love it.

133
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,880
I love just getting up doing it.

134
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,520
I know you guys are going to hear it eventually.

135
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,160
And we, you know, I have a real feeling and a vibe as to how it flows and how people

136
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
listening.

137
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,120
But when you do something live, it is very, very different.

138
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,880
And there is a whole different type of excitement.

139
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,280
And I think that we're going to be doing a lot more live, particularly with video.

140
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,560
I think we'll be doing a lot more live stuff because, you know, it's live at the moment

141
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
it's live.

142
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,080
And then there's all the stuff that you can pull out of it that can obviously be time

143
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:03,640
shifted and and download it and enjoy your convenience in the podcast delivery format.

144
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,360
But at the end of the day, it's all independently produced stuff.

145
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,800
It's all stuff that, you know, talent people who have the tools and the distribution

146
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,080
are just making things.

147
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,920
And I'm, uh, I was excited already, uh, about what we're doing.

148
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,400
But just doing that last night really brought a lot of things back to me.

149
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,200
Uh, you know, I remember a lot of the live MTV shoots.

150
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,200
You just can't parallel that excitement, particularly when there's a party.

151
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,320
So I think we'll be doing a lot more.

152
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,160
There's, there's something else coming up, which I think is, is it end of October or November?

153
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,160
It's in the city in London, which is a huge independent music event throughout the entire

154
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,160
city.

155
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,560
And it really is the event in the UK.

156
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,200
I have a feeling we might do something with that because we've just learned so much.

157
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,040
And the audience clearly was into it.

158
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,120
As we could tell from all the traffic coming through on on the streams.

159
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
Yo, Adam.

160
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Yo, truck time.

161
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,520
I heard you complaining that you didn't think there was enough audio coming out of the

162
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:03,760
portable media expo that was held this last weekend in Ontario, California.

163
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,240
And I wanted to make you and everyone else aware that I recorded a bunch of audio while

164
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
I was there.

165
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:16,840
I was able to attend and been rolling that out ever since the Saturday night that it began

166
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,320
and coming up over the next few days.

167
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,640
And next week, I was able to record an interview with Father Roderick that does the

168
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,320
Daily Breakfast Podcast and the Catholic Insider Podcast.

169
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,200
I've got an interview I recorded with Brad Gibson that does the Bradcast.

170
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,440
Yes, the Bradcast is back.

171
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,880
Also have an interview I recorded with Chris Mark court.

172
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:46,080
Of course, Chris does the tips from the top floor, digital photography podcast.

173
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:52,040
Last but not least, I've got an interview I recorded with Bruce Murray that does the

174
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,040
Zedcast.

175
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:03,440
You can check all of these out at trucker-tombpodcast.com or trucker-tomb.podge-show.com.

176
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,320
We'll see you later, my friend, and you have a good one.

177
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,840
Alright, T2, trucker-tomb.

178
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,080
Yeah, that is the other side of it.

179
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,000
I really am bummed that I didn't get to hang out and hook up with everybody at the podcast

180
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
that I spoke.

181
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,800
It looked like everyone had a great time.

182
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,400
Both involved and not involved with Podshow.

183
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,480
And it looked like it was a very successful event and everybody had a good time and I

184
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,560
have been listening to Podcast now as I started to flow out.

185
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,600
There is always that delayed effect.

186
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,240
You know, when you go to a blogger's type conference, it's always live happening at the

187
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,520
very second because it's much easier to write and post something that it is to record,

188
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,560
perhaps edit and upload.

189
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,400
I saw some amazing video on our UnExpo2 feed.

190
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,800
Marion Carley in the pool, I'm still live on that Michelle from whispered pearls apparently.

191
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,280
Also in the pool, Michael Butler, she sent me an email and said, you know, I sent

192
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,280
them, I gave a naked picture of me to Michael Butler to give to you.

193
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,160
Hey, Butler, dude, stop Jones and William, I mean, not Jones and what is it?

194
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
Stop, harshen.

195
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,400
Stop, pass it on, then.

196
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,880
Come on, Butler, where's the picture?

197
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,520
Hey, Adam, how you doing Darren here with extreme Pods.com.

198
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,400
Hey, I, on the Asparagus P and being compatible with my wife and I both have that gene.

199
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,520
So maybe you're on to something there, but my wife would be a, a wrap around the fingers

200
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,280
then a folder and I would be a scruncher.

201
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,880
So there goes your theory right out the window on that one.

202
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,640
Okay, well, we're still going to continue.

203
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,200
I do believe that the compatibility of Asparagus, skunk, smelling people, that if you both

204
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,600
have the same gene, maybe you do belong together, that's a theory working on now.

205
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,640
I have to agree that it does not seem that there's any correlation between being able

206
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,120
to smell or smell like Asparagus be and being a folder or a scruncher.

207
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,680
And also, thanks for everything you did down at the expo, we had fun with all the Pods

208
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,120
show family down there, room of girls on and group, Pods, sick, amateur travel.

209
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,880
All those guys were a blast, who'd like to say, thanks to you and thanks to Pods.

210
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,440
So have a good one and check out extreme Pods.com.

211
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,240
Bye, I'm in.

212
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,640
Hope everyone had a good time.

213
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,200
Ah, Sunday, I head off to San Francisco for a couple of weeks.

214
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,800
It'll be good to be back in, in San Fran at Pods Show HQ.

215
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,600
It's been, how was it been now two months already?

216
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,720
It's just been a long time.

217
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,400
Not that I don't mind being home, mind you.

218
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,480
It's going to be interesting because we're still working on the house with the covenant

219
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,720
before the garage.

220
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,960
It's not going to have to be doing that with eight hour times own difference, which always

221
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,280
makes things a little bit more interesting and challenging.

222
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,040
But I think we're going to get this done really, really hope so it'll be so nice to just

223
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,080
have a place to call our own finally instead of being stuck in the rentals.

224
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,480
So it's still got a busy week ahead.

225
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,800
In fact, when I finish up and get the show up today, I'm off to London because this week

226
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,560
was not just for fun and games and for making content, but also for a number of sales

227
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,560
calls.

228
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,880
So we're hitting a number of agencies and advertisers that we've been teeing up and lining

229
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,960
up for our official launch or unleash, I should say, of Pods Show in the UK.

230
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,840
You can tell we're already doing this a little bit differently than a year ago, basically.

231
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,880
And also, it's a whole different country.

232
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,840
So there's different things and different ideas we want to try out.

233
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,400
And of course, we have a partner here.

234
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,760
So there's a lot to be done.

235
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:38,560
And also more meetings with more creative people who want to do some podcasters and just

236
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,560
non-podcaster or podcaster virgins, I would say, who just have some creative juice

237
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,520
they want to let go.

238
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,280
So that'll be most of this week.

239
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,480
Probably we'll get a shot every single day.

240
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,480
I'm hoping.

241
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,600
And then, of course, the trip will be on Sunday.

242
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,080
So I'll be back on Monday, obviously.

243
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,960
I'm going to miss the girls because I always do.

244
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,600
It's been here so long that now I really know I'm going to miss the girls.

245
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,960
They tried to stop us.

246
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,520
They tried to move us.

247
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,080
But we're back.

248
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:16,480
It's the Pod Show music rewind, audition to pool party.

249
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,440
We're featuring the hottest podcasters on the planet.

250
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
Canna Slupis.

251
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
I'm doing fine.

252
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,760
I'm on about 3rd or 4th Corona.

253
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,760
So I'm good.

254
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,760
Drew Domkiss.

255
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,040
Square One is that they're around.

256
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,440
And they're Dawn's favorites.

257
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
She's had them for years.

258
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,440
My gold bookler.

259
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,440
By the way, Marcus's wife really wants to bang me.

260
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,440
And GB.

261
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,200
Yeah, I was a virgin to the podcas.

262
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Expo before.

263
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
This is my first time.

264
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
C.C. Chapman.

265
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
The head home for I do.

266
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
What's up?

267
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
C.C.

268
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
I've been seeing you all a lot.

269
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
I've been running around like crazy.

270
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
I know.

271
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,200
I've been going to party after party, after sweet, after party.

272
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
And you know.

273
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Please help me.

274
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Brother Long.

275
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Thank you for baking that special.

276
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
I appreciate that.

277
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
Julian Smith.

278
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
What's up, man?

279
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
I just got alcohol in my eyes.

280
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
I'm not going to explain to you how that happened.

281
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
But it did.

282
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
The test drive girl.

283
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Hi.

284
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,200
Brent Bradley, booze and networking.

285
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
That's it.

286
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
In that order.

287
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Yeah.

288
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
Bill Fortune.

289
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,200
50,000 wants something like a million.

290
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
MB.

291
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,200
I am hanging out with podcasting music royalty.

292
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
J.A. Donley.

293
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Rock roll geeks at high to your life.

294
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
And how's everything going on?

295
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Uh, good.

296
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
I'm very secure with that.

297
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Okay.

298
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,200
Joe Clyde.

299
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Are you ready to rock?

300
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Jasper Borgman.

301
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,200
I've never seen or tasted anything like a Richard Bruer.

302
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Hey.

303
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
To use an arrow.

304
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
I think we could put a good job this time.

305
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Joe performance by Whitney Steel and Jimmy Golding.

306
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
I enjoyed it thoroughly.

307
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Thank you very much for the experience.

308
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,200

Oh.

321
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Hey there.

I'm Christina Curry, one of the hosts of the BG Blast.

323
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Be sure to tune in to this week's episode where I showcase new music by Melo Bright

324
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Van.

325
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
Sean J. and more.

326
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Listen to hear about the exciting hollow scream promotion where one lucky listener will

327
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
get a free trip to Bush Gardens.

328
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
We even learn about hippo camps.

329
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,200
And I share the star of my most recent drama in the dressing room of London's

330
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
pop shop clilling star.

331
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Tune in this week and check it out.

332
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,200
I was pretty cool last night when we walked down the red carpet.

333
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,200
So it was me, Ron, his wife, Marta.

334
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Patricia, as you know, couldn't come because of the dental surgery.

335
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,200
She felt really shitty and still feels bad today.

336
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,200
So I had my daughter on my arm.

337
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Man, she's so beautiful.

338
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,200
And of course, as we're walking up the red carpet and the photographers are flashing.

339
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Then Olivia, who was doing the London live red carpet coverage for us.

340
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,200
You know, she asks Marta, what are you wearing?

341
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
And I think it was all Gucci.

342
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
And then she says to Christina, what are you wearing?

343
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Christina says top shop, of course.

344
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Which is so cute.

345
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Anyone who lives in the UK knows what I'm talking about.

346
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
That was very fun.

347
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Let's see about five minutes left before the satellite window closes.

348
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Daily from writing with the windows down sent me a comment about foldering or scrunching,

349
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
which I've not listened to.

350
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,200
So should we take the gamble together?

351
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
I think we can.

352
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,200
Hey, Adam Chris daily here from the PMC Top 10 at pod music countdown.com.

353
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,200
And I have some information for your folder structure database.

354
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:14,200
I have sent you a copy of the image from playboy February 1994.

355
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,200
The one with anonical Smith as a red hot Valentine on the cover.

356
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,200
But inside is the real story in a section of random facts.

357
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,200
It's said, according to a survey by the makers of northern bathroom tissue.

358
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:34,200
Percentage of Americans who wrapped their toilet paper around their hand in the prepping stage 30.

359
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:40,200
Percentage who fold it 30 percentage who crumple 40.

360
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,200
So we're talking way back in 1994.

361
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Northern bathroom tissue did a survey 30 percent folders 40 percent scrunchers

362
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,200
and another 30 percent who wrap it around and then fold it.

363
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,200
I know I've kept this a secret through all my comments.

364
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,200
I'm one of those 30 percent who wraps it around and then folds it.

365
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
So I'm a modified folder.

366
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Just a more info to add to the extensive folder scruncher database.

367
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,200
And you know, I always end my shows by saying keep it real.

368
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,200
It doesn't get any more real than folding and scrunching.

369
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,200
Next Chris.

370
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Okay, 12 years ago, though.

371
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,200
I think that the makeup of that those percentages may have changed a little bit.

372
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,200
I really believe folders are on the rise.

373
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Remember whenever you call into the phone lines.

374
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
Let us know if you're a folder or scruncher.

375
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,200
The consensus or the census does continue.

376
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,200
And eventually we're going to publish our scientificly found results that I promised you.

377
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
One more song from the pod save music now.

378
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,200
We're this one showed up on the top 10 that was played yesterday, top 10 pod plays.

379
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,200
And I really like that it's hip hop, but it has a strong message.

380
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,200
And I'm just a sucker for a great audio sample.

381
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:54,200
So even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow,

382
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,200
I still have a dream.

383
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,200
It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

384
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
I have a dream.

385
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,200
It's one thing.

386
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,200
This nation will rise up.

387
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,200
Live out the true meaning of its dream.

388
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,200
We hold these truths to be self-evident.

389
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,200
And hold me in our creativity.

390
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
I have a dream.

391
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,200
To take a nation of willingness to hold this back.

392
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Brown for sport.

393
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
I have a dream.

394
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
To take a nation of willingness to hold this back.

395
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
I have a dream.

396
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
To take a nation of willingness to hold this back.

397
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
I have a dream.

398
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
To take a nation of willingness to hold this back.

399
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I have a dream.

400
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
To take a nation of willingness to hold this back.

401
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
I have a dream.

402
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
To take a nation of willingness to hold this back.

403
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
I have a dream.

404
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
To take a nation of willingness to hold this back.

405
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
I have a dream.

406
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
To take a nation of willingness to hold this back.

407
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
I have a dream.

408
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,200
To take a nation of willingness to hold this back.

409
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,200
I have a dream.

410
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
To take a nation of willingness to hold this back.

411
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,200
I have a dream.

412
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
To take a nation of willingness to hold this back.

413
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
I have a dream.

414
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:12,200
To take a nation of willingness to hold this back.

415
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:19,200
I have a dream.

416
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,200
To take a nation of willingness to hold this back.

417
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,880
A game civil rights bill voting rights,

418
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,080
Axe, ass, modern day Jesus.

419
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,360
Turnin' under cheek, some blacks like dog,

420
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,200
that's weak.

421
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,080
I'm not lookin' to give me deep in the next week.

422
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,640
My everyday life is pretty brutality.

423
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,000
Maca picked up Axe and dropped his slave name.

424
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,720
Radical change to fence by any means.

425
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,880
When our hearts turn back,

426
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,120
select our protection.

427
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,960
Why sublacks shall we enlist together?

428
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,480
They're race crimes.

429
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,880
People that don't care, warfare or watch tier guests,

430
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,720
bullets flying.

431
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,920
GMK, gotta assassinate it.

432
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,880
And they're okay.

433
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,480
He got assassinated.

434
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,800
Malcolm X, got assassinated.

435
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,200
So it's up to us to keep that dream alive.

436
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,040
Freedom ring, freedom ring, freedom ring.

437
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,200
I have a dream ring.

438
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,680
Freedom ring, freedom ring, freedom ring.

439
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,480
That's a lot of things to do with you.

440
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

441
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,640
All that freedom ring, freedom ring.

442
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,800
Freedom ring, freedom ring.

443
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,560
I have a dream ring.

444
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,040
Freedom ring, freedom ring.

445
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,240
The creating of criminal truth,

446
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,760
and one who thinks he calls the evil self,

447
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,160
a favor for freedom.

448
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,800
My blamed him from the cockpit, is his maker.

449
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,920
Flowcabulari, let's freedom ring

450
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,240
from the pod save music network. Of course, the link to that in the show notes today at daily

451
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,600
source code dot com. See, I told you it was a little different, but I kind of dug it.

452
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,880
Sidelight windows closing everybody on serious. Those of you still hanging out for the podcast,

453
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,960
you are in luck because, uh, well, it's a more cool shit to listen to.

454
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:19,120
Oh, baby, you've got us. You've got us completely. And from now on, Adam, every orgasm, we have

455
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:26,720
as a pod show orgasm. This is Michelle at whisper pearls. My sister and I are very happy to

456
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:36,000
join the pod show family. Thanks, Adam. whisper pearls now at whisper pearls dot pod show dot com.

457
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,880
Yay. I love that. As nothing like sitting on a 10 hour flight listening to girls talk with

458
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,320
low sexy voices about having sex. That is the true magic of whisper pearls. Is your computer

459
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:55,200
a hacker magnet? It won't be anymore because Earthlinke is here to save the day.

460
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,840
With Donald's faster than speeding bullet. And far while it is more powerful, going to look

461
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:10,800
on the motor. It has an anti-virus system that cleanses your PC with the click of a mouse.

462
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:17,600
It's a bird. It's a plane. It's Earthlinke. Perfect internet from outer space that

463
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:23,040
links to Earth with powers and abilities far greater than those of normal high speed. And prices

464
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,080
so low that it will blow you out of this world. So make the right decision and turn to Earthlinke

465
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:37,520
as your internet provider. All right, everybody, that's it. I really got to get dressed,

466
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,400
which would require a shower before that. So I got to go. I got to get off the London town again.

467
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,880
Thank you so much for tuning in. As always, Adam and pod show dot com to send you love. And

471
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,680
Bye. I mean, really. Thank you for listening. Bye. Bye. Bye.
