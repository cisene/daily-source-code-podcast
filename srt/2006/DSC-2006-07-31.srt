8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm testing kids that I'm curry.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Got to get myself together.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Got to get myself back straight.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Need to clean my weary head now.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Got to get back in.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Just change yourself.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You'll be driving me crazy.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You'll be thinking you'll do all the time.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Stronger things that happen to me.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I can't tell you why I can't.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's been like this for a long time.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Got to change yourself.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You'll be driving me crazy.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You'll be thinking you'll do all the time.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You'll be thinking you'll do all the time.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Got to do some business.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Got to find a way to change my life.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
saying to be In a risk.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Feeling that twice my age.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Cause it's you beingnothing.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,960
You being muacri-

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,000
Being me being you all the time.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,300
Time

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We'll see you in the mother

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I realize that we're late

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The way you are the way you treat me

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But the guess is just in a life

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Is it you, babe?

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Just can't believe you

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You, babe, this'll be here all the time

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I think now that I'm just leaving

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Don't think I'm making right

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I think that I need to face it

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I wanna change less about it tonight

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Cause I'm the you, babe

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Driving me crazy, you, babe

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Driving me insane, you, babe

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Never be okay, you, babe

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Breaking my heart all the time

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm just gonna make my own

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Taking my brother's love

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Taking my brother's love

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Taking my brother's love

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Taking my brother's love

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, man, have I time warped into the 60s

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Or have I just visited the potsape using that word once again?

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,500
Tones get myself together, kicking off a brand new week of the Daily Source code.

58
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Everybody how you doing?

59
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,000
Han, Han, Han, Han!

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,500
Ah, I could yell all I want.

61
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,000
She won't hear me.

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Because I'm still in San Francisco.

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,800
That's right, coming to you from the Curry condo on the 24th floor of the Metropolitan

64
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,000
and sunny northern California.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Uh-huh.

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,500
Why am I still here?

67
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,000
I was supposed to leave on Saturday.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I would have been home Sunday in my baby's arms.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Well, I'll tell you why.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,500
Friday while, uh, while actually while back lab was performing live at Fubar Friday

71
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
in our office.

72
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,500
Ron and I sat down and reviewed, uh, not just this week, but, uh, the week before that

73
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,500
we've, as you know, we've really been working on, uh,

74
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,500
yeah, setting our, setting ourselves up for the next phase of our growth.

75
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Of course, we're a media company now that we have, uh,

76
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,500
this big jeloppy called the pod show plus out there floating about.

77
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,500
Um, we, it's, uh, it's, um, there's so much is so right.

78
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
Yet so much is so wrong.

79
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,500
There's just so much to do, particularly, uh, on the, uh,

80
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,500
I mean, you know what it is, you build something like this.

81
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
There's so many features.

82
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,500
Some, some things turned out better than we expected.

83
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Many things turned out, and not at all the way we expected.

84
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:49,500
Um, it's very hard to, um, uh, really to spec something out when it's, uh,

85
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
when it's still a dream.

86
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,500
And when you start to play with it, that's when, and it's not, you know,

87
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,500
it's not things that we actually could have played with in beta until you,

88
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
as I just me or, or anyone else playing.

89
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,500
It's really what, what people are saying, what we're feeling, uh,

90
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
the feedback we're getting.

91
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,500
And just some simple logic, and, uh, I said,

92
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
they're on it.

93
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
And then we, we have, we got work to do.

94
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
And I just can't go back.

95
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Uh, I want to, I want to set us up this week.

96
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Uh, you know, just to, to get the last pieces have to all fit in.

97
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,500
So we can get to the next stage, which, of course, includes more development.

98
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,500
So I decided to stay, uh, staying for, uh, well, uh, a couple more days,

99
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,500
but really in, uh, in all, uh, reality that triple be extended now for five days.

100
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,500
So about a three, uh, more than three weeks by the time I get home.

101
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,500
And even though I missed the girls dearly, uh, not quite as much as they missed me.

102
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Oh, man.

103
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
That was a call.

104
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
I wasn't looking forward to making Saturday morning.

105
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Anyway, of course, Patricia understood.

106
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
And, uh, and it's so sad.

107
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
The girls that, you know, they had done their hair.

108
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
They had, uh, I guess they had even, uh,

109
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,500
uh, that new color in their hair, which, uh, man,

110
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
I hope I would have noticed when I got home.

111
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,500
But nothing worse than not realizing it and not saying anything.

112
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,500
You know, and Patricia done all the grocery shopping and had, you know,

113
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,500
because of good stuff to eat.

114
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,500
And, uh, so of course she was a little bit disappointed,

115
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
but she understood very well.

116
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,500
And, and the real problem is the house.

117
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,500
The new curry cottage that we're, uh, we're in the throes of trying to buy, um,

118
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,500
because she had set up an appointment with me for today from Monday, 10 a.m.

119
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
to go and look at the house.

120
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
I have not actually seen the place of seeing the brochure.

121
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
I've seen pictures that she's taken.

122
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
I've seen pictures in the brochure.

123
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,500
I trust my wife implicitly, of course.

124
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Also a good friend of ours, Mark Egan went along.

125
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Um, and he knows a lot about building and construction in homes.

126
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,500
And, uh, and about this whacked out bidding process.

127
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Actually, uh, you know what they sent to, uh, you know, like this.

128
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Here is the, uh, the, um, the paperwork that has to be filled out for this.

129
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Remember I talked about this like closed bid system.

130
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,500
So final bids have to be in by Wednesday, which is okay because I can just do that from here.

131
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,500
But you should just hear what they, what they want to know.

132
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Uh, they wish I'll require the following information at time of your offer.

133
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Details of your best and final offer subject to contract, because of course it means,

134
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
it means nothing, right?

135
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Uh, if, if you are the winning bid, you still will have a contract that still takes three weeks.

136
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Uh, confirmation as to whether you're offered a subject to survey of please, of course it is.

137
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Uh, our client reserves the right to not necessarily accept the highest offer.

138
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,500
And the ability to proceed will be taken into account.

139
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,500
That means if you don't have a house that you have to sell, that'll be taken into account.

140
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
That's a plus for us.

141
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Uh, position details of any related sale.

142
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
If applicable, please confirm your position.

143
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500
I don't know 69 in rented.

144
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,500
Oh, this is if you're renting, if you're not renting, if you set it sell, et cetera.

145
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Okay, evidence will be required to demonstrate your position to proceed.

146
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Okay.

147
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
Well, then I said, yes, you go call the rental agency.

148
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Finance is your financial position.

149
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,500
I eat cash, percentage of any borrowing, et cetera.

150
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Which I think is interesting.

151
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Um, I don't think that's really anyone's, oh, I guess, I don't know.

152
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
I'm sorry, you're right.

153
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Nope.

154
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,500
I think they do need to know this because if you can't get them, if you're buying with a mortgage and you can't get a mortgage,

155
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
then that could make it all fall through.

156
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Okay.

157
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,500
I don't know.

158
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Do you not put down 10%, or how does that?

159
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
No one's saying anything about that.

160
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:35,500
Uh, but I have to, um, send along my bank and contact details or clients reserve the right to request a bank reference should it be deemed necessary.

161
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,500
Um, and those are the main things.

162
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,500
So, just to be on the really, really safe side, I figured I'd call our banker.

163
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Uh, fair.

164
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Let her know.

165
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
So, I'm going to give your name to these guys if they call you.

166
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Now, she's in, uh, in Holland, uh, because our, um, our real bank, not, not the checking account bank, but our bank, uh, is a, uh, one of these private banking outfits.

167
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:05,500
So, I've had the same banker for like six years, and she happens to be a single 40 year old bombshell of a woman.

168
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
And I hadn't spoken to her.

169
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,500
In fact, uh, she is, uh, Patricia has said to her, you know, hey, if anything happens to me, uh, I want you to take care of Adam,

170
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
which, of course, is just fine by me.

171
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:24,500
So, um, now of course, uh, chat with Herdie for a little while, and, uh, you know, and, uh, she had a lot more to tell than I did.

172
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
So, I was like an hour-long phone call.

173
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,500
Uh, and by now it's like one PM on Saturday.

174
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,500
You know, and I've gotten up at six to make sure I call Patricia at a reasonable time during the day.

175
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:42,500
And, um, and then I call Patricia back, and so anyway, so, you know, but the time I got turned around is like three o'clock.

176
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:50,500
And, uh, uh, I should tell you, actually, uh, I don't know if it.

177
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:56,500
I wish Patricia was here because then we talked about the cyber sex that we had, but I'll have to save that until I get back home.

178
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
The cyberwank.

179
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,500
So then, uh, I was like, oh, I'm, and I'm gonna take a bath.

180
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:08,500
So, because I had all these shows, of course, I have a, um, a pod show channel, which I sync up to my iPod for when I'm, uh,

181
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:14,500
when I'm, you know, I have that, when I'm traveling, when I take that 10 hour flight between San Francisco and London.

182
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:22,500
And so, you know, instead of, uh, listening to the iPod, I draw a drew bath, a nice bubble bath, which I had not been in since my entire stay here.

183
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
And I just listened to some shows.

184
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:31,500
I listened to, um, oh, I listened to the second episode of Shadow Falls, a rough version, a rough mix.

185
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,500
You know, so I always have a couple of, uh, mainly production things I just want to send back.

186
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Oh, you're gonna love it. It's so good.

187
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:46,500
And then I listened to one of my favorite shows, uh, which I rarely get to listen to, and it's entirety, because it is a rather long show.

188
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,500
I think it's, I think it's a weekly show, but it's, it's long.

189
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Um, and so I was happy to be able to listen to whispered pearls.

190
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,500
I think episode number 33.

191
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:04,500
And Michelle, by the way, um, there was a beautiful, um, a beautiful piece for me,

192
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,500
and from my mom that they had done on whispered pearls, uh, a couple of weeks ago.

193
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,500
And I can't even remember if I even thanked him for it or not, everything was such a blur.

194
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:21,500
And then I'm listening to the show, and this is what I hear, and it was absolutely, just, you know,

195
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,500
you have to imagine, I'm kind of lonely, I'm a little bit bummed out that I'm not going to go home.

196
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,500
And, um, and then I turn on this show, and this is what I hear.

197
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:36,500
He said at the end of one of his shows recently that if you see a butterfly, the next time you see a butterfly

198
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:42,500
to think of his mom, and I don't see a whole lot of butterflies usually, where I live,

199
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:49,500
and, but I, I vowed that, okay, if I do, I'm going to honor that, I'm going to do that.

200
00:12:50,500 --> 00:13:04,500
And so, I was in my house looking out the window a couple of days ago, and outside of my window,

201
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:12,500
they're past this most beautiful red butterfly, which seems really unusual, they're red butterfly,

202
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:20,500
but in any case it was a red butterfly, and immediately I thought of Adam's mom,

203
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:26,500
and set a prayer for her, and wished her well.

204
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:37,500
And the feeling that I got was the only way I can describe it is just like this huge,

205
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,500
sort of interconnectedness of the earth feeling.

206
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Like, like, I was one of many people who were doing this, and that this butterfly,

207
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:59,500
if this is even possible, but this butterfly was smiling, and affirming that we are all connected.

208
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,500
You know, that was so beautiful Michelle.

209
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,500
I cried when I heard that, because this is the first time I've heard it on a podcast,

210
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,500
but I've heard so many people say this, who knew my mom or heard the story about her and the butterflies,

211
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,500
and I've seen it, you know, and it's in butterfly season, and the other day,

212
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,500
a butterfly flew into the house into the kitchen where when Patricia was in the kitchen.

213
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,500
And yeah, I'm sure maybe it's because you're paying attention to it, you're thinking about it.

214
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Maybe that's enough, you know, that we overlook these small, beautiful things,

215
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,500
and just for a little period of time we're thinking about it.

216
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,500
Maybe we'll keep thinking about that and think about the butterfly.

217
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,500
And there's one other thing I was really thinking, Michelle,

218
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,500
you should send me some naked pictures.

219
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Hey, this is Max, I'm the host of MusicCrafts.

220
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,500
I play some of my favorite pods and please talk a little about what I was going on the way.

221
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,500
I'm 11 years old, and I'm a little shy, am I?

222
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,500
Michelle is usually less than 20 months old.

223
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:20,500
But there's a cast that is at the good news, the IK, C-A-S-T-E-G-R-T-R.

224
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,500
You can email me at the MusicCrafts.html.com, go check it out.

225
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
It's good to be as good as it is.

226
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Nothing like a young podcaster to get your day going.

227
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Let's see.

228
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
Time now for...

229
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
Oh yeah, the Troy needs an iPod update.

230
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Man, this is really blown wide open.

231
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,500
I have to say, there's...

232
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Thank you very much for going over to dailysourcecode.com

233
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:01,500
and posting all of your entries into the comments section.

234
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Keep doing that because this week we're going to give them away.

235
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
And I feel kind of bad for Troy.

236
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,500
Not only does he think now that he's not going to receive an iPod

237
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,500
and even though he came up with the idea, he says he's getting hate mail.

238
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
This is my theory, you know.

239
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,500
It's like Andy Warhol talks about the 15 minutes of fame.

240
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:27,500
I'm telling you, at the end of the day, not a lot of people are going to want to have any kind of high visibility anywhere.

241
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,500
Because human nature is just so messed up.

242
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,500
It doesn't matter what you do, doesn't matter.

243
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:41,500
What the topic of discussion is when you connect people with equal weaponry,

244
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:49,500
which means you can't actually kill the other guy or anyone with the words.

245
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,500
You can't actually do them any bodily physical harm.

246
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:00,500
People just seem to do it and we just get all pissed off at each other.

247
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
It's amazing.

248
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:07,500
There's not a single community anywhere that doesn't have a percentage of flaming going on.

249
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,500
Some of it may be healthy, but man, I see so many communities flame out.

250
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,500
And I'm seeing this Troy needs an iPod and I feel really bad for him.

251
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,500
So Troy, no matter what, I'm sending you an iPod dude.

252
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
I promise you that.

253
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,500
And then just go to dailysourceco.com and look at all the fantastic entries.

254
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,500
It started with Troy needs an iPod.com.

255
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:33,500
Suggestion was just go ahead, come up with the best URL registered godaddy.com.

256
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,500
And of course, I'd like you to use check out code DSC3.

257
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
So I get some credit for that.

258
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,500
But you can use any other pod show.

259
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Check out code if you want.

260
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Such as it was it's Rob and Taylor from.

261
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Was it all critters?

262
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,500
She said she used her own check out code.

263
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,500
But she'd come up with what did she have?

264
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:04,500
iPod for podshow.com, stuck in my ear.com, not the most original.

265
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:10,500
With $16 million worth of airplanes strapped to my ass.com, I like that one a lot.

266
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,500
I go ahead and check it out and put your entry in today before it's too late,

267
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,500
because you can win an iPod and Troy email me your details, man.

268
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
So I can send you something.

269
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,500
Voice mail numbers?

270
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
No good calls over the weekend.

271
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
I was kind of surprised.

272
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,500
Maybe the weather was too nice.

273
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,500
But there were calls, but nothing that I really wanted to put on the air.

274
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,500
The idea here would be to stop whatever you're doing.

275
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,500
Grab your cell phone, punch this number in.

276
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,500
If you know how to do it the plus one, 201, 625, 6357.

277
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Put it in your phone right now.

278
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,500
So the next time you're listening you're on the road, you have no time to write it down.

279
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
You can just, anyway, you wake up in the middle of the night.

280
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,500
You got an idea for me.

281
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,500
You call me plus 201, 625, 6357.

282
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Or in London, 0207, 681, 375, 3.

283
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Big day today.

284
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Actually, you know what?

285
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,500
Before I do all the acts, I don't want to mess up the sound light window.

286
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,500
Today also marks a big day for the sound light window.

287
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,500
We've got a little different line up.

288
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Let me tell you about it because we are moving things around.

289
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,500
Right after the show, if you're listening to us on serious stars,

290
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,500
you're going to want to Pacific Coast.

291
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Hellway will drop by.

292
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Follow by Dawn and Drew.

293
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,500
Then the Jersey Todd show on serious.

294
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,500
This Jersey Todd, a lawyer with a sense of humor.

295
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
I think you'll like a show very much.

296
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
I listened to a show that's going out today.

297
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
I think you're going to dig a DVD weekly after that.

298
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Then CC Chapman comes in with, I don't know if he's doing axler and hash tonight on the

299
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
sidelight or not.

300
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Then Madge Weinstein with East Radio and Scottsley will rewind it up.

301
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,500
I think he's going to be doing episodes of infection on serious.

302
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,500
You want to get ready for something extremely cool, something totally new if you've never heard this before

303
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
and you're on serious.

304
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,500
You're going to hear a book as you've never heard it before.

305
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,500
Also coming up on serious stars, one or two shadow falls will also start airing as well.

306
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,500
So that's the new line up on serious.

307
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,500
Now, PW, the satellite repairman, Uncle Jesse won't get all pissed off at me.

308
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,500
And speaking of that, check out who's checking in.

309
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Hiya, Adam, carry.

310
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:24,500
Without MTV, you still would be just a local radio presenter in Netherlands, a province of European Union.

311
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,500
CSB shut up without me MTV would still be a dorky satellite channel.

312
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,500
This week MTV is celebrating 25th anniversary.

313
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:42,500
It's pretty much embarrassing because target audience of MTV are teens who obviously are younger than MTV itself.

314
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:49,500
The, since you, matey, also match to MTV, maybe you could mention what you think.

315
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,500
What do you think?

316
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Hold on, I just want to set the record straight.

317
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,500
I don't know MTV jacks shit, okay.

318
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,500
Those cocksuckers fired me seven times and kept asking me to come back,

319
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,500
which of course I did all freelance and kept raising the price.

320
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,500
So, no way, I don't owe them jacks shit, please.

321
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Ving is the future of MTV mobile games.

322
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Entering tons, or could it be?

323
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,500
No, put fucking safe music.

324
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,500
Just predict, guess, this was for fuck's sake.

325
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:30,500
I wish I could convince you to dump black fucking buried by the way and use the jelly you know what, but whatever.

326
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
Well, see ya.

327
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,500
Yo.

328
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
Yo.

329
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Three F bombs there.

330
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,500
CSB.

331
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
What's wrong?

332
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Are we on a diet today?

333
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Yeah, that's right tomorrow.

334
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,500
August 1st.

335
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,500
So, 81 is when MTV first went on the air.

336
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,500
I was not one of the original VJs, by the way.

337
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,500
I didn't arrive at MTV until 1987.

338
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:58,500
The reason why many people think that is because with my arrival, MTV had just started to penetrate into the larger cable networks.

339
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,500
And they went from like 8 million households to 40 million households.

340
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,500
So, you know, by all intents and purposes, that was for a lot of people.

341
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,500
The time I was there was the first time people were actually seeing MTV.

342
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,500
So, there's always confusion about that.

343
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,500
That's right.

344
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,500
MTV is 25 years old.

345
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:21,500
And to answer your question and a conversation blogger, no, they will never be an interactive company with any large degree of success.

346
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500
They will never be.

347
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:29,500
They will never break music through pod safe music or any of that because they are a television company.

348
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,500
Their, their mothership is a television organization.

349
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,500
There is to get out of that will be so incredibly difficult.

350
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
And honestly, they've been trying.

351
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,500
They've been trying for years to do that to have some huge successes.

352
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Now, of course, they have things that go hand in hand with, you know, they do have an interesting, interesting interactive stuff.

353
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:55,500
By the way, they silently kind of fired that, I forget who the guy was, but he was going to be the interactive guru.

354
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
He was going to make it all happen and guess what?

355
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,500
It didn't all happen.

356
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,500
They tried to consolidate all their efforts and it turned into a big pile of junk.

357
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:08,500
The one thing people ask me all the time is what happened to the music on MTV?

358
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
And I've told the story a couple times.

359
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,500
It's not that long, but I think you should understand exactly what happened to the music on MTV.

360
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
First of all, there's music everywhere.

361
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,500
There's music channels on cable, on satellite.

362
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Yeah, you can download videos.

363
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,500
You know, that is the main reason.

364
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,500
I think MTV was actually pretty smart to get away from the music videos from a business standpoint,

365
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,500
because they were losing their stranglehold on the monopoly.

366
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Even in 1988 and 1989, MTV would have to fight with the other channels like BET

367
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
for Michael Jackson premiere videos.

368
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
And rightly so, by the way.

369
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,500
So, they saw the writing on the wall, but what really did it is when the game show

370
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
Remote Control came on.

371
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,500
Remember that?

372
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:00,500
With Ken Ober, Colin Quinn, Curry, who were Steve Treakas, who was in the band.

373
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:06,500
When that came on, their ratings almost tripled to a 1.0, which is,

374
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,500
which by any network standards would be seen as a huge failure.

375
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
But that's it.

376
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,500
You know, they could sell three times as much advertising, or they could charge as much,

377
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,500
three time, or a significant amount more.

378
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,500
And they just went from there.

379
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,500
Just you look at the history of all the, what they called short form programming that

380
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,500
cropped up.

381
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,500
And that was, that was really the, the deathnell of, of music on MTV.

382
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,500
And they're not celebrating at all, by the way.

383
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
There's not a single celebration going on.

384
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,500
I think you're right.

385
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,500
They are kind of embarrassed about being that old.

386
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,500
See where your star's one or two listeners hang in there.

387
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,500
Pacific Coast Hellwise coming right up.

388
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,500
Mark Yoshimoto Namcoff is your guy in just seconds from now.

389
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,500
He's also my guy here on the Charlie.

390
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Hey Adam, it's Mark Yoshimoto Namcoff from Pacific Coast Hellway.

391
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
You remember the gin blossoms, right?

392
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
You know, hey, jealousy, till I hear from you.

393
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,500
Good stuff.

394
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,500
But whatever happened to those guys, I'll tell you.

395
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,500
The new gin blossoms record, major lodge victory,

396
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
is coming out on August 8th.

397
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,500
And the gin's in their record label,

398
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,500
we're kind enough to grant you the world podcast exclusive

399
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,500
to play their just release single, learning the hard way.

400
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
Only on PCH.

401
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,500
And I'm spending it Monday, July 31st, and afterwards,

402
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,500
I'll tell you how you can listen to most of the album for free.

403
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,500
Just so you know, I'm working on getting them to agree to release a song

404
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
or two pod safe.

405
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,500
But for now, the only place you can hear learning the hard way

406
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,500
by the gin blossoms, legally on a podcast,

407
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,500
is at pacificcoasthellway.com.

408
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,500
So thanks, Adam, for playing this promo.

409
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500
I really appreciate it.

410
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,500
And if you have any gin blossom stories,

411
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,500
I'd love to hear them.

412
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,500
Unless of course they involve sex,

413
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
in which case I know.

414
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,500
Nothing else I'll pass.

415
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,500
But anyway, I'll catch you later.

416
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,500
Bye.

417
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,500
My name is Jim Blasms and my friend,

418
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,500
and Andrew Gole and my friend.

419
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,500
They play on the same.

420
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,500
Get that shit on the pod's head music network.

421
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Yeah, where will you?

422
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,500
And then send me a comment.

423
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
Mark Yoshimo to blow off.

424
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Come on, man.

425
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:13,500
Do something really important for humanity.

426
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,500
He did get Andrew Gole to,

427
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,500
to agree to let me play never let us slip away on the show.

428
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,500
That's kind of cool because that's one of our songs.

429
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,500
But he didn't have the juice to actually get him to recut the,

430
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
the first line.

431
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,500
I know it's like, it's a big request.

432
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,500
But how cool would it be if you heard Andrew Gole say,

433
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,500
you heard Andrew Gole singing talk to Patricia on the tail of long distance.

434
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,500
You know why?

435
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
Because I always talked to a fucking long distance.

436
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
That's why.

437
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,500
Because I'm never home anymore.

438
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
It seems.

439
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
Yeah.

440
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
Also during my,

441
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,500
Yeah, so I play this whole channel that I've set up.

442
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
It's a private channel, by the way,

443
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,500
because there's all kinds of stuff in there.

444
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
I don't necessarily want people to know that.

445
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,500
I listen to.

446
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,500
So you can't find that I'm pod show plus.

447
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,500
But in that channel, because I have a video I pod,

448
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,500
I also subscribe to rock and roll TV.

449
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
I don't know if you've seen rock and roll TV,

450
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,500
it is a kick and ass in numbers,

451
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,500
because we're just seeing how many people are now watching this show.

452
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,500
And they did like,

453
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
I was completely blown away.

454
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
I really had to,

455
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500
to really focus on it for,

456
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,500
for a couple minutes before I figured out.

457
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,500
No, no, no, this is definitely set up and produced.

458
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,500
Like spinal tap.

459
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
It was like a little,

460
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
a little mini documentary documentary,

461
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
but it was really,

462
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,500
it was a modern day version of a spinal tap.

463
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
It just blew my mind,

464
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,500
but the production that went into that,

465
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,500
you have to check this out.

466
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,500
Of course, I'll put a link to that in the show notes.

467
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,500
Rock and roll TV.

468
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,500
See what share and the guys did.

469
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,500
It's pretty outrageous.

470
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,500
Speaking of show notes,

471
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,500
you'll notice that I'm doing it differently now.

472
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,500
I had a nice long talk with the Mads Weinstein Friday night.

473
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
The Mads was in Berlin.

474
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,500
It was a kind of convoluted conversation, regardless.

475
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,500
And I noticed that she hadn't heard,

476
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,500
that probably hadn't listened in a while.

477
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
And I know why, because,

478
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,500
you know, I spanked her.

479
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,500
She didn't feel too good about that.

480
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,500
And I said,

481
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,500
well,

482
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,500
you know, sorry,

483
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
you know,

484
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,500
it's not, you don't have to listen,

485
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,500
but you know,

486
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,500
I said,

487
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,500
well, you know,

488
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,500
I usually just look at the show notes and then,

489
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,500
and that'll be it.

490
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,500
And I'm like, fuck that.

491
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
I hate that shit.

492
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,500
I really, really hate it.

493
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,500
If I, so I'm like,

494
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
if I hear one more person say,

495
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,500
well,

496
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
I didn't listen to the show because I looked at the show notes.

497
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,500
I didn't think it would be interesting.

498
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,500
I'm like,

499
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
that's it.

500
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,500
I'm not doing that anymore.

501
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
That's,

502
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,500
you know,

503
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,500
you may want show notes.

504
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,500
Screw you.

505
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
You're not getting show notes in nice little chunks.

506
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,500
So you can forward ahead to stuff.

507
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,500
And you either listen to the show.

508
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,500
You don't listen to the show.

509
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Show notes are changing.

510
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
I'm just doing headlong.

511
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,500
There aren't many places where one can find information.

512
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
News from the strange and the paranormal.

513
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,500
Crypto zoology and more can be difficult to find.

514
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,500

Cryptic universe,

00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,500
where the strange and the paranormal become reality.

525
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,500
So you probably heard that my space

526
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,500
was down for like 12 hours last weekend.

527
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,500
Not this one,

528
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,500
but the one before it.

529
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,500
Oh, man.

530
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,500
I was supposed to do a sensational thing for somebody.

531
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
I've completely forgotten.

532
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,500
I'm sorry.

533
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,500
It's Monday.

534
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
You just have to live with me.

535
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,500
No sponsorship today.

536
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,500
For the sensational moment.

537
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,500
I got to set that up again.

538
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Sorry.

539
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,500
So my space was down.

540
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,500
And coming back up,

541
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,500
they had all kinds of troubles where people couldn't log it.

542
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,500
It happens from time to time.

543
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,500
We should have their problems, right?

544
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,500
I don't think I think

545
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,500
they must have had some database issues

546
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,500
and people were their friends.

547
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,500
We're not either not there

548
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,500
or some of their postings were gone

549
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,500
or their comments were gone.

550
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,500
So when I'm on the phone with Patricia,

551
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,500
I said,

552
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,500
did you notice any of that my space was down?

553
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,500
She said, and she took like a beaten.

554
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,500
She went,

555
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
so that's what it was.

556
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,500
She said,

557
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,500
I couldn't believe it.

558
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,500
And we compared timing

559
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
as to when my space was down.

560
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,500
She said,

561
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,500
well yeah,

562
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,500
Christina was in the kitchen.

563
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,500
She was chatting away.

564
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,500
And she had all kinds of fungal stories

565
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,500
to tell.

566
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
And she was helping out with cooking.

567
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,500
And I said,

568
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,500
aha,

569
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,500
that would be right.

570
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,500
So there you go.

571
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,500
Folks,

572
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,500
I think we need for parents.

573
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,500
We probably need a,

574
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,500
like it would be pretty easy to fix up.

575
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,500
I'm sure.

576
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,500
A little like proxy server or something

577
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
that you can flip on or off.

578
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,500
So when you want your kid to be with you again,

579
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,500
you just make it look like my space is down.

580
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,500
And then all of a sudden,

581
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
they reemerge.

582
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,500
They literally reappear

583
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,500
and come out of the woodwork.

584
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,500
And you know what?

585
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,500
They're actually sociable and really nice.

586
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,500
Hayadam,

587
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,500
Franco, you're from Rokastitalia.

588
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,500
Hayad,

589
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,500
you're wife,

590
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,500
both some volume bills from the farmers.

591
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,500
Wait a minute.

592
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,500
Just just to make sure they're Franco.

593
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
She thought about it.

594
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,500
I caught her just in time.

595
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,500
She but the point was there is that she saw the spam

596
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,500
and thought,

597
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
oh well, that might be kind of cheap and easy.

598
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,500
Maybe I should purchase.

599
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
Of course,

600
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,500
I made sure she didn't.

601
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
And so she didn't actually buy anything.

602
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
But your point is well made.

603
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
And you know,

604
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,500
I work as a medical doctor and I can give you a little advice.

605
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
If somebody can find questionable

606
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
to buy something from spammers,

607
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
ingesting bills,

608
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
made in some clandestine,

609
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,500
you cry and lab is absolutely a no-no.

610
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,500
You know,

611
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,500
these bills are made using

612
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,500
complicated procedures that can have

613
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,500
a lot of toxic by products.

614
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,500
And the refinement of those

615
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
is very, very important.

616
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,500
So please just give Patricia this advice.

617
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Don't eat those pills.

618
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,500
Okay.

619
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,500
It's over now.

620
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
And the doctor is a folder.

621
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,500
Other doctors are a folder.

622
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,500
Of course you are because you know it's good for you.

623
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,500
You know what's next, don't you?

624
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
Franco says,

625
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,500
don't eat the pills.

626
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,500
Don't eat the pills you buy from the spammers.

627
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,500
It's where I love about pot-safe music, man.

628
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,500
You look at her, look right here.

629
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,500
Be pretty topical if they want to, you know?

630
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
Check out what the genders have to say

631
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
the rock and roll.

632
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
No junkies in Geneva.

633
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,500
But if you're ever up on my side of the whole green line,

634
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:55,500
I'll take you down to the sea.

635
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:01,500
Down here, the folks are scared of death.

636
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,500
Then we're super,

637
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,500
you watch it now for the fire.

638
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:13,500
One of the buckles in the ideal.

639
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
I watch it now for the mama.

640
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:22,500
Then grab all the bad boys in this pile with crazy.

641
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:28,500
Well, they've been rocking in a pile with baby.

642
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,500
All right.

643
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,500
Sitting in a pile with baby.

644
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,500
That's it.

645
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:44,500
That a girl of the nameless.

646
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,500
Don't see much and hurty days.

647
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,500
Because that must be about 19 roadblocks between her and Brown.

648
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
So they say,

649
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,500
I said,

650
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:03,500
out here, the folks are dark in peace.

651
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,500
Then we're super, you watch it now for the fire.

652
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,500
One of the buckles in this pile with crazy.

653
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,500
I watch it now for the mama.

654
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
I see what I can now see.

655
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,500
Then I say,

656
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,500
all right.

657
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:25,500
Well, they've been rocking in a pile with baby.

658
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,500
All right.

659
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:40,500
You're comfortable.

660
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,500
You're comfortable.

661
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,500
And a horse of better have round.

662
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,500
No junkies in to be in.

663
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,500
But if you're ever up on my side of a old green line,

664
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,500
I'll take you down to the sea.

665
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
That's I'm seen.

666
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:05,500
I hear the folks are dark in peace.

667
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,500
Then we're super, you watch it now for the fire.

668
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,500
One of the buckles in a secret police.

669
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,500
I watch it now for the mama.

670
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,500
Got round and all, then mammals in this pile with crazy.

671
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,500
I see.

672
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,500
Well, they've been rocking in a pile with baby.

673
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:33,500
All right.

674
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,500
I watch it now for the mama.

675
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,500
All right.

676
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
All right.

677
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,500
All right.

678
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,500
All right.

679
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,500
All right.

680
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,500
All right.

681
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,500
All right.

682
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:56,500
Just imagine for a second, the genders were signed with a big major record label.

683
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:01,500
And have to record the song a year ahead of time to even get on the schedule.

684
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,500
It's like, hey, you know, we got this great song called Rock and Romala.

685
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,500
But can you kind of coordinate that with the war so we can get it out at the same time?

686
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,500
No.

687
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
With the pod save music.

688
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,500
Just with what's happening in general.

689
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,500
Doesn't even have to do with pod save music.

690
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,500
Within dependent music and the distribution we have built right in.

691
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
The song you put it out there when you want.

692
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,500
It can be up and being played on hundreds or thousands of podcasts the next day.

693
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,500
This is truly something big.

694
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,500
Okay, everybody.

695
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,500
So it's clear what I'm going to do.

696
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,500
I'm going to pod show HQ will have heads down.

697
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,500
We're going to be working really hard with the teams today tomorrow and Wednesday.

698
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,500
And I'll still get you a show Wednesday morning.

699
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,500
And then Wednesday afternoon.

700
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
I take off going back home to Blighty.

701
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,500
So I'll be back at the cottage Thursday.

702
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
I might even do a show Thursday morning with Patricia.

703
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,500
That would be that would be possible to get it to you on time.

704
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
And then Friday and then the weekend.

705
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,500
And this weekend I'm doing something else.

706
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,500
I don't care.

707
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,500
I'm going to be doing something else.

708
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500

00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,500

711
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,500
