1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It's Cali Lewis from Geek Brief TV.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I just listened to episode 1 of Shadow Falls and it scared me.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I know I'm the fearless leader and all, but there are things that get to me in this dinner.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm not sure I'll be able to sleep tonight.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Maybe never again.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Go ahead, Moonlander. This is Houston.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm stepping down the ladder now, Houston.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I am on the ground.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This is one small step for men.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
One giant leap for Fubar Friday on the DSC 449.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Roger that, Moonlander.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Alright, boys, let's lose this tape and we can start the weekend.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I've got it.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Not like it matters.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm on the mountain.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Coming back with the records.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The orange circle actors.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Time to hold in.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Check it off while you sit.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah, yeah.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Push it off while you sit.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Once in a cell, it's in my face.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Once in a cell, it's in my face.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Come to know your way through.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Come to know your way through.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Make way for the jet set.

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Because they're taking you off.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
To start a new evolution.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The grass elastic confusion.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Gonna kill her.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Shut up while you sit.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Push it off while you sit.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Once in a cell, it's in my face.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Once in a cell, it's in my face.

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Come to know your way through.

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Start.

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Come to know your way through.

42
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Come to know your way through.

43
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Come to know your way through.

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Come to know your way through.

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Come to know your way through.

46
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Come to know your way through.

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Come to know your way through.

48
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Come to know your way through.

49
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's in trees.

50
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Static or words.

51
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
If you fast forward through the song, welcome to the daily source.

52
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's a football Friday coming to you from the curry cottage in the

53
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
affluent suburb of Suri known as Gilford and how you doing.

54
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's a beautiful day here where I am.

55
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'd love to know is Saturday great.

56
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Of course, it's winter down there today show.

57
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
As often happens, completely driven to you guys.

58
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is the stuff that's on your mind.

59
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's what you're calling in a bounce.

60
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So if you want to change the course of the Charlie to a new heading,

61
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
all you got to do is call in and give me some feedback.

62
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
This is a question I received so often.

63
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's got you to hear.

64
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This summer, I went tree planting and started listening to your back catalog.

65
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Last summer with the SC198.

66
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And I have one huge question that has been bugging me for three months now.

67
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
As I listened to maybe three or four episodes of the day along with some other podcast.

68
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Where the heck does the $16 million worth of airplane scrap to my ass quote come from?

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I've heard of just about every day, like most people who listen to it,

70
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
listening to it many times a day.

71
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I have no idea where that would have come from or the context.

72
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I've tried thinking about it and I've gotten nowhere.

73
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
If you could help me, you would make my brain stress level a lot lower.

74
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Also, check out the band The Deep Dark Woods on the part of the music network.

75
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I met these guys at a party, mentioned the PMN to them.

76
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The next morning before I could send them an email with the link to it.

77
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But it was already on it.

78
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
These guys are pretty on the ball.

79
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Thanks. Have a good day and.

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Folder.

81
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay.

82
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It doesn't matter as long as it gets clean.

83
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Alright, thanks buddy.

84
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah, a lot of people asked me that.

85
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The opening for the show is one of the most difficult things.

86
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I used to have this rock money off kind of remix music that I would use.

87
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And I always want to have something that is recognizable, just the way I like it.

88
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But it's very hard to make that yourself.

89
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I find because, you know, there's no one else to bounce off of.

90
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
There's no other voice talent. And in this case, this was made for me.

91
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It was me reading an email from a pilot who actually said that he was flying with the $16 million worth of airplane

92
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
strap to his ass with the next generation radio content in his ear, which was the daily source code at the time.

93
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He was listening to that while flying.

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And so I just read that kind of dramatically on the show one day and it got turned into an opener for the show.

95
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Another one, send it to me. If you got another opener, I'd love to have something different.

96
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's just no time, no inspiration, I guess.

97
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Now, I've been reading a couple things around the blogosphere and finally someone sent in a comment about this.

98
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And I'm glad too, because it's something I've been, you know, there's this.

99
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Have you ever seen podcastingnews.com?

100
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You know, this is supposed to be a news site.

101
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Now, when we sign up shows to the network, we send out a press release.

102
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And sometimes press releases get, well, get used as a source of information, but then extrapolate it into a opinion.

103
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Listen to the audio comment, then I'll see if I can make it.

104
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Hello, I'm this is Stephen Lewis from the rules podcast and in Larte Veritas.

105
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You can see what I look like and what my co-host looked like by going to our websites, the rulespodcast.com and in Larte Veritas.com.

106
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But I don't think it's really important what we look like, which is why I was disgusted to go to podcasting news today to find

107
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What I assume was a rehash of a media release that you sent out under the headline podshow add seven hot women.

108
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Podshow co-founded by Adam Curry announced another set of podcasting partnerships today.

109
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
This group focusing on hot women according to the company.

110
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Now, among those women, for instance, is Calli Lewis of Geek Brief TV.

111
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Is that really the best way of promoting her and what she and Neil do with the show that she's a hot woman?

112
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Speaking as a listener, promotion like this is much more likely to make me unsubscribed.

113
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It makes me queasy to think that I'm subscribed to a show that's being promoted on the merit that its host is hot.

114
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And that's for whether I'm a folder or a scruncher. Do you really want to know? Why?

115
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
No, I don't want to know. People just seem to tell me.

116
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So this obviously, it didn't sit right with me either.

117
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So I went over to podcasting news.com and their headline reads podshow adds seven in quotes hot women.

118
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And indeed, you know, the piece that that you just read there.

119
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And that even says down below, show descriptions provided by podshow.

120
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So this is what we call editorializing because I'm going to go to the original release that we sent out.

121
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Which, of course, I saw before one out and I was absolutely happy with it.

122
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Here we go.

123
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Podshow becomes home for seven of the hottest women in podcasting.

124
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Top women hosts and producers rock the house at Podshow plus with new shows, formats and direct connection to their audiences.

125
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Now, I can see there's a big difference between saying seven of the hottest women in podcasting, which really refers to their popularity.

126
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I would say mainly the popularity.

127
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
There is a slight nuance in difference, though, is to saying hot women.

128
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Because that has, it has a totally different, well, it's different words. First of all, it's not what we said.

129
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But here's the context on the first line.

130
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It makes it very clear.

131
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Podshow ain't the premier brand in podcasting.

132
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And now, today, that seven of the hottest shows featuring women hosts and produce hosts.

133
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Sorry, I butcher that.

134
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And now, today, that seven of the hottest shows featuring women hosts and producers have joined the Podshow podcast network.

135
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And that these shows are already lighting up the Podshow charts.

136
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And then it goes into, which shows are in the lineup.

137
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So, you see that there's a little bit of context that podcasting news could have added to their, quote, news.

138
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
In fact, the second paragraph, right after that opening, which gives you the context that we're saying that this is hot shows,

139
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
not hot women who are doing shows.

140
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
As a quote from me, these ladies have great talent.

141
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And all they've needed was the proper promotion and distributions that Adam Curry blah, blah, blah.

142
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Within weeks of joining Podshow, their ratings have exploded.

143
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Now, with the launch of Podshow plus, they're inventing new formats for interacting directly with their audiences.

144
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And I expect them to take their amazing skills to the next level.

145
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Now, of course, I could have added, and they all sent me naked pictures, but I didn't because that's not what this press release is about.

146
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So, I'm, uh, I hopefully that answers your question.

147
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I can see where, you know, we have to be more careful using words like that because so-called news outlets, like podcasting news, totally turn that around, unnecessary.

148
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And they didn't even read the first paragraph, because in the first paragraph, all the context has given.

149
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
If you believed any kind of news based upon a headline, and you're an idiot.

150
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So, cleared.

151
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Now, let's get back to the naked picture, shall we?

152
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Man, you guys were talking about that one on the voice mail, that's for sure.

153
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Hello, Adam. This is Kevin C. Mason from the Coloring Outside of the Lines podcast.

154
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm sorry about the audio quality. I would like to address this whole naked picture thing.

155
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Well, I just happen to be an expert on this. My day job is the fact that I am a professional body painter.

156
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
That's right. I paint on naked women for money. They take off their clothes.

157
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I paint all over their body. I take their picture. I get paid. That's how it works.

158
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Occasionally, I put their picture in a conservative art gallery somewhere.

159
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So, what is it? Great job.

160
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:33,000
This is that I've noticed that 90% of my clients are Christian and ethical at the same time.

161
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So, why do we just assume that just because someone is Christian that they wouldn't want to have their picture taken?

162
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I can't stand the audio dude. I got to cut you off there.

163
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
In case you just dropped into this, into this threat of shows.

164
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I asked Carmen Tyler for a naked picture a couple of times. Carmen Tyler is beautiful woman, former Miss Louisiana.

165
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
She's a singer. She has solitary pictures on her webpage. Do I really care if she sends him? I'll live.

166
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But, you know, I'm going to be 42 in a couple days. You send me some naked pictures.

167
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Everyone's coming down on me. It's like I shouldn't be asking this sweet, pristine girl these types of questions.

168
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Adam, just listening to DSC number four, four, eight.

169
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And you always say, call in. And, you know, quickly, when you have someone on your mind, the middle of a show.

170
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And I do, because this guy, calling in, defending the girl who you asked for naked pictures from, sorry if I'm horrible with the names.

171
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I agree with you totally, man. I mean, she's a big girl. She can take care of herself.

172
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And it's not completely irrational to ask for naked pictures like that. She could defend herself, man.

173
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Even if she was slightly offended by it, she's in the business, Miss USA. You know, Miss Louisiana, whatever she was, that's not a personality contest.

174
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And it's not exactly about who's the sweetest person. It fits an ass.

175
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And, you know, we don't need to have that conversation about who anybody's fooling, acting like it's not.

176
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You know, swimsuit competitions. I mean, you're, you're not watching that with the pure thoughts on your mind.

177
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And it jumps out of the career. I'm not talking about the talent, you know, for sale.

178
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
There's obviously some aspect to see realize that's going on.

179
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And the guy said, you know, he's there right there that he's assuming.

180
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You know, it happens when you make an assumption, right?

181
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You make an ass out of your arms.

182
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So, I'm not going to promote any, I have a podcast, but I do listen to and sponsor the sound of young America at maximumfund.org.

183
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So check that guy out. And I got to say, I tried it after your suggestions, I respect your opinion, but have always been, will always be.

184
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Thanks.

185
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Exactly. I'm so glad someone said that. Finally.

186
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:28,000
If you're in a missed Louisiana competition exactly, is this about, is this with God intended to be judged on exterior?

187
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Give me a break.

188
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Now you got to do is go to the experts.

189
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Hey, it's one of those hot women in podcasting.

190
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Hey, Adam, it's Callie. The last couple of days you've played two comments.

191
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
One from a guy who is on a Christian and one from a guy who used to be a Christian.

192
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Both can tend you for asking for naked pictures.

193
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This was after you played the song, Amazing Grace. Amazing Grace.

194
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Well, I'm as much of a Christian as I ever have been, and I just have to say that's what Grace is all about.

195
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
God made us naked since separated us from God. Adam and Eve covered up, but if you believe in Jesus, then it takes away that shame.

196
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
For people to tell you you have to do something in a certain way.

197
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Well, they've never experienced amazing grace.

198
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You can ask for my naked picture anytime. I may give it to you or I may not.

199
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But if asking for naked picture will send you to health, then I just have to say, God's Grace isn't as amazing as I thought.

200
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh, Callie, I can give you a couple of amazing grace. There's no problem. That's Callie Lewis from Geek Brief TV.

201
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Who I respect for a talent. Okay?

202
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Alright, I'm off the Carmentiler trip now. Now it's all about naked pictures of Callie.

203
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Hey, hey, check it out everybody.

204
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
He must have something very wise as that.

205
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Yep, you know a topic is really closed when Uncle Jesse checks in.

206
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
As you could imagine what would be being in the satellite repair business and all, I'm quite a space buff.

207
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So I'd like to share with you in your list. There's something interesting about those missing Apollo 11 materials.

208
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's a little techy, but hopefully I can make it clear and not too boring.

209
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Back in the early days of TV, when we were deciding on a national standard for Caller TV broadcast signals, there were two competing systems. Actually there was three.

210
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:44,000
A lot like the VHS versus Beta Max days, except that the decision got made before people started buying Caller TVs.

211
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:55,000
One system developed by RCA, involved using three image sensor tubes for the red, blue and green portions of the picture.

212
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It was pretty tricky because the three images had to be precisely aligned physically to look decent.

213
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And by today's standards, the pictures were pretty sorry looking.

214
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:17,000
The main competing system created by CBS used only one image tube and a synchronized spinning wheel with three colored filters on it.

215
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Since the three colored pictures came from the same tube, the result was perfect alignment and way better pictures.

216
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And even though the CBS color wheel system made far better pictures, it wound up losing.

217
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Mostly because the RCA system was more compatible with existing black and white TV sets.

218
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Something nobody would care about today, today they just ran a cell you knew things.

219
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
But the losing CBS system didn't go away.

220
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It was reborn many years later in modified form for the Apollo missions.

221
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:05,000
NASA needed smaller, lighter and foolproof cameras to document the moon missions and the color wheel was reborn.

222
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So the problem is that those original video tapes recorded in this unique format are the ones that are missing.

223
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:21,000
In this age of digital video, if we had them, we could probably convert all of the frames to digital and make extremely good copies.

224
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Better than anything the public has ever seen.

225
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I sure hope they get found.

226
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Well that's it Adam. I got to go back to keeping this window open as long as I can.

227
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
See you.

228
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Hey, what's up?

229
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Today needs to eat in the Atlantic Ocean down at the beautiful Jersey Shore.

230
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Hey, for all of you people sitting in front of your computer for listening to your cars.

231
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm standing at a power cell now, and I'm need to eat in some beautiful New Jersey water.

232
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So Adam, the song of the week, Ocean City, say my name.

233
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
So see what I have great weekend everybody. Bye-bye.

234
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Let's be on again.

235
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Something strange about the notion that I'm lying here alone.

236
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I guess I just love the sound when you say no.

237
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So I try to count the train cars, but it's dark and they're all fast.

238
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Then I know a good example of how I'm not thinking about it.

239
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Then I don't know where they go, but they're cut down to my soul.

240
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I guess I just love the sound when you say no.

241
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Then I try to climb the mountain, but I stop the long way.

242
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Because I saw the sky was falling, and I knew that sound was the same.

243
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Just a brave interpretation of an old familiar play.

244
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I guess I just loved the way you say my name.

245
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
There's something crazy and we're going through the trees and green.

246
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And it's trying to tell me something I might never hear again.

247
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Then I don't know what it's saying, but at least I'm not alone.

248
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I guess I just love the way you say my songs.

249
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Then I try to climb the mountain, but I stop the long way.

250
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Because I saw the sky was falling, and I knew that sound was the same.

251
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Just a brave interpretation of an old familiar play.

252
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I guess I just loved the way you scream my name.

253
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I just love the way you say my name.

254
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Every thing is everything is everything is everything is everything is everything.

255
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Then everything is everything is everything is everything is everything is everything is everything is everything is everything

256
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Nothing I don't know.

257
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Ocean Street from the Podsight Music Network,

258
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
same my name that from Georgia.

259
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Thank you very much, Jersey Todd, for suggesting that.

260
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
From your vacation spot, no less.

261
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Oh, so jealous.

262
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
You got your feet in some good,

263
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000

Check out their target cast about the new Akira RDX at akira.podshow.com.

278
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Hey, that Northwest Flight 42,

279
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
that I played you the audio from yesterday.

280
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Well, of course, no terrorist.

281
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It was just a bunch of rowdy guys who were, of course,

282
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
the flight was on its way to India.

283
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
These guys live in India.

284
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
So they look like terrorists.

285
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
There you go.

286
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Of course.

287
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And if they're just being guys, you know,

288
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
laughing, joking, passing cell phones around,

289
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
probably showing naked pictures.

290
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Then that's a big reason for concern.

291
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
So I've not heard any official word yet.

292
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
This is all from the Hindu Times.

293
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I think is where I got most of the info.

294
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
This is from NDTV, New Delhi TV.

295
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Let me just take a look there for you.

296
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I was scouting around for this.

297
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Nothing in the Dutch reports typical.

298
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
But the families of those men detained in Amsterdam are pretty angry.

299
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
They say they've been victimized because of their race and their religion.

300
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I was talking to Patricia about this last night.

301
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And you know, it's like,

302
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
so you look a certain way.

303
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And by the way, over a billion people look like a terrorist.

304
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Now, if you just look at the pictures that are published,

305
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
over a billion, I'm sure.

306
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You're getting profiled.

307
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Now, when you get profiled in that manner,

308
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I don't know, if it were me,

309
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
if I had kind of a dark skin,

310
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
which easily depending on whatever I'm wearing or whatever,

311
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
however, the light falls on me,

312
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
could make me look like a terrorist.

313
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And I see people looking at me,

314
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
you know, you're going to do like,

315
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
one of those things, you know,

316
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
trying to freak them out.

317
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's almost human nature.

318
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
So this crap has got to stop.

319
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It's really, really got to stop.

320
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And now, airlines are threatening to sue the government.

321
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I guess it'd be the UK and the US government

322
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
because they're losing so much money.

323
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I told you yesterday, my buddy,

324
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Yop is, he's never been as busy,

325
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
you know, business manager saying,

326
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
fuck, and I'm not going to fly.

327
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You know, and as I think do business class,

328
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
or economy class,

329
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
they're probably all flying right in air and easy jet,

330
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
which is the fantastic service,

331
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
but not if you have to be there three hours ahead of time,

332
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
just to get through security.

333
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It's not worth it.

334
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You know, they have to stay in overnight.

335
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Hotel rooms are occupancy rates.

336
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Meteoric rise since the,

337
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
since the terror threats.

338
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Well, of course,

339
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
people are not going back and forth in one day.

340
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You can't do it.

341
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
So you got to stay in a hotel.

342
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
So that may be good for the hotels,

343
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
but it's not good for the airlines,

344
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
therefore not good for the economy.

345
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And I read somewhere,

346
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I don't know if you read it,

347
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
or someone email the to me.

348
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Ah, drawing a blank on this one.

349
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Well,

350
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
the real answer to stopping all this nonsense

351
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
is to be quiet about it.

352
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So, you know,

353
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
look at all the sensationalism

354
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
that the news media have,

355
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
have created out of this,

356
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
out of this just this recent event.

357
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Forget all the rest.

358
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And you can see how it affects people

359
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
on all sides of the equation.

360
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Wouldn't it be so much better

361
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
if the secret service,

362
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
not secret service.

363
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I guess,

364
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
would be CIA or the FBI,

365
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
SASMI5,

366
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
all these guys,

367
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
you know,

368
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
if they're on to,

369
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
if they're on to guys that are planning

370
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
to blow up airplanes with liquid explosives,

371
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I say,

372
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
you go get those fuckers,

373
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
you prove it,

374
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and you cut their nuts off.

375
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And you just be quiet about it.

376
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You don't have to make this big thing about it.

377
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Just go in,

378
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
get them,

379
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
excuse me,

380
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
man,

381
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
we just have to talk to this person here.

382
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Just quietly remove him.

383
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And if they turn out to be guilty,

384
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
kill him.

385
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Now,

386
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
maybe not kill him.

387
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And I think cut their nuts off.

388
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Do something so that,

389
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
you know,

390
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
that's not even relevant.

391
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It's not.

392
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
The point is,

393
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
don't make such a big deal out of everything

394
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and frightening people.

395
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It was FDR that said the only thing

396
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
we have to fear is fear itself.

397
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It is so true.

398
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It really is.

399
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
This is just going out of control.

400
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It really is.

401
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
We've got to stop the stop this insanity,

402
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
making each other crazy.

403
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And the only way,

404
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
why we can't control the mainstream news mute.

405
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
We can't control anyone from talking about it.

406
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
But why don't we just clean up business

407
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and then a nice tidy report at the end.

408
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Here's what happened.

409
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
These guys were trying to blow up something

410
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
with liquid explosive security.

411
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It's still tight,

412
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
which of course it is.

413
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You know,

414
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
we've changed a few things,

415
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
which they may or may not.

416
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It doesn't really matter.

417
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
You know,

418
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
they foiled this before someone tried to get

419
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
through security.

420
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
They were tracking these guys.

421
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
That's the good news.

422
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Highlight that.

423
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You know, our intelligence is so good.

424
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
You can't even get to the security

425
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and we've already got your ass.

426
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
But then don't blow it all out of proportion.

427
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
What's this?

428
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
A cast master.

429
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
A cast master.

430
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
A cast master.

431
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
A cast master.

432
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
A cast master.

433
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
A cast master.

434
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
A cast master.

435
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
All right.

436
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Where are we?

437
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
What do we got going on?

438
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Oh, yeah.

439
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Promost.podshow.com.

440
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I've been picking up on that again.

441
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
That's still as a great place to put your promo in.

442
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
If you've got one,

443
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
lots of people subscribe to the podcast feed.

444
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Promost.podshow.com.

445
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I started looking at it again.

446
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Some good stuff in there.

447
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So if you got something you want to

448
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
disperse to to a whole bunch of people,

449
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
just upload your promo there.

450
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Promost.podshow.com.

451
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Adam,

452
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
This is Brian No coming to you today

453
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
from beautiful East Central Illinois.

454
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Hope you can hear the cicadas chirping in the background.

455
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Adam.

456
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Dude.

457
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I am desperate.

458
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I really, truly appreciate you including my

459
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Senatra show.

460
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
The Frank Truth in the Podshow lineup on serious.

461
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It's really a blast to do the show.

462
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And also of course,

463
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
an added bonus to work with PW every week.

464
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And I also appreciate all of the second bonus.

465
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Second prize.

466
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Two weeks working with PW.

467
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
The help that you've been to me getting the word out on other podcasts

468
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
like Studio C and World News mashup and the No Zone.

469
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Sincerely.

470
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I can't tell you how grateful I am.

471
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
But every Wednesday when you say what's coming next on the satellite,

472
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
you say that the Frank Truth is only available on serious.

473
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Dude.

474
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Stop saying that.

475
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Stop.

476
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Please.

477
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It's a podcast.

478
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It's all has been a podcast.

479
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It will continue to be a podcast.

480
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Now it's true that the podcast version is a little different from the version on serious.

481
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Since Senatra's music isn't pod save.

482
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So obviously I have to admit or abbreviate the song clips.

483
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
But the Frank Truth is indeed a podcast.

484
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
In fact, a lot of listener reviews of the show have said things like this

485
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
shouldn't work.

486
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
A podcast about Senatra without Senatra music,

487
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
but somehow it works anyway.

488
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I will be migrating the show to pod show class at some point as I have with my other projects.

489
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,000
But in the meantime people can find the podcast version of the Frank Truth on my website

490
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
at nobe.com.

491
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Or at the domain I just registered at GoDaddy for 695 using Code DSC3,

492
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
which is Adam.

493
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
The Frank Truth is a podcast too.com.

494
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Thanks again for all your help, pal.

495
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Oh and scruncher.

496
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
With an attitude like that you think I'm surprised you're a scruncher.

497
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Brian I'm sorry Matt.

498
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I got confused.

499
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I did.

500
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Okay.

501
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So I'll put that link into the show notes.

502
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
The GoDaddy link of course.

503
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I'm sorry.

504
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And I will never say that again.

505
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You called me out and I'm there for you my brother.

506
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Hi Adam.

507
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
This is Jay Jay from Finland.

508
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Yes, you have listeners all the way up to the north as well.

509
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Adam.

510
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Have you ever been to Finland?

511
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Welcome.

512
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
If you haven't.

513
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
So something about myself.

514
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I'm 31 years old.

515
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Married.

516
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Two kids.

517
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And I guess compared to many of your listeners.

518
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I'm probably one of the newest ones.

519
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I'll make from a few months back.

520
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I used to listen to your soul slate in the evenings when I'm taking my dog out for a walk.

521
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And I found your show's very, very funny.

522
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And I listen to your shows using this quite new Nokia 91 device.

523
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I remember you sometimes go, you had received one of these and he gave a short review of it in your show.

524
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You had some problems with it like using your files and stuff.

525
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Yeah.

526
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
All right.

527
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
First of all, thanks for calling in from Finland.

528
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
That's very cool.

529
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I like that.

530
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I've never been to Finland.

531
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I've been to Sweden.

532
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
But Finland, no.

533
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Of course, comic strip blogger has been to Finland.

534
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Isn't that where Nokia is located?

535
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Hey, the N91.

536
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
My problem with it is I need a phone.

537
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And if you look at that thing, you slide it open.

538
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It has the smallest keypad in the world.

539
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And that's why I love my blackberries because it's laid out so that I can, you know,

540
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
that's that patented fan layout of the keys.

541
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
So you can easily hit all the keys with two thumbs,

542
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
or even with one thumb.

543
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Left or right handed, the device works beautifully.

544
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And if you look at the Nokia N91,

545
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
although it has built in Wi-Fi and has, you know,

546
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
that the podcasting stuff, all that works great.

547
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And the sound is good and the storage is there.

548
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's a little clunky to carry around.

549
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I felt personally, but I could get over that.

550
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And the keys are just so small.

551
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I mean, I have to be able to do email with it and make phone,

552
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
really email is the, because who punches in phone numbers anymore, huh?

553
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I mean, of course, we all have the voicemail number for the source code,

554
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
stored in our phone,

555
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
plus 1, 2, 0, 1, 6, 2, 5, 6, 3, 5, 7,

556
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
or in the UK in London, 0, 2, 0, 7, 6, 8, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3.

557
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But when you can do email with those,

558
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
you can't even read the letters on the keys.

559
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
That was my problem with the N91.

560
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And I'm very sorry to hear that.

561
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And that has never happened to me, actually.

562
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
But I think this N91 is an ultimate podcasting device.

563
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I can browse the feeds with the podcasting application,

564
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
download episodes using the Wi-Fi connection,

565
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
store them on the four gig memory.

566
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And then with the same device,

567
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
call you and leave your voicemail.

568
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Think about that.

569
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Usually you have to have at least three devices.

570
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I think you were all in a queue.

571
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Okay.

572
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And lastly, Adam, about your sincere interest

573
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
to watch people's toilet behaviors.

574
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I must admit that it is very interesting to hear different stories.

575
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
No, it is interesting, isn't it?

576
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And I wonder how long that you take before someone makes a college,

577
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
so you reverse the level of fees, he's above you.

578
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Yeah, I'll follow the structure of the scenario.

579
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Well, anyway, while waiting that course to happen,

580
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
you could maybe extend your research with some new areas.

581
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It seems that you have been focused more on the bottom side

582
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
of Wi-Fi behaviors.

583
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
One interesting question.

584
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
No, I'm not interested in that.

585
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Once you've folded or scrunched,

586
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I'm not interested in what happens after that.

587
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Okay?

588
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I'd never have been.

589
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
The earthlink ad challenges coming to you close.

590
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
We have three finalists.

591
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
And I'm going to play one of them today

592
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
and Monday and Tuesday have played the two other finalists.

593
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And we're going to be announcing the winner.

594
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I think next week, $2,000 in prizes.

595
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And of course, their commercials become the commercial.

596
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Let's listen to this one.

597
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
This is a celebrity endorsement from someone that you don't know.

598
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Of course, you don't know me.

599
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
The New York Times once called me the most famous person

600
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
in New York that nobody knows.

601
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
That's true, go ahead, search it.

602
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
But you know, to $700,000 people,

603
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I am known as that guitar man from Central Park.

604
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And I'm here to tell you that earthlink is just about

605
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
the best thing you can get on the internet these days.

606
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I mean, if you're anything like me,

607
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
and you hate junk mail, earthlink spam blocker alone

608
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
is worth a high-speed connection.

609
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
It starts at 1295 a month.

610
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
It comes with free anti-virus software,

611
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
a firewall and spyware blocker.

612
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
But take the word of somebody that you don't know.

613
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And you have no reason to trust.

614
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Get earthlink.

615
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
You know, I hadn't even heard that one yet.

616
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
That's David Epilito, that guitar man.

617
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
The guy who sings in Central Park,

618
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
and that's the Tom Cruise scares me so long.

619
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I love it.

620
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
One of the three final contenders, congratulations, David.

621
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Can't wait to get to New York and hook up with him.

622
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
He is so keyed into the music scene in New York.

623
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I'll be cool to hang out with him.

624
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Go to adchallenge.podshow.com

625
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
if you want to hear the other two finalists

626
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and to keep a close eye on that

627
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
because we'll be announcing the winner very, very soon.

628
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Get out of here.

629
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Fill Walker, Colleen from Canberra, Australia.

630
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
My profile.

631
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
48 years old.

632
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Married.

633
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Three boys.

634
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Long time Charlie Listener.

635
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Start a listening around about number two, three, zero.

636
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I think.

637
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And I try and catch your show most days if I possibly can.

638
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
One is to make a couple of comments.

639
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Firstly, about your description of Australians.

640
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I have to agree with most aspects of what you said.

641
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
But one thing I just kind of agree with is

642
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
you described us as being proper, like the...

643
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

644
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Hold on a second. Hold on a second.

645
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
First of all, dude.

646
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I did not describe Australians as proper.

647
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I said, Australia.

648
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Australia has a unique combination of British properties,

649
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Dutch coziness, and American crash commercialism.

650
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It was about Australian general.

651
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Not about Australians.

652
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And I'll tell you in a moment why I made that.

653
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Why I came up with that description.

654
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I used it for Patricia.

655
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It's.

656
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Well, I'd have to say that we Australians,

657
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
and being anything but proper like the Brits.

658
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I guess it's kind of a colonial convict thing.

659
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
We do love the Brits.

660
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
But we are very different.

661
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I'll have to say.

662
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And by the sounds of things,

663
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
it's easier to buy a house here than it is to buy a house in the UK.

664
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
On to the next point,

665
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
the interesting discussion about the naked pictures

666
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
and the political correctness of some of your callers.

667
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I do find it amazing that in a country like the US

668
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
where violence is so commonplace,

669
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
and frequently shown in very graphic ways on the media,

670
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
that people all of a sudden become sensitive and caring

671
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
when it comes to something as natural as the human body.

672
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Are they men, my brother?

673
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
By the way, where is the best porn come from?

674
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
With the hottest people.

675
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I rest my case.

676
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
America in the mid-80s.

677
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And I've got to say I witnessed a lot of very graphic

678
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
and violent acts play out on Primetime TV.

679
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And in contrast to that,

680
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
so many references to mild swear words,

681
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
or glimpses of nipples or backsides are so carefully

682
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
at it out of our TV screens over there.

683
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I guess I just see it as a hypocrisy.

684
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Do they promote death before nudity?

685
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Come on, get real.

686
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
At the end of the day,

687
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I think we should all just loosen up a bit about this

688
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
and just look upon things as they really are.

689
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I mean, if the lady in question doesn't want to provide you with a photo,

690
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
she doesn't have to.

691
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
The end of story.

692
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And she's probably flattered that you asked.

693
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So, getting back to you in Australia,

694
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
make we've got little cottage down the coast,

695
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
miles from anywhere.

696
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Quite where you can sit and have a few beers

697
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
and look out over the ocean.

698
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You're more than welcome to use it any time you like.

699
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And I hope we'll see you in the girls down here one day.

700
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So, I'll catch you later.

701
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Have a great day and keep up the good work mate.

702
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Bye-bye.

703
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Oh.

704
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Fold up.

705
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Of course.

706
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Thank you.

707
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Thank you so much for the invitation.

708
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
That's very, very nice of you.

709
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Look, the reason I said I gave Patricia that description is because,

710
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
you know, I actually wanted to go.

711
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
You know, if I say, it's fucking wild down there.

712
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
If I say, the people are, you know, they work hard,

713
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
but they play hard.

714
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I went to a spinsters and bachelor's ball.

715
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
You guys know what that is.

716
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It was three days.

717
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
You get like a cup tied to your collar.

718
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
You know, so you can't lose the cup.

719
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And then you buck the you and the mud.

720
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And then you shoot carbide.

721
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
You know, milk can bombs.

722
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
And you build bonfires.

723
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And just shagging away mate.

724
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
In your swag.

725
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I loved it.

726
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I had such a good time.

727
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And really did.

728
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
You know, I should dig up that documentary.

729
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
It was so much fun.

730
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Did some amazing things.

731
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Oh, Australian people are out of their mind.

732
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
They love having fun.

733
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I'm not too big on the drinking thing.

734
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
That's just not for me.

735
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
But, you know, I'll have a beer.

736
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
No problem.

737
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It's just the great fun.

738
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Really, really open honest.

739
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I just, you know, I need to convince Patricia to come on down.

740
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
You know, so you got to start easy telling her about, you know,

741
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Hey, look, there's crash American commercialism.

742
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
In case she needs to buy something.

743
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
That's the proper English thing.

744
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Obviously she's into that.

745
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
That's why we're here.

746
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And then there's the Dutch coziness.

747
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Dude, I'm totally trying to appeal to everything I can here.

748
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
So help me out.

749
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
That cottage?

750
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
That sounds really good.

751
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Send more information like that and maybe.

752
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Maybe.

753
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I can get her to go.

754
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
And now in the interest of equal airtime.

755
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Comic strip.

756
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Comic strip.

757
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Comic strip.

758
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Comic strip.

759
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Comic strip.

760
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Comic strip.

761
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Comic strip.

762
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Comic strip.

763
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Comic strip.

764
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Comic strip.

765
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Comic strip.

766
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Like it.

767
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
And I knew formally lived.

768
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Or in the Finland or at least worked for the company.

769
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Best known there.

770
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Nokia.

771
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Hi, Adam Kerry.

772
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Here's your European Union correspondents.

773
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
So you mentioned lately on this.

774
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
See about the new countries that join European Union on January 2007.

775
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And UK wants to block free movement from these two countries.

776
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
What countries are these?

777
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Well, there are three biggest ethnic groups in Europe.

778
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Romani countries.

779
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Germany countries.

780
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
And the biggest slavic countries.

781
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Romani countries.

782
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Romani countries.

783
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Spain, France, Portugal and Romania.

784
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
The Jones EU in 2007.

785
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
So you see that Romani is a country where people speak language very similar to Italian and

786
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Bulgaria uses Russian alphabet.

787
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And that even inventors it is alphabet.

788
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
That's it.

789
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
My opinion is that UK should stay open on these two new countries.

790
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Also, batteryistically speaking politicians will be forced to close down.

791
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
And they will be forced to close down.

792
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And they will be forced to close down.

793
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And they will be forced to close down.

794
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And they will be forced to close down.

795
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And they will be forced to close down.

796
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And they will be forced to close down.

797
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
You.

798
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Hey, man, you spun it down to slow a commester blogger.

799
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I've always suspected this not being your real voice.

800
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
But now it's really noticeable.

801
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
You need to spin it up just a little bit.

802
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Or tell us who you are really are.

803
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Okay.

804
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Hey, man.

805
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I'm there with you.

806
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
They joined the European Union.

807
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
The United Kingdom.

808
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
That is.

809
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
And now, somehow, just like, Sweden, they got away with keeping their own currency.

810
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
which, of course, is great because the pound is, well, it sucks for me because I get paid in

811
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
dollars.

812
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,680
Like anything I have in America, just chop it and have to start with before you even get

813
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,680
to the tax man.

814
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:13,520
So, it's a very, very rich country, but it's an island, man.

815
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,520
That's the problem.

816
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,880
That's what everyone's talking about now.

817
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,680
It's like, you know, there's already too many people on the island.

818
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,680
So, that's why house prices are out of control and cost of living is out of control.

819
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,680
And it's, of course, very attractive for people to come here for half a year or a year,

820
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,840
work, get lots of dough, send stuff back home, and then go back.

821
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,000
So they can't have it both ways.

822
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,760
It'll be very interesting to see, but you are so right on, man.

823
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,920
I'm here and everyone talking about this here now in the United Kingdom.

824
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,840
Everyone's talking about what happens in 2007 when these borders open up and all these people

825
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,200
are going to come in and how are we going to do it with them?

826
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:52,000
Yeah, it's a very, very different world.

827
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,560
God, darn, I sound old when I say that.

828
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:04,120
Hello Adam, this is Jim Farley and several weeks ago you were kind enough to play my

829
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:09,080
song Katrina on your show as well as put it up for sale on the PMN.

830
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:13,320
You asked me to stay in touch and let you know how it's going, so I thought I'd give

831
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:19,720
you an update, especially since we're so close to the anniversary of her king Katrina.

832
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:25,160
Sales of the song of late have been lackluster, so to help boost donations, I've decided

833
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:30,480
that not only Katrina, but all of my music on the pop-safe music network will be donated

834
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,760
to her king relief.

835
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,360
I know it's been a year already, but I also know that there are still many people in that

836
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,840
area that can use a bit of assistance.

837
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:45,240
So please, once again, remind your listeners to download Katrina.

838
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:51,480
And while they're there, listen and maybe download more music like a call to glory, that's

839
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:58,000
a 9-11 tribute song written by myself and David Brush just days after September 11th.

840
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,960
I really appreciate everything you've done and poem, yeah, folder.

841
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:10,560
And then, thank you, don't thank me, check that out and donating proceeds from all of

842
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,600
his music to victims of Hurricane Katrina.

843
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:19,120
You haven't been thinking about that, that yesterday the window washer, not to the door,

844
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:25,120
normally Patricia deals with the deals with all that stuff, so he's there, he's like, obviously

845
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,560
he wanted to be paid to figure that out within seconds.

846
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,480
But then, you know, he started talking about, hey, we're going to America and I've done

847
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,720
it three years in a row now and did the West Coast, did the East Coast, now they're going

848
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:39,480
to go through, they're going to go to Memphis, I said, too, you should totally go to New

849
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,480
Orleans.

850
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,920
And he's like, well, yeah, we thought it might still be a mess if you want to support

851
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,080
these people, go there, really go down there, go check it out.

852
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:55,080
You know, it may not look like a holiday destination, but you're going to, it's going

853
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,080
to enrich your life, I promise you that.

854
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,520
And I actually convinced him, he said, you know what, you're right, we should go, we should

855
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,080
go see what's going on.

856
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:10,840
And everybody should do that if you have, if you have the possibility and remember, we

857
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,080
have to keep supporting these folks.

858
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:18,400
We really do, it doesn't end, you know, just because the news isn't covering it anymore,

859
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,400
doesn't mean that it's over.

860
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,560
And I have to say, there are days that go by and I don't think about it either.

861
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,000
So it's good to have a reminder like that, I really appreciate it.

862
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,440
And of course, I'll put all the links into the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

863
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:37,480
All right, everybody, time for me to do, uh, get out of here one last song, this is, uh,

864
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,520
seven standard and slow burn.

865
00:47:40,520 --> 00:48:02,520
Like it's a cowbell.

866
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:15,520
In this time, it's over, I'm not quite sure just how I feel.

867
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:28,880
Should I be said, just let me go, maybe both of us don't know.

868
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:41,280
Play your skies over my head, drifting over my head, I feel something, building, building

869
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,280
all up.

870
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:49,840
I run to see how I play whatever you want, this is conversation over, I never know

871
00:48:49,840 --> 00:49:19,840
what you want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this

872
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:49,840
this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I вообще experience, otherwise, this will be what I'm doing, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want , this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want now, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want, watch this, this is what I want, this is what I want, this is what I want,

873
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,240
There's over my head

874
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,640
Truth ain't over my head

875
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,640
I feel something

876
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:01,640
Building, building on

877
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,240
I don't have to say I've been

878
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,040
Whatever you don't want

879
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,240
In this conversation of me

880
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,840
I never know they'd try

881
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,440
I knew what you were like

882
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,240
I knew what you were

883
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,840
We can't come together

884
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,840
But it's over

885
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:19,240
I know, I know

886
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:24,840
What should I tell them to be

887
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,840
What should I tell them to

888
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,240
Be like this, you're the only one

889
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,640
If it's a conversation of me

890
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,240
I never know they'd try

891
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,040
I knew what you were like

892
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,440
But we can't come together

893
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,640
But it's over

894
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:51,840
Which has happened to me

895
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:57,840
Which has happened to me

896
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:03,840
Life has happened to me

897
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:10,840
Life has happened to me

898
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:15,840
Life has happened to me

899
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,840
Life has happened to me

900
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,840
