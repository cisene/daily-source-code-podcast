I'm testing his new career.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I know just what I'm trying to do.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Good I can oppose my stupid ass over the ground.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,120
Let's dance taste our tangerine

52
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,220
That's our ch например

53
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:32,700
It's an unpredictable

54
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,840
It's a world-fatable

55
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,420
It's a pomegranate

56
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,720
What a ferocious world

57
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:53,180
Do

58
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,880
You're not running

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
How heavy is that, first?

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Theory and motion.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Wake up.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This is the daily source code episode 360.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
As you can tell from the sound,

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
very different sound today coming to you from

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hyde Park in London.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You can probably hear the den of the traffic in the background.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let me just shut up for a second so you can listen to the sounds of the park.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Can hear some birds.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This is actually a great proof that you can make fun shows,

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
even if you don't have the big ballsy compressor and microphone,

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
etc.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Actually, I'm going to hold the...

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This is the love microphone that I usually carry with me,

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
so I'm going to hold it up in front of my face to give you a little better clarity.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The show is being done like this today.

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Well, stayed in the city last night in London

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
as we have a pretty important announcement tomorrow.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That'll be Wednesday, the 13th.

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Wednesday, the 13th, pretty important announcement here in the UK.

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So I'll be staying here tonight as well.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Well, you know what that means?

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It means I'm on the road.

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Cast blaster is with me and that's all I got.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Now I must say, I have the headphones, the Patricia bought,

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
her headphones, I took those with me and man.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's such a difference to create the show

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
when you're completely encapsulated by the sound,

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
because these really lock off all exterior sound

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and you only hear basically what's coming in.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So I'm going to give you a little bit of a hint of what we're announcing tomorrow.

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll give you a preview of that.

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And of course, plenty of feedback from you guys.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yo, Adam, this is Paige from the sneakart FM podcast.

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I just had to stop and listen to the DSC 459

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
because I just have to say,

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
this is brilliant podcasting.

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This is so nice.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The interview with Ken Clark and stories about the old MTV days.

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yeah, it's just very nice to listen to.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Even though I don't get most of it, you're saying,

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and all the names don't ring any bells for me.

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So here's my profile.

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
32 podcaster being listener for two years,

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
being a podcaster for eight months,

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
due to you and Don and Drew,

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and Folder.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I knew it.

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Oh, man.

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Actually, it just started to drizzle a little bit here in the park.

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So I was sitting on a bench and I've moved underneath the tree.

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Well, let me see if I can use my bag as a backstop there.

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay. Oh, yes.

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Now I can lean back a little bit.

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So I've got droplets on the keyboard.

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Even though I'm under the tree,

117
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
it's getting a little bit heavier here.

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Now what can you do?

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So tomorrow, as I said,

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and I mentioned this,

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I think on yesterday's show as well,

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
there's going to be an announcement for the UK market.

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And of course, I can't tell you,

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I know a lot of you listen one day later,

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
so I can't actually,

126
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
so you'll probably know the news by now

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
if you're listening on a delay,

128
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
which is part of what podcasting's about.

129
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So you'll probably already know what's going on,

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
but I do want to give you just a little bit of a tease.

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I've bleeped out the appropriate name,

132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
so you won't be able to figure out what we're actually announcing,

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
but it is pretty cool.

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Check this out.

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Today, we're announcing that pod share

136
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
are creating a new type of network.

137
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Combining incredible wealth of content

138
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
with the ability for the audience to become part of the show.

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Now with pod share,

140
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
we're combining the power of broadband

141
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
with the technology behind podcasting

142
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
to create tomorrow's network.

143
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
In the process,

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
we want to give our customers the chance

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
to become involved with both an audience

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and as contributors.

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Now, how does that sound?

148
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Does that sound like fun or what?

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Uh-huh.

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Do well on that.

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Well, Parkie checks in.

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Hi, Adam, it's Parkie.

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I was going to win you a Monday to see

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
let you know the results and the experiment I was doing,

155
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
but I just had a very bizarre experience

156
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
in the same experience in Greenwich and London,

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and I just thought I'd run you in a bit early

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and let you know.

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Now, the first part of it was I didn't experiment

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
with this.

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, you know, I'm a folder.

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Everyone knows I'm a folder.

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But I tried this scrunching stuff.

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Ugh!

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Ah!

166
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Now, the one we're going to go into anymore detail

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
but...

168
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Dude, whatever you do,

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
do not attempt scrunching

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
without a trained professional nearby.

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh, yeah!

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Anyway, the weird thing was,

173
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I was in St. Louis

174
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and I'm wondering up and down the aisles

175
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
and I'm listening to today's show

176
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
that's Friday,

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
so early on, Friday came out

178
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
and I was just singing

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
10-4, 10-4, 10-4, 10-4,

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
at moment to myself,

181
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
very quietly,

182
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and a guy just went,

183
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
don't you still scope?

184
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Anyway, I had a little chat with him,

185
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
he's listening up from around here

186
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
to sort of let you know.

187
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Very bizarre experience.

188
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Still a folder.

189
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Always will be a folder.

190
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Bye-bye.

191
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Thank you, Parti.

192
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Wow, interesting.

193
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That is...

194
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What are the chances, huh?

195
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What are the chances

196
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
that you'd be walking through

197
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
the aisles of St. Louis

198
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
singing along.

199
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
10-4, 10-4,

200
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
at moment.

201
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I guess there's something

202
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
to this podcasting stuff after all, huh?

203
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What do veteran broadcasters

204
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
think of podcasters and podcasting?

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Join me, Trucker Tom,

206
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
on Monday, September 18th,

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
for an interview

208
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I did with veteran broadcaster,

209
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Haley Rose.

210
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's where podcasting comes in.

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It allows us,

212
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
allows other people

213
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
to get into the business

214
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
because there's nowhere

215
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
anymore for new people

216
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
to start out

217
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and to be back.

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You have that opportunity, Tom.

219
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I give it to you.

220
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Listen to the perspective of a broadcaster

221
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
who got his start

222
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
in the Golden Age of Radio

223
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
and helped pioneer the genre

224
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
of Talk Radio

225
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
as we know it today.

226
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And I've been in broadcasting

227
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
ever since in one way

228
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
or another,

229
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I've produced television shows

230
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
in the early days of television.

231
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You know, I've been a freelance performer

232
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
for many years.

233
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I do radio,

234
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
television shows.

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I've had my own TV shows,

236
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and I've got my own radio shows.

237
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I've had a very long career.

238
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
On Monday, September 18th,

239
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
find out about UFOs,

240
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
electronic voice phenomena,

241
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
and the unexplained

242
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
at www.truckerTompodcast.com.

243
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You can check out his video cast, too.

244
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
He's doing something that I think is

245
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
just fascinating.

246
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
This is on as I think it's his

247
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
boom, boom, video podcast.

248
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
He tapes

249
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
a certain legs of his journey.

250
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
A trucker Tom, of course,

251
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
being an actual trucker.

252
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And he,

253
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and so he speeds it up

254
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and times it out to fit in with pod safe music.

255
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And I got to tell you,

256
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
it's kind of trippy.

257
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So essentially he's creating music videos.

258
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So you couldn't just subscribe to the feed

259
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
and hear some great pod safe music tunes.

260
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And if you have a video playing device,

261
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
you glance down,

262
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
you check it out.

263
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And you've got some visuals to go along with it.

264
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And sometimes the timing of the turns

265
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
and the road and the traffic patterns

266
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and the flow and he really does speed it up quite a bit.

267
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Coinside with the music in the most eerie way.

268
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Now check that out.

269
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Remember of our pod show network family.

270
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Talker Tom.

271
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Call the D.S.C.

272
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
In the U.S.A.

273
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
That's plus one

274
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
201

275
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
6256357

276
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's plus one

277
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
201

278
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
6256357

279
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
In England

280
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The U.K.

281
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's plus four four

282
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
07

283
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
6853

284
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That's plus four

285
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
4

286
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
2 07

287
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
6853

288
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
If you're a scruncher,

289
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
a boulder

290
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
to fingers or a houlder call now.

291
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What?

292
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What was that?

293
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
A scruncher or a folder?

294
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Wait, let me listen to that again.

295
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
A scruncher folder to fingers or a hold.

296
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Hold on.

297
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Let me check.

298
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Let's see.

299
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What was that here?

300
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Let me rewind that.

301
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
If you're a scruncher,

302
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
a boulder to fingers or a houlder call now.

303
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah.

304
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Keep those voicemail jingles coming in.

305
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I really love them.

306
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Hey Adam.

307
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Nick, you're here.

308
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's from Radio Post Apocalypse.

309
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I just just thought I'd weigh in on the editing debate.

310
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Like you, I don't really edit my show.

311
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's not like I'm aiming for some highly natural sound rating.

312
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm just lazy bastard.

313
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I mean, it's why I'm using cat glasses in the first place, right?

314
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I mean, it allows you to do everything in real time.

315
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You don't need to do any post editing at all.

316
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And it's not that throw that in there.

317
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Later.

318
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
All right, sorry about the sound quality there.

319
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I guess I didn't pull that particular one through my processing.

320
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
When I get it from the voicemail,

321
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
usually it sounds a bit better.

322
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But yeah, you're a lazy cast blastered.

323
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That's what it is.

324
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Users of cast blaster are cast blastered.

325
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Speaking of which,

326
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I want to wind up this whole Joseph Jaffee across the sound thing

327
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
that's been going back and forth.

328
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
For those of you just catch, and this is really ended,

329
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
because, you know, we've had our fun.

330
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
For those of you that haven't been following along very closely,

331
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Joseph Jaffee has a show called Across the Sound.

332
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's a new marketing podcast.

333
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And he interviewed Ron Blumenty,

334
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and he split the interview into two parts.

335
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And after playing part one, he essentially said on the show

336
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
that he was holding part two hostage until I gave him some love

337
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and some traffic and some link love, et cetera, et cetera,

338
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
which I, you know, of course took some offense to.

339
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It was like, hey, dude, you didn't say I had to do that.

340
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So that went back and forth.

341
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And on the most recent episode, I think it's 53 across the sound.

342
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Joseph really lays it all out, and he says it was a joke.

343
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It was intended to be a joke.

344
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
He wasn't serious about it.

345
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Okay, I'm willing to buy that, but of course,

346
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
you know, some punishment has to be dulled out here.

347
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And let me say, I got a whole bunch of interesting,

348
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
interesting punishment suggestions.

349
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Let me see,

350
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
was this newbie, is that newbie, as for Joseph Jaffee,

351
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I say you lock him in a closet and make him listen to the entire

352
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Keith and the girl archives, interesting for sure.

353
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Adam, please be a really great hearted person for give that.

354
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Is that microphone cut?

355
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yeah, I'm gonna change that.

356
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Go.

357
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Okay, sorry about that.

358
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That really sucked ass.

359
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Okay, batteries have been changed.

360
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Oh, I think the sound is even a little bit better.

361
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
All right, let's get back to where we were with Joseph Jaffee.

362
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Let me see, here we go.

363
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Have him do a five minute video on his podcast,

364
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
where he tongues a picture of Phyllis Diller,

365
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
while playing Lawrence,

366
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
well, music in the background,

367
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
wearing a hopping t-shirt.

368
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I think we already did that one.

369
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I didn't like that.

370
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
There were some other suggestions, though,

371
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
check this out.

372
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Hi, Adam.

373
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
This is Karen from Virginia, just casting a vote

374
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
on the punishment.

375
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And I think that the best punishment

376
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
would be to let him listen to a continuous loop

377
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
of that first jingle for the phone numbers.

378
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Actually, the second one is really good.

379
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Thanks for sharing it.

380
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And we'll be now and always have been a folder.

381
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Bye.

382
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh, you almost said scruncher, I could hear it.

383
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah, that may be a little bit too harsh

384
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
to listen to the original voice mail loop.

385
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't think we can make anybody do that.

386
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Hi, Adam. Hi, Joseph.

387
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
This is Rich Gettarsky, a marketing consultant

388
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and podcast producer in Sweden.

389
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I offer you my thoughts on the curry versus Jeffy game.

390
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Just make things clearer.

391
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm a little listener to both of your shows

392
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
and therefore entitled to submit my voice.

393
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
First of all, I and many others,

394
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
oh, you guys so much because you pot father

395
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
and that's Adam,

396
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
hasn't only helped to realize podcasting,

397
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
but also pushed it forward,

398
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
made it respectable and defined

399
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
range of podcasting formats.

400
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And Joseph has done similar,

401
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
sometimes thanks,

402
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
but in more marketing oriented context.

403
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So how can you pay back?

404
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Perhaps a small tribute is by answering

405
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Adam's call for punishment

406
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and to Joseph's quest for it to send

407
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
or not to send question.

408
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm a sweet.

409
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
We're known to be fond of mutual agreement

410
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
and common sense,

411
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
or coolerly stated,

412
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
love peace and understanding.

413
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The key words here should be

414
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
respect and forgive.

415
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
If the whole thing was called by me

416
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
to understandings on one side of the podcast,

417
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
then apologize publicly.

418
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If not, then respect each other's feelings

419
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and forgive the other one.

420
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
There are too many people out there

421
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
punishing each other back and forward.

422
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And if Adam doesn't want Joseph to play

423
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
the second part,

424
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
even though that outcome wasn't agreed on

425
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
beforehand,

426
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
then Joseph should respect Adam's demand.

427
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And guess we all lose a bet

428
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
because it's the second half,

429
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
it's at least the first one

430
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
we still have some good prospects.

431
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And one last thing.

432
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Now it's a few minutes after

433
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
one coffee a.m.

434
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And an hour ago,

435
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I wanted Adam to listen to Joseph's

436
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
latest episode of Across the Sound

437
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and I got this idea to use Skype

438
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
and start a conference with me

439
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and both of your podcasts

440
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
calling lines at the other parties.

441
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So I had to get up to the context

442
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
and do not the PC,

443
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
start Skype and talk.

444
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Hope it worked.

445
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So that both of you guys

446
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
got the same comment at the same time.

447
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Just one pile of things

448
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
to stress the value of my input.

449
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
One word,

450
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
except there's starts with an app.

451
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Folder?

452
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I need chance.

453
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Okay.

454
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah.

455
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Now of course I want Joseph

456
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
to air the second part of the interview.

457
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I thought it was really good.

458
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And he thought it was good too.

459
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But I do have something in mind

460
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
for our friend, Joseph Jaffee.

461
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And this really comes from this entire

462
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
episode he did explaining

463
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
about why he did what he did

464
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
and what he did.

465
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I apologize to his audience,

466
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
my audience,

467
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
me, the world,

468
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
whatever.

469
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
One thing was really funny

470
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
is that he said that when he was

471
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
walking through hallways

472
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
of just around the street

473
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
that people who knew

474
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and would say,

475
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Ben Oberbitch.

476
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I think it's incredibly funny.

477
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So here's the punishment

478
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
that I've come up with

479
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
and we're going to keep it really light.

480
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And this is right in line

481
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
with the Sensei of Vulcan Mind trick.

482
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So I want you to really jam those

483
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
ear buds into your ear

484
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
or if you're listening

485
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
on the computer.

486
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I want you to turn up the sound

487
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
a little bit.

488
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Maybe you should close the door

489
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
first.

490
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So nobody hears you go ahead.

491
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'll give you a second to go

492
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
to get up and go close

493
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
the door to your office

494
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
or wherever you are.

495
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Okay.

496
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Turn the sound up a little bit.

497
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Now,

498
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I want you to close your eyes

499
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
and visualize

500
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
the name Joseph Jaffee.

501
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's a really cool name

502
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
because it starts with two jays

503
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and it has a nice flow

504
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
to it visually Joseph

505
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Jaffee

506
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
with the pH

507
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
and the double F

508
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Joseph Jaffee.

509
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Now

510
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
from now on

511
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
whenever you see the name

512
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
or hear the name

513
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Joseph Jaffee

514
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
you will immediately

515
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
think

516
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
then overbitch

517
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Joseph Jaffee

518
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
then overbitch

519
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Hello

520
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I've lost all

521
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
one of these here

522
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
just calling

523
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Joseph Jaffee

524
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and I'm supposed to call back.

525
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
This is why I haven't

526
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
called lately

527
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
because I'm pretty happy

528
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
with my satellite service.

529
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You see

530
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I got pretty good reception

531
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
but now

532
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm getting

533
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
rather flaky

534
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
reception

535
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I was trying to watch

536
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
some internet

537
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
ponotes

538
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and some regular television

539
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
on

540
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
and

541
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I need

542
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
well, it's not coming

543
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
in the way it was.

544
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So if Uncle Jaffee

545
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
could come have a look at it

546
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
and maybe

547
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
never have

548
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
next door

549
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I really appreciate it

550
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
and

551
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
while you're at it

552
