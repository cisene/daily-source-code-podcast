Delta Sierra Charlie 405.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,320
Mr. Curry, the pod father, forgive this intrusion on such a joyous occasion.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,040
We've come to ask for your blessing.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,760
My name is Ed, and I'm Carlos.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,760
And this is Ed.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,960
We are from a podcast we call the Starcast.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,440
We want to know that we have lived up to your example.

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,120
You boys come to ask my blessing and my daughter's wedding day.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,920
Well, these boys have honored me and my family with your good music.

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,400
You're an interesting bubble and no questions attitude towards what is asked of you.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,240
This honor is the pod father.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,040
In one day, I may come to ask a favor of you.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,040
No kiss the real.

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,040
Thank you father.

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,040
Thank you father.

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,040
Thank you father.

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,640
You were a little lower.

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,280
May your daughter's first child be a masculine child.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,080

Rock-on.

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,400
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped my ass.

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Three minutes?

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,200
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,040
We don't need no sticking friends, man.

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,160
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

31
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,640
Not just in kids to Petroo.

32
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,920
One kid.

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,360
Play that PCB.

34
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,360
Papa!

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,780
athleticmaking,

36
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,320
mac other star.

37
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:49,920
Oh ok,

38
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,300
I got it,

39
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,320
Friday.

40
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,340
me

41
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,440
Hey anger teasing your head.

42
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:03,440
No way, I'll make it my mercy to the grave

43
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,440
Take your dreams to you, catch the things

44
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,440
These are aging on both sides of faith

45
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,440
Love is only a medium, they look at me there

46
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,440
Cloth is ever changing, hope is shining in my eyes

47
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

48
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,440
And then we'll hold me still and stand by my mind

49
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,440
In the middle of the last time to burn

50
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,440
And then we'll hold me clean and take you home

51
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,440
But I want to be to love you

52
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,440
Love is only a medium, they look at me there

53
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,440
Cloth is ever changing, hope is shining

54
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,440
Love is only a medium, they look at me there

55
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:11,440
Cloth is ever changing, hope is shining in my eyes

56
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,440
I hope is shining in my eyes

57
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,440
Love is only a medium, they look at me there

58
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:40,440
Cloth is ever changing, hope is shining in my eyes

59
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,440
So, I hope is shining in my eyes

60
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,440
No way, I'll make it my mercy to the grave

61
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Love is only a medium, they look at me there

62
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:02,440
Cloth is ever changing, hope is shining in my eyes

63
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,440
Love is only a medium, they look at me there

64
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:12,440
Cloth is ever changing, hope is shining in my eyes

65
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:19,440
Cloth is ever changing, hope is shining in my eyes

66
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,440
Cloth is ever changing, hope is shining in my eyes

67
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,440
Yeah, hope is shining in my eyes

68
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,440
Love is only a medium, they look at me there

69
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,440
Cloth is ever changing, hope is shining in my eyes

70
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,440
Oh yeah, that'll wake you up to fear of us

71
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,440
Esperanza coming to you from San Francisco

72
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,440
Very sunny northern California, hey everybody how you're doing is the Daily Source Code today

73
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,440
It's Friday

74
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,440
Man, I'm ready for the show, I'm ready to rumble

75
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:03,440
Lots of positive music for you today, lots of feedback, all kinds of stuff that I've been saving up for the end of the week

76
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,440
And you know, I woke up this morning, actually I did normally I wake up before the alarm clock

77
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,440
So it went off at 6 o'clock and I'm like, hey, I'm really tired

78
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Why am I so tired, I went to bed at 10.30

79
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,440
I know why, I've been traveling a lot

80
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,440
You know what I would say, I arrive a Monday, I went straight to the office

81
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,440
And I've just been nonstop since then, I think I'm ready for the weekend

82
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
How about you?

83
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,440
Some of you may be listening to this on your way home

84
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,440
If you're in the UK, you probably got it around 5 in the afternoon

85
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,440
Some of you in the west coast, you're probably getting this early morning

86
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,440
I may be you're 11 o'clock meeting if you're on the east coast in the US

87
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,440
And if you're in Australia?

88
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,440
Well, how is Saturday?

89
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,440
I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired

90
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,440
I know, I know, I know

91
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,440
It is the month of a month of the show

92
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,440
Hello, hello

93
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,440
Happy Friday, Charlie France

94
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,440
This is Ray from Holland with a little sucker update

95
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,440
Because not only Holland is orange, the whole world is getting a little orange

96
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,440
And that's a lot better than the Greengrassi Marijuana color refining up to

97
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,440
Everywhere I come and I tell that I'm from the Netherlands

98
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,440
People always start to talk about the coffee shops

99
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:28,440
Anyway, today at 1,800 hours European time in Stuttgart, Germany

100
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,440
The World Cup match Holland against Ivory Coast will kick off

101
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,440
Actually, I'm not such a big sucker fan, but I really like to watch all the World Cup matches

102
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,440
As much as I can

103
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,440
Tonight, our Dutch coach Marco von Buster will start with the same 11 as last Sunday

104
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,440
That means that Raphael von der Fart won't play

105
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,440
But, Wesley Snyder will be in the center of the field again

106
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,440
I hope Rut van Nieselroy, show off a little more

107
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,440
And Aryan Robwe will play with his 10 friends on the field

108
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,440
Every coach coach Henry Mitchell has a knife on his throat

109
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,440
They have to win this game

110
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,440
I think the World will beat more orange at the tonight

111
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,440
And I don't underestimate the gang, but they're going to be spanked

112
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,440
By the Italian Big Swinging Dig

113
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,440
I'm sorry, pal, but the 11 girls from the States are not going to win the World Cup

114
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,440
Anyway, hope you have a wonderful weekend

115
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,440
See you soon

116
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,440
Bye-bye

117
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Hey Ray

118
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,440
I'm fighting words, man

119
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
What are you talking about?

120
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,440
The 11 girls from the States give me a break

121
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,440
I have a really good feeling about him

122
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,440
And tomorrow a couple of the enthusiasts from Pod Show HQ

123
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
We're all getting together

124
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
We're going to watch that game

125
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
They have a shot

126
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,440
I know they do, and they just had to kind of get into the whole vibe

127
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,440
So funny that all this World Cup stuff is going on

128
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,440
For me, in my limited little world of Pod casting

129
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,440
But there's a whole other championship going on as well

130
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,440
Which is the NBA finals

131
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
Vasca Ball here in the States

132
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,440
And it's funny because I really didn't know about it

133
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,440
Until last night Ron said, hey man, come on, come on

134
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,440
Come on, my place will have dinner there

135
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,440
Of course, we had to take cabs

136
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,440
Since the Trinity option was out

137
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,440
Trinity is at the doctor by the way

138
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,440
She'll be okay

139
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,440
Today we get full diagnosis and cost structure

140
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,440
But I'm getting her fixed no matter what

141
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
I love my Trinity

142
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
If you're new to this show, Trinity is my

143
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,440
French-Fri-Oil Burnin

144
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,440
Mercedes station wagon 300 turbo diesel from 1984

145
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,440
That dropped her transmission

146
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
So we actually watched the heat gain

147
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,440
He'd against the Mavericks, Miami versus Dallas

148
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
It was a good game

149
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Finally, Miami actually played a really good game

150
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
It was alright, you know?

151
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,440
It's funny because once you, I don't know

152
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,440
This is kind of hard

153
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,440
Something about soccer, even though you get relatively low points

154
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,440
It seems to be so much less structure to the game

155
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
How things can happen

156
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,440
And for some reason with basketball, it seems like

157
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,440
It really is based a lot on the tech

158
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,440
You see in soccer, you're not supposed to follow the guy

159
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,440
And of course, you know, they're always trying to do something

160
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,440
To knock someone down without getting a yellow or red card

161
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,440
When basketball, this filing thing is really important

162
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Because then you get your free throws

163
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
I don't know, for some reason

164
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,440
It just didn't quite hit me as I thought it would

165
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,440
I don't know, what is happening to me?

166
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,440
I'm turning into a European, gosh, dang it

167
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
Like in that soccer stuff

168
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
Hey, voicemail numbers all weekend long

169
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
You may be listening to the show over the weekend

170
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,440
I'd love to hear from you, we have two numbers

171
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,440
In New Jersey, 201, 65, 65, 7

172
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,440
And I have a number in London

173
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,440
So whichever is cheaper for you to call, feel free

174
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,440
020, 768, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3

175
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,440
Some cool news yesterday, some pod show news

176
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,440
Pod cast Ali is now featured on the new Nokia phones

177
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,440
They have some kind of pod catcher aggregator built in

178
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,440
And you can, you can now search through

179
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,440
portions of the pod cast Ali directory

180
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
And it will download stuff automatically

181
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
I posted it on curry.com

182
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
So it's definitely cool

183
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
And pretty proud of that

184
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,440
It's all part of the evil master plan

185
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,440
As we unveil pod show plus

186
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,440
And the pod cast Ali Renett, where my friends

187
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,440
I've met him, I've just had to ring

188
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,440
You know, I'm looking to last Friday

189
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
So to 402

190
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,440
I'll have to say, London in the summer time

191
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Yeah

192
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
You know, I'll say, oh my god

193
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,440
You should sit in so close square

194
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
On a weekday

195
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Around about lunchtime

196
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
When all the secretary is coming out

197
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Hosing the skirts up

198
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,440
Mumbling the tops down

199
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Oh yes

200
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,440
Oh yes

201
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
Hang on second

202
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,440
You shouldn't really put this on a

203
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,440
They're talking about

204
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,440
Lockup pose

205
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
Anyway

206
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
I'm sorry, well I say

207
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
Hello Adam

208
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
Renett here

209
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
I can tell you

210
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,440
No wait

211
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,440
I am a fuck you

212
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
I didn't get it

213
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
I am a fuck

214
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
I am a fuck

215
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
I am a fuck

216
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
I'm a fuck

217
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
I'm a fuck

218
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,440
Okay

219
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Thank you

220
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
There you go

221
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
It's all one guy apparently

222
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Oh man

223
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
Yeah

224
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,440
I mean please don't don't think that we're opening up a London office to do any business

225
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
We're just there for the boobies in the summertime

226
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Failure to comply radio

227
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
A show where we make you laugh

228
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,440
Cry and touch you in that special way

229
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,440
Or maybe just laugh

230
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
From conspiracy theories

231
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,440
To throwing Katie Holmes into a ghetto

232
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
This show has it all

233
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,440
We're random

234
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,440
We're retarded and guess what

235
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,440
We're politically incorrect

236
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,440
It's failure to comply radio

237
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,440
Visit us at www.ftcradio.net

238
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,440
Hi

239
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
This is Caitlin Smith

240
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,440
And you're listening to the daily source code with your benevolent host

241
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,440
The podfather himself

242
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,440
A guy with really great hair

243
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Adam Kern

244
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,440
Straight out of my mind

245
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,440
It's spinning around

246
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,440
What?

247
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
Simple things

248
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,440
That don't matter at all

249
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,440
And I get a share of them

250
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,440
It's my destruction

251
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,440
And sometimes I get so dizzy

252
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,440
And then for

253
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
All the smoke

254
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,440
I've been heard

255
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
Raves for you

256
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,440
Like many times before

257
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,440
It's difficult to see

258
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
The melodies

259
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,440
Cook the eyes

260
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,440
Like enough nice to welcome

261
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,440
Here in my eyes and you

262
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,440
Let's kill me

263
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:39,440
Can you hear me?

264
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,440
Will you please follow me

265
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,440
Can you hear me?

266
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,440
Can you hear me?

267
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,440
Will you hear me?

268
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:04,440
Will you hear me?

269
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,440
Like when do you've carried me

270
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,440
To a better place

271
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
Can you hear me?

272
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
That I'm here

273
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,440
I understand it

274
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,440
My mind has constant love

275
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,440
I love that feeling

276
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,440
When you've slept with me

277
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,440
Can you hear me?

278
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,440
Will you hear me?

279
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Will you hear me?

280
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,440
Will you hear me?

281
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,440
Will you hear me?

282
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:04,440
Will you hear me?

283
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,440
Will you hear me?

284
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,440
Does this affect you?

285
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,740
Hey

286
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,740
hmm

287
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,520
it all

288
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,300
cause

289
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,900
here

290
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,180
coming

291
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,880
is

292
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,880
from

293
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:43,200
Katelyn Smith from the Podsafe Music Network and here me let me just check out her

294
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,440
bio for a second here. Oh, she's cute. Something magical happens. I read from

295
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,240
the bio when she grabs a guitar and steps up to the microphone. Coffee

296
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,360
shots become silence. Loud band loving teens turn quiet. Adults turn an

297
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,160
ear to the obvious gift and embrace all that this artist has to give. It

298
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,520
may be your confidence or the heartfelt expression of her music. It's

299
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,600
Katelyn Smith from Minnesota. Cool. Like it. Who are you? Oh, this is

300
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,160
kind of cool. Her influences. Jewel. Nicole Nordman and then this is cool.

301
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,960
Beth Thorne Lee and the Bitties. Excellent. Very, very cool. So Podsafe Music

302
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,560
artists influencing her. I like that very much. And people ask me all the

303
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,760
time. How may I? How can we get our song played on the daily source code? Well,

304
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,360
really is he one. I have to like the song. It's just that's sorry. It's my

305
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,560
show. I don't care. I have to like the song. And I like a wide range of

306
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:39,480
stuff. Two, it's always does help when when the artist cuts a promo. And

307
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,360
this was even pre mix. It came to me in all one pre mix form. And of

308
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,520
course, at the end of the day, naked pictures also help. I had him. This is

309
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,800
the Higgins from the editing dot com photo cast. Just listening to

310
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,000
that. But for a four and you play the comment about the guy from the Euro

311
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,880
star. Excuse me. And then licensing Podsafe Music for their commercial

312
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,760
podcast that they're producing. And I was wondering if you could talk a little

313
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,120
bit about where does the line get drawn for a commercial podcast? And we have

314
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,600
a lot of podcasts. There's out there that are looking at or have already

315
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,880
quit their day jobs. And they're collecting income from their podcast. And

316
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:30,520
some of them do play Podsafe Music. So what's, you know, what, where does the

317
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:36,600
definition fall of commercial podcast? I'm sure it's in the license. But in the

318
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,200
terms of agreeing to it. But, you know, well, it's a computer guy. I'm trying to

319
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,480
just click except on the terms of whatever software I'm looking at. So yeah.

320
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,680
And please, you can talk a little bit about that. And thanks a lot. And if you're

321
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,840
for talking for out there, check out Editing dot com. Thanks. Bye bye.

322
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,320
Right on it. It's real simple. Actually, I'm glad you asked the question. It's about

323
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,920
the distribution. So this is really for podcasters. If you make a podcast, which

324
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,400
they call it a derivative work or whatever the legal term is that you click the

325
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,280
way the minute you signed up, you know, that's okay. And it can be commercial. I mean,

326
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,920
witness the daily source code, totally a commercial, a commercial show. Go daddy.com,

327
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,560
DSC three upon checkout for your domain name for $6.95. But if you were to burn this to

328
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:26,160
a CD and distribute it to clients for a fee, which is the case of the euro star, well,

329
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,760
then you have to go and get permission because now you're doing something else

330
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,440
with it as that the license intends. And I think that's pretty much not also commercial

331
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,400
clients often. They want to compensate. And I think that's kind of what was going on

332
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,080
here. There was an agency working for the client for euro star. There's podcasts that

333
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:51,200
were being developed. They may or may not be if they're internal podcasts only, then the

334
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,680
same thing would kick in because then it's, it's not a public work and you have to give

335
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,080
all the attribution. So really, it's about the distribution. But if you're just, if you're

336
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,080
quitting your day job, if you're quit your day job, if you want to quit your day job,

337
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,560
you just want to make a show. And you're making money by doing your show. It's not a

338
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,280
problem as long as you're signed up to the podcast music and the network. And of course,

339
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,400
you have to report back in. You just want to think about all the music. You know, I really

340
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,040
do like playing all different types of tunes along Fridays. I do like to kick it a little

341
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:28,560
bit. Was it? Have you ever heard that in over your head, Julian Smith? So he's noticed

342
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,200
that I've been picking up on some R&B and hip-hop stuff. And I think I saw on his one of

343
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,200
his show notes that he was happy that I was coming out of the closet. As a closet, as

344
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:45,360
a closet dancer, a closet hip hopper, R&B, you're not alone, Julian. Hey Adam, this is Jeff

345
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,360
Hines. We're riding that dance party podcast. I'm glad you're finally coming out of the

346
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,640
closet. Forget all that head, bangers, ball, bowls, shit. And who cares about a mallet? I mean,

347
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,600
does anyone look good to mallet? I know I don't. You look good to mallet, Adam. So it's

348
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,200
all about dancing. It's all about shaking your ass. Adam, what kind of ass do you have?

349
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,800
Is it round? Is it square? Is it fat? Is it thin? Is it loose? Is it tight? You know,

350
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,040
you like to get it like that? I'm fine. So I'm glad to see that you're finally playing some

351
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:21,480
dance music on the PSC that people can shake it and make it to. And that's what it's all

352
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,440
about. So this is Jeff Hines with a Friday dance party. And all I have to say is keep on

353
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,440
dancing.

354
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,200
What to come over here and see what kind of ass I have, man? If you're that interested. So it's

355
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,120
Friday. Normally, I'd be doing pod save the queen with Christina. It's time for episode

356
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:44,440
number three. Of course, I'm not home. And she is, or I mean, our other home as it were. She

357
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:51,640
really wants to do the show. And of course, I want her to do the show as well. And I am, I guess,

358
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:58,840
I'm the producer. So we have figured something out, hopefully, but it won't be today, because

359
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,520
it's just all the time zone stuff. Because what time is it now? It's already deep into the

360
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,400
afternoon. And I have to get off to the office after I'm done with the with Charlie. So it'll be

361
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,920
over the weekend, but we're going to try and do advice Skype. She's going to email me the songs.

362
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:19,160
And I think with the new Skype, the PC version, at least, as you know, I'm still on windows.

363
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,720
And she has windows as well. I think the the sound quality just might be good enough to actually

364
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,280
pull it all together and pull off a pod save the queen. I can't wait to hear what she has lined up for

365
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,320
obviously. Adam, hey, Moose Lawrenceville, California. Sorry to hear about Trinity's transmission,

366
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:43,560
but hearing Christina's podcast, which I really enjoyed, the thing that comes to mind is for the

367
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:49,400
last, though, longest time that I can remember, you've been kind of complaining about not having

368
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:55,640
a producer. And well, long behold, you're a producer for your daughter. And you're doing a great job

369
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:05,240
and so she so cheers. Hi, Adam. This is Chris and take us down there. I like to hear you play

370
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,760
straight by super thrown through. I think you guys will need to get some close going on. Thanks.

371
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:18,200
Bye. Wow. Your wish to my command. Only with the music heavy. Straight on the Charlie.

372
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:33,480
I have described nothing but black and I'm afraid, still I am dying to tell you.

373
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:41,320
Great. You're into the room. Make a mistake. Let's see, just how much it hurts you.

374
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:56,760
I'd like to crack. I can't be alone. Always a pack and they're just at danger by now.

375
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:04,520
I can't be alone. Always a pack and they're just at danger by now.

376
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:31,880
Show me the way to the perfect one where you're so far. I might seem angry to mingle about myself

377
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:43,160
while. Show me the way to the perfect one where you're so far.

378
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:17,800
There's a pack and they're just at danger by now. Great. Nothing black and I'm afraid, still I am dying to tell you.

379
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:39,240
The super thrown straight. Those of you listening to us on serious stars 102. The satellite window

380
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:45,000
is a closing PCH next and I will see you guys back here on Monday. Source code listeners, we continue

381
00:24:45,000 --> 00:25:00,680
now on the show. Tagtabbit. Almost had it perfectly back time. I don't know what went wrong.

382
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:07,880
I'm using the new version of Cas Blaster by the way. It's kind of cool. Cas Blaster Mike heard me talking

383
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:14,200
yesterday about ID3 tags and not being able to see those in Cas Blaster. He turned around last night

384
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:24,840
or whatever and made me a new version. When I mouse over, I mouse over scraped. Of course not all songs

385
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:33,480
have ID3 tags. There we go. Some of them are working. Although I noticed one thing for some reason

386
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:41,080
my F1, which is my AC to the future. If I hit that, it doesn't do anything. All the other F commands

387
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:48,120
start stuff like the thing out of the Friday. I've got the metro moment, but when I hit F1,

388
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,000
it doesn't happen. So I don't know if that's a change in Cas Blaster, Mike or if that's something

389
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,120
that's changed on my machine. Super thrown. Of course by requesting a hamster, it's fastest rising

390
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:04,680
band formed in the C-coasteria by Brothers Kobe and Kerry Dodd, who added basis Adam Hor and percussionist

391
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,640
Travis Barton. The band has performed throughout the Northeast and opened for such acts as Vince

392
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:15,800
Wellnick, of the grateful dead and Todd Rungren and Gary Hoey. He, Gary Hoey is playing

393
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:21,400
tonight, everybody. Alright, I still have one more song. I got so many cool things I want to share

394
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:29,240
with you. Yesterday K2 Kevin Rady asked about Snake Bite, which is the mixture of cider and

395
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:35,240
ale, I guess, in the UK, which he thought was outlawed and he really had a legitimate question.

396
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,920
So he asked that by calling to the voicemail numbers, and of course we have an answer already.

397
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,320
Hello Adam, Mike Turner, from Bristol, England, currently working in Chelmum,

398
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:52,360
also known as GEM Indicator, one second life. He'll comment, Snake Bite's eye, Charlie 404.

399
00:26:52,360 --> 00:27:00,280
Snake Bite is actually perfectly legal in England, although some pubs won't actually serve it,

400
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:05,800
because apparently it doesn't make people a lot more pissed, a lot quicker. I don't think it does,

401
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:11,400
actually. The thing is just another legend. Anyway, what you say is beer. We brew it's actually

402
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:19,960
called ale or bitter. Now, to make a snake bite, cider is normally mixed with larga, what called

403
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,800
larga, which would be both lids or fosters, or current bugs, something like that, which is the

404
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:34,200
under beer. You would never mix cider with ale or bitter. Also, that other bloke, I'm not too

405
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:40,600
sure. The one who criticizes me will show your sound and how to run it, but I think he's an asshole.

406
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,080
And I agree with you. I mean, who would tell GEM Indicator's guitar sounded distorted and he should

407
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,400
turn the distortion off. Anyway, just for now. All right.

408
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:54,120
All right, man. Thank you. Okay, so we've settled that. I think it's time for a sound seeing tour

409
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,600
of snake bite in the UK. You know, I still have not actually, you know, you have to have your own

410
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,800
pub. I think it's kind of like the an unwritten law in the UK. And that's the pub where you're going

411
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:09,480
hang out. I have not chosen one. And I really do need to do that. So perhaps a sound seeing tour

412
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,880
and believe me, lots of people have sent me pub rules and, you know, when you're supposed to buy a

413
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,080
drink or accept a drink and how you're supposed to strike up a conversation, there is a several

414
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,720
rule books on all this. How to do it properly. But it seems to me like it's time for a sound

415
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,400
seeing tour of snake bite. Maybe a snake bite or two. Interesting discussion going on over

416
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:37,640
curry.com as of turned on the comments again. It seems like the comic strip blogger and

417
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,600
jacic watcher stuff is all calm down. And if it starts up again, I'm just deleting comments. I'm

418
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:48,440
so sick and tired of that. Can we all just get along? But the comments now are about the Earth

419
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,760
Link ad challenge that we've been running. And this is pretty cool because this is where you get to

420
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:58,440
make the advertising. And of course, just listening to all these different submissions is by definition

421
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,000
advertising, but I look at it as content for the show. And so there's people who're saying,

422
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,200
oh, you know, this one sucks and that was no good. It's just like mainstream radio. But the

423
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,920
whole point of this is, then why don't you just send in your own submissions? So you should tell us

424
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:18,920
how it's supposed to go. How it's supposed to work? What will work? Ad challenge.podshow.com

425
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,600
I got another submission for you today. They are getting very good. I think we're seeing like 20

426
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,240
new ones a day come in. And this is for valuable cash prizes, $2,000 in prize money.

427
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:37,320
We're doing the earthly clues. That's right, baby. Earth Link, bombastic broadband.

428
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:45,720
Delicious, darling. That's Earth Link. Ethnic comes home to you and brings it home to mama.

429
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:52,760
That's our sister. That's what I'm talking about. In Earth Link, we'll help you out with all your

430
00:29:52,760 --> 00:30:00,280
internet needs. It's just go to EarthLink.com. Let them know that papa sits here. Yeah, that's

431
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:11,160
it. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah. All right. So this week and I get something to go

432
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:16,760
look for a table and some other solution for the studio because it's really gotten bad now.

433
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,960
I should take a picture of this. You know what? Hold on a second. We'll do just that.

434
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:29,800
So I've got everything off of the Tashiba laptop show notes, rundown my playlist from music,

435
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:35,640
cast blaster. But as you know, I've told you about this. It's all in the kitchen. That's where

436
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,840
it's all set up. And it's just way too low for me. So I have a roller bag, which when you roll on

437
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,240
take the airplane, you can put in the overhead bin. And so the laptops on top of that. Now the

438
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:51,720
microphone, I only have a really small stand, a portable stand with a heavy foot. And I just

439
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:58,200
snapped the high LPR 40 in there. But since it's so low, I've taken a candlestick.

440
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,400
And let me take a picture of this. You won't believe it unless I tell you how long. Let's see if I

441
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:09,640
get the whole thing in the shot here. There we go. Oh, wait. I want to get the microphone. This is not

442
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:15,880
easy. Getting the whole whole thing in the shot. There we go. Let's take a picture. Let's try one

443
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:22,840
just for the picture. There we go. I think we'll get a kick out of that. I'll post that in the

444
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:29,960
show notes somewhere. Link to a flicker page. Okay. I had one more song lined up. I know I know I

445
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:38,040
want to play it because I really like it. What is this Antonio Bastion from Spain? Let me see

446
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:50,600
lead singer in Frogmouth, Labuelet, Muff. And Bastolich duo Antonio Antonio Antonio Antonio Antonio,

447
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:57,960
Antonio Bastion's best. Antonio Bastion's voice, harmonica are his signature. Currently working on

448
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,800
his label and first solo album, new site coming soon. Excellent. Link to all that goodness in the

449
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:09,240
show notes. Let's check out Don't Break it. I think you will enjoy it. Oh, I remember.

450
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:15,800
Georgie Todd sent me this one. Yes, funny. You don't need to be on the radio, my friend. Stick with us

451
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,760
podcasters.

452
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:47,320
I don't care about the fame and glory. Just pay my song on the radio. I don't need much

453
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:53,800
never. I don't have a Rolex or a caseload. Give me a chance. Let the public decide.

454
00:32:53,800 --> 00:33:02,040
Play my video long time. I don't have a thing behind. Just want my chance. Is it a crime?

455
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:07,320
What must I do? To get on the radio? I'll message it above but I know to the low.

456
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,600
What's on my paints? But I can dance. Please, Mr. Radio, give me a chance.

457
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:18,040

What's on my paints? But I can dance. Please, Mr. Radio, give me a chance.

459
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,760
Three or four plays in the day. I'm not asking for the moon.

460
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:35,800
In review me, I got things to say. A brand new LP come in soon. If you're septic and you're

461
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:42,040
critic, don't take my music in the first degree. If my music gives you steady,

462
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:49,240
it's my soul. Don't you agree? On my side you get on the radio. I'll message it above but I know

463
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:55,320
to the low. What's on my paints? But I can dance. Please, Mr. Radio, give me a chance.

What's on my paints? But I can dance. Please, Mr. Radio, give me a chance.

466
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:11,000
Like a pit bull, I will never let go. Went to the critics come to my show.

467
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,760
All publicity is good publicity. They're opinion will never harm me.

468
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:24,760
I will always do my thing. Leave my heart dancing. If you don't like it, don't buy it.

469
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:30,040
If you don't buy it, don't break it. What must I do? To get on the radio?

00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,160
But I can dance. Please, Mr. Radio, give me a chance.

485
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,600
Please, Mr. Radio, give me a chance. I do it forget about it.

486
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,720
I think I need to give you no chance. Please, Mr. Radio, give me a chance.

487
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,680
Alright. Please, Mr. Radio, give me a chance.

488
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,680
Please, Mr. Radio, give me a chance. Thanks for sharing your stuff, man.

489
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,480
Potset music, network links and the show notes.

490
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,120
You know, this has been one of the first shows ever, I think, where we haven't had a Senseo moment.

491
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,960
I don't know what's going on. Maybe it was, I had a great dinner last. I marked a cooked.

492
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:38,120
It was really nice. So, this is like no Senseo stuff going on. No gastronomic intentions.

493
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,320
Okay, I'm looking forward to resting up this weekend. Chillin' out, as I said,

494
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,480
we'll be trying to do a pod save the queen with Christina.

495
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,560
But of course, we'll be back here Monday. We got a whole, another week of stuff that we're

496
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,600
doing here at Pod Show. I'll keep you up to speed on that. My stuff slowly starts to become available.

497
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,400
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm so ready and so tired. And you know what, there's a whole, there's about 50

498
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,760
people at the office who are also pretty damn tired and they're working really hard.

499
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,840
Okay, adamacroid.com, dailysourcecode.com is where you can find the feed and the latest episodes.

500
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,560
Have a great weekend, everybody, for 20 C a Monday.

501
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:29,880

502
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:36,120
