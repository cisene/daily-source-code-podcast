Delta Sierra Charlie.

462.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Sometimes an atoms on a loan.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He needs his love right there on the microphone.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So here she is, yes, the Lady Patricia.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The say to have some better than one.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And with his angel from above.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There's nothing that they both can't do.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
A make you wild as dreams come true.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So grab your ear buds and jam them up.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And let the fabulous show begin.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's Adam and Patricia.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes, Adam and Patricia.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Adam and Lady Patricia.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There's one pet.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I love to pet.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And every evening we get set eyes broken.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Every chance I get is my ghost pussy.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Never scampers, never hurts.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But I love the true sisters.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And it's so cheap because it's hers.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's my girl's pussy.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sometimes it goes out at night to return.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The break of dawn.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
No matter what the weather's like.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's always nice and warm.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Always neat and always clean.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Never bossing, never mean.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Works just like a clean machine.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's my girl's pussy.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
All right.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's see.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Come to daddy now.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's it.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What do you say to me?

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Me?

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What I like to hear.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Listen.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I got something to say to you too.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Me?

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It goes like this.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You like it?

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah.

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I thought you would.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Listen.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
One more thing to tell you.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
No.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Sometimes it goes out at night to return.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The break of dawn.

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No matter what the weather's like.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's always nice and warm.

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Never skimpers, never puzzled.

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But I like the thrills it's does.

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And it's so cheap because it's hers.

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's my girl's pussy.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Mm-hmm.

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What is it with your guys?

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
No.

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This was.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Hi, everybody.

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That was Ian Whitcom.

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Of story.

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Hey.

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
In UK.

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This is a classic bit.

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This is my girl's pussy.

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah.

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Sent to me by Marcus County of the Seenzine.

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It is a wonderful song.

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah.

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's a nice warm wonderful song.

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes, it is.

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let me see.

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm looking at it.

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
This is at his website.

84
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What is it?

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It says America's, huh?

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
America's foremost teen pan alley man.

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You could layly virtue also.

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Grammy award winning recording artists.

89
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Ian Whitcom.

91
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm American from Surrey.

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I was probably an American record company.

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm American record company.

94
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I mean, he's American, right?

95
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh, I want, oh, okay.

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay.

97
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You got it?

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah.

99
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He's been making songs for a long time.

100
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah.

101
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I think I guess they re releasing this re releasing his songs.

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay.

103
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What is a very funny song?

104
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah, it's cool.

105
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Hey, everybody.

106
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's.

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Friday.

108
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You know, football Friday, right?

109
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Maybe.

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
No.

111
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No.

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I want you to just.

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Why?

114
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I want you to talk more.

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's taking my mouth right now.

116
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Very good.

117
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No, what you did.

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah.

119
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Well, that's how people at home can hear you.

120
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay.

121
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I was going to say it's a 462 is the episode.

122
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We're at the Curry Cottage.

123
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Football F U B A R.

124
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Football Boy.

125
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
No, that's F O O B R.

126
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
F U B A R.

127
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah.

128
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Is an engineering term.

129
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay.

130
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Fucked up beyond all recognition.

131
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh, that's sort of a Friday.

132
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And that's kind of what this Friday is from the Friday.

133
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
All right.

134
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So tired.

135
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But you are tired.

136
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah.

137
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I can see that.

138
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah.

139
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I know.

140
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
How can Bloom still be walking around?

141
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't know.

142
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
How can he actually, I mean, he's 50.

143
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He's a bit younger than I am.

144
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
4?

145
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Not 5.

146
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
4?

147
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
How does he do it?

148
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
How does he do it, man?

149
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't know.

150
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Although they told me last night we had.

151
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So we've been in London almost all of this week.

152
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Of course.

153
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We announced our partnership with the BTBTpot Show.com.

154
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And so that was what was that Wednesday?

155
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yeah.

156
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
No.

157
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Tuesday.

158
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No Wednesday.

159
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It was Wednesday.

160
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay.

161
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Remember.

162
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And so I came home because I had to record stuff and do all that.

163
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And everyone went out to dinner.

164
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I told me that Ron looks pretty wrecked.

165
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I told him he could be good there.

166
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He is also young in life.

167
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh, man.

168
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah.

169
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm glad I know.

170
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm glad I don't have that problem.

171
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That situation is better to have an older woman.

172
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You're now.

173
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What do you mean?

174
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't know.

175
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He seems to be doing fine.

176
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I don't know about that.

177
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah.

178
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah.

179
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah.

180
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But underneath you don't know that.

181
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He must be very tired.

182
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Oh, yeah.

183
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Of course he's tired.

184
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But in good spirit.

185
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Of course.

186
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This has been the fantastic week.

187
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We've had a great.

188
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You know, we saw we opened up BTpodshow.com and people can submit their songs or or pictures or whatever they have.

189
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Video audio podcast doesn't matter.

190
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
There's like.

191
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
There was 500.

192
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Exciting.

193
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The first day.

194
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And it's something some really amazing shit.

195
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I think you'll really, really like it when I show it to you.

196
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Adam, it's a little strategy in Cleveland.com.

197
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Listening to daily source code number 447 and hearing poor pictures.

198
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Nothing with your ear buds.

199
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And I challenge you.

200
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Today's September 12th 2006 to go online and replace.

201
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Patricia's headphones that you snagged from her.

202
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah.

203
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah.

204
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Thank you.

205
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's not even.

206
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Absolutely right.

207
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Because they're one size.

208
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Can I just ask you something?

209
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
One size fits old.

210
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Not me.

211
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What the ear buds?

212
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah.

213
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The official iPod ear buds.

214
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I know.

215
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It doesn't fit my ear.

216
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
No.

217
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Your hole is too small.

218
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Your holes are too small.

219
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Uh-huh.

220
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Had to get you back for the mouth.

221
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah.

222
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But if I give you a pair of headphones like this.

223
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
If I go back and give you yours back.

224
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We actually wear them with your hair.

225
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Are you going to do like an abyss?

226
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I care.

227
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't know.

228
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And the hair wasn't that good.

229
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That was the the wrongest thing in recording history and music video history.

230
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And it looks very insecure.

231
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I think.

232
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You know what I think?

233
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What should we do?

234
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Do you want to give anything you want to talk about?

235
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I have my got all kinds of stuff.

236
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Well, no.

237
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I was just reading the papers.

238
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah.

239
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
One more thing to worry about.

240
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Well, we're messing away.

241
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Like, oh, you're just figuring this one out.

242
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This is Al Gore's movie.

243
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Of course.

244
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We know that with the global warming and Al Gore is doing great job.

245
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The great job.

246
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Reminding us.

247
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Somebody has to do it.

248
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But um, and if you read it, you think it's scary, actually.

249
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You know.

250
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So what have you done to protect our planet?

251
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What do you want me to do?

252
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, what does Al want you to do?

253
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Did you read his book?

254
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
No.

255
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Did you see his movie?

256
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
No.

257
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
His movie opens today in the UK.

258
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But I'm a good girl.

259
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I always do everything right.

260
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You said.

261
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You said one more thing to worry about.

262
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I didn't spray that hair spray anymore.

263
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No.

264
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
No, they fixed that a long time ago.

265
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah.

266
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So that's that's done.

267
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I heard that that's okay.

268
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And what else can I do?

269
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Tell me.

270
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I think since the reason you're seeing Al Gore and all the papers today is because

271
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
the movie opens is an inconvenient truth.

272
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Do you want to go see it?

273
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yeah.

274
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That would help.

275
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Didn't you see it in?

276
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Remember it was at 7 a.m.

277
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah.

278
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh, you had your eyes closed.

279
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah.

280
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It was 7 a.m. in Monterey, California.

281
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah.

282
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But I heard it was actually very interesting.

283
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Well, it's a big hit.

284
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The movie.

285
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Lots of people are going to see it.

286
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yeah.

287
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I also have the book.

288
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Did you read the book that we brought back with?

289
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No.

290
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Did you see me reading the book?

291
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
No.

292
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
No.

293
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Just wanted to put you on.

294
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I was making your shakes.

295
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah.

296
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You're here to get you in shakes.

297
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Excuse me.

298
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We had this conversation last night.

299
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah.

300
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm taking care of you.

301
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You know?

302
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Excuse.

303
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh, man.

304
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Like you said, that's the only thing you do.

305
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Well, there's no more time in the day to read a book.

306
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You're never on the computer.

307
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You're never surfing around.

308
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah.

309
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And it's a bit a little bit.

310
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah.

311
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's quite a job to keep you in upright position.

312
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You know, in upright.

313
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And what is that?

314
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Please fold you.

315
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Put your trade to tell you tables in the upright and stored position.

316
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's what it is.

317
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Please put your husband in the upright and stored position.

318
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah.

319
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Good morning.

320
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Time to do it.

321
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Make more doughnuts.

322
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Exactly.

323
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yeah.

324
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's fun.

325
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's fun.

326
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
We have a good team here in the UK.

327
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah.

328
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah.

329
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You haven't met any of this.

330
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Anybody.

331
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Wednesday.

332
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm going into town.

333
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I met the podcastings.

334
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You didn't eat some of those.

335
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You didn't eat some of them.

336
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
No, you didn't eat some of them.

337
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Some of them.

338
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You're using.

339
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So you didn't eat.

340
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But using.

341
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What the.

342
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I mean.

343
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Some of them.

344
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
We're working with us.

345
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes.

346
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Right.

347
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
God.

348
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And be careful.

349
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
They people already think I'm an evil ass.

350
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That sounds a bit rock and roll, probably.

351
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah.

352
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So I think you met Neil.

353
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I think pretty sure you met Neil Dixon.

354
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You probably don't remember.

355
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But if you saw him, you would remember.

356
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah.

357
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yeah.

358
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And so I'm meeting with Neil.

359
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Wednesday for lunch.

360
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You want to come?

361
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yeah.

362
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Neil.

363
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Waterloo.

364
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Wednesday.

365
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Wednesday.

366
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah.

367
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I have a meeting with some people.

368
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Wonderful.

369
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You want to come in?

370
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah.

371
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You can you can have lunch with us or you can.

372
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm a famous podcast.

373
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes.

374
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
How many times do I have to be here?

375
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You are.

376
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So famous and so well paid.

377
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Well paid.

378
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You're so.

379
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I haven't seen anything.

380
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You can see that big name.

381
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I've got the best.

382
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I've got you.

383
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I've got you.

384
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I've got you, babe.

385
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Okay.

386
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Maybe this will help.

387
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Maybe this will help me get going.

388
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah.

389
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I told you about Amy Max's answer size.

390
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah.

391
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Okay.

392
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So I kind of missed a show this week because of everything that was going on.

393
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So normally I do answer size on day that you're not here.

394
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah.

395
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Because you want your ass.

396
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah.

397
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Because you don't listen anyway.

398
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah.

399
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't have to embarrass myself.

400
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So why don't I do the exercise with you here today?

401
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Okay.

402
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And you know what this is all about.

403
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This of course is many, many weeks ago I said my ass is disintegrating.

404
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I need help.

405
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
My wife is complaining.

406
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Titing up the bomb.

407
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And Amy Mac of the fitness attack podcast, which by the way is like highlighted on iTunes

408
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and gets just an amazing audience.

409
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You should listen to this.

410
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
She's really good.

411
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
She also trains the whole pod show office.

412
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
She does.

413
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yeah.

414
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah.

415
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Twice a week.

416
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Tuesdays and Thursdays I think.

417
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
They have a workout.

418
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
All right.

419
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Otherwise we'd have a complete assless opening.

420
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You know, very exact.

421
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Because your guy is sitting and sitting and sitting.

422
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Hi.

423
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And another part of the bar.

424
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Hi.

425
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
We're from Pod Show.

426
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
We have no ass.

427
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah.

428
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You may have to help me out of here.

429
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Amy.

430
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You may have to help me out of here.

431
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Amy.

432
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I got you.

433
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Hi.

434
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
He's ready to save Adam's ass.

435
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah.

436
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm Amy Mac.

437
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Thank you.

438
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Adam's ass.

439
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Okay.

440
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Are you feeling good Adam?

441
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
No.

442
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm tired.

443
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You ready to go?

444
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yeah.

445
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
All right.

446
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Grab the wireless because we're on the photo today.

447
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You'll have to narrate on it.

448
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You're going to go down on all fours and go to the table position.

449
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
This is where your hands are under your shoulders and knees are under your hips.

450
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Great.

451
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Knees on your hips.

452
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Your right leg with your knee bent and 90 degrees.

453
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And the soul of your foot toward the ceiling.

454
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Oh yeah.

455
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Now you're going to raise your leg toward the ceiling as far as you can keeping your knee

456
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
at 90 degrees and without bending your back.

457
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
These are donkey kicks and we're going to do eight and then switch legs.

458
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Ready, go.

459
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Here you go.

460
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

461
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Great.

462
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Bring that leg down and take the other one up.

463
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Eight, seven, six, five.

464
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Four, three.

465
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah, you're doing a great.

466
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Still with me?

467
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yes.

468
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Good.

469
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Switch back to the right side.

470
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

471
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And now the left, last time.

472
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Ready, go.

473
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Have you eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, and one?

474
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yes.

475
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Come down.

476
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You're done.

477
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
This is in range by lower body exercise.

478
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
If you want to get fancy, you can set a dumbbell behind your knee and squeeze your cap.

479
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
A dumbbell?

480
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
A dumbbell?

481
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
A dumbbell, yeah.

482
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
This has a little more resistance and a little more intensity to this exercise.

483
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
To find my show, go to fitness.padshow.com.

484
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
As always, it's been a pleasure, Adam.

485
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Until next time.

486
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Thank you, Amy.

487
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I enjoyed that.

488
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
See you on hands with me.

489
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Well, thanks for not talking during the entire thing.

490
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's like, you're supposed to be describing what I'm doing.

491
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay.

492
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You're seeing it with your mouth open, though.

493
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's amazing.

494
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm like, would you please say something?

495
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm checking out your ass.

496
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's funny.

497
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Every single day.

498
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
How was it?

499
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It was good.

500
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It was good.

501
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It was good.

502
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's not that bad, huh?

503
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
What?

504
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Your ass is not that bad.

505
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Well, the Hacom yours complaining about.

506
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah.

507
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Well, if you feel it, you know, you squeeze the bun, the bun, the bun.

508
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah.

509
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You can feel that it's a bit empty.

510
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Yes.

511
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The shape is still there.

512
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But it's a bit floppy.

513
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You are so harsh.

514
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Uh-huh.

515
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
For some reason, every single time I do one of Amy's exercises, it hurts everywhere

516
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
except my actual ass.

517
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I mean, isn't the part that hurts?

518
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's the part that's going to build up muscle.

519
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah.

520
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
How can my ass doesn't hurt then?

521
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Well, how does it work?

522
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't understand it.

523
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't understand it.

524
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I don't understand it.

525
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Because I saw that your knees were not underneath your knees.

526
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What do you mean?

527
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I didn't perfect.

528
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
No, no.

529
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
No.

530
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Please go back.

531
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Talk.

532
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That's even easier.

533
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yeah.

534
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'll know what that's better.

535
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'll go a little bit more back.

536
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Back with your knees.

537
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That's it.

538
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That's it.

539
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Now it's good.

540
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Now you have to do it.

541
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I can do that.

542
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Say it one.

543
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
To know you can do it faster.

544
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah.

545
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But it's no big deal.

546
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah.

547
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
No big deal.

548
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yeah.

549
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
No big deal.

550
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Right?

551
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yeah.

552
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Come on.

553
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Don't keep kicking away.

554
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Well, I was taking a walk with you on the downs.

555
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And we were going up.

556
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And I was listening at you breathing.

557
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yeah.

558
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And it's not bad.

559
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's actually not bad.

560
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Well, no, of course not.

561
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
No.

562
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You're.

563
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm about to kill over.

564
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I said.

565
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Put a mattress.

566
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's not bad.

567
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's not bad.

568
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I have to say.

569
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You know.

570
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And I remember when we lived in America, you always did a lot of swimming.

571
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Because you were.

572
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah, we don't know.

573
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Such a sports guy.

574
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I know you can.

575
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And I did not swim a lot.

576
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's not true.

577
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
In the pool.

578
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It wasn't a lot.

579
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yeah, but you are good.

580
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You're good.

581
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And we did.

582
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And everywhere we went on vacation, we're hanging on things.

583
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And going behind boats.

584
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And you know.

585
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Because you're actually a sport of guy.

586
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah.

587
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But you know, I think a lot of that stopped after the motorcycle accident.

588
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I got like really unsporty for a long long long.

589
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
For a year.

590
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It took me a year to get my.

591
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
My gosh.

592
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Didn't.

593
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I know.

594
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It did not scare me.

595
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It made me very aware.

596
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah.

597
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But you go on everything.

598
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So if you say, John, we're going to jump.

599
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
We're going to hang on.

600
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm going to do it.

601
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You do it.

602
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You're right on any.

603
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I used to.

604
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I don't think I do that anymore.

605
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Now you think a little bit.

606
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I just remember it was a pain in the ass to not be able to sleep properly for a year.

607
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Not be able to take a crap pop properly for a year.

608
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah.

609
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Because that's literally.

610
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What's in it horrible?

611
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You're back.

612
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
There's something about your back and taking a crap.

613
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
That's very real.

614
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh.

615
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm not going to do it.

616
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
They say it's related to it.

617
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yes.

618
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm not going to show how it works.

619
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
People with back problems probably have also.

620
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
intestines who are not working very well.

621
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah.

622
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I have intestinal issues today too.

623
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Last night we had.

624
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So we're staying at the standards in hotel.

625
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Which is one of these already.

626
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I had a room with an egg in it, huh?

627
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It was a fucking egg.

628
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
An egg.

629
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
An egg.

630
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
This size.

631
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
How was it?

632
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Two feet long.

633
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Two foot long egg.

634
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's one of those hip.

635
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Ian Schrager hotel.

636
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Did you sit in it?

637
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
No.

638
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You could drink.

639
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You could trip over it.

640
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
But what did.

641
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What was the function?

642
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Just to look like an egg.

643
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Yeah.

644
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Exactly.

645
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
God.

646
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What an investment.

647
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So they had.

648
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah.

649
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Fantastic.

650
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So we had dinner and they had the.

651
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Was it wagyu?

652
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Wagyu beef?

653
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Mm-hmm.

654
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And I said, you know, what's wagyu?

655
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I think it was wagyu.

656
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Does it sound right wagyu?

657
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Let me look it up.

658
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And apparently wagyu is.

659
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The cows get massage.

660
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And good food.

661
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And, you know, people are talking to it.

662
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Oh, here we go.

663
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Wagyu.

664
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Crap.

665
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh, do we even have sound of that?

666
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
For several Japanese wagyu need also known as Kobe beef.

667
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Kobe style beef.

668
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah.

669
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But the waiter said it was from Australia.

670
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Australia.

671
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
From Australia.

672
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But yeah, what do they get?

673
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Well, maybe it's a Japanese idea.

674
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Mm-hmm.

675
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yeah, very typical.

676
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It looks good.

677
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Looks like a nice looking cow there.

678
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Is it a cow?

679
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I really don't know.

680
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Is it a cow?

681
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That's the question.

682
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Imperial cattle from Japan.

683
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Japanese.

684
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Well, whatever.

685
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What I said.

686
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What I said.

687
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yes.

688
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yes.

689
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Okay.

690
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
But I said this morning.

691
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
If your body is tired, then you shouldn't eat things that your body has to work for.

692
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I know.

693
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Because then you can just want it some more.

694
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I know what you mean.

695
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Because that's what my mom used to say.

696
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
All you need to take.

697
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Because you have been sick.

698
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yeah.

699
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yeah.

700
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yeah.

701
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's sick for a long time.

702
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yeah.

703
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's my state.

704
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I think your mom's right about that.

705
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Actually, I don't think to liver liver.

706
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I had to.

707
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I have to.

708
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I have to.

709
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I have to.

710
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I have to.

711
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Yeah.

712
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
That's not good for your cholesterol.

713
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah.

714
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Isn't that horrible?

715
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
That's the way we live these days.

716
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I do.

717
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I do.

718
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I do.

719
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I do.

720
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You know, and I was reading in the paper this morning that they were going to bend.

721
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
They're a very skinny skinny, very skinny models.

722
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Thank God for that.

723
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The worst example ever.

724
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Which ones give me which are the which models.

725
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Well, because they don't even have names.

726
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
These are the kids that get selected.

727
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And they have no.

728
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Yeah.

729
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Well, that's probably the way they're built.

730
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,160
But it's such a bad example, because I notice Christina talking about her body almost every day.

731
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,160
Yeah.

732
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,160
She thinks she's fat.

733
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:12,400
You know, not because she loves to eat, but you know, you can hear that it's troubles

734
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,720
her because she sees different pictures in the magazines of very skinny, skinny

735
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
models.

736
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
I'm most of those.

737
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,720
I think that's the way you should be.

738
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,800
Most of those magazine pictures, of course, are indeed of 13-year-olds and have been

739
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
photoshopped.

740
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
Well, photoshopped.

741
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
Lots of photoshopping.

742
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,000
You know, they select a lot of fun.

743
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,800
So what you're saying is that this really is affecting teenage girls, this story.

744
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Oh, yeah.

745
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,400
Why were they banned from the fashion show?

746
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
And who is the authority?

747
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
Who is the fashion police?

748
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:48,680
The magazine, people, they said it's over now, we're not going to do it anymore.

749
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,680
They're not going to put magazines.

750
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,680
They have complaints.

751
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,680
Yeah.

752
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,680
That will be a good start.

753
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,680
That will be a good start.

754
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,680
That's a good start.

755
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,240
They put fat bitches in there.

756
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,680
Because Christine looks beautiful.

757
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,680
She is gorgeous.

758
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,280
It's nothing wrong with her.

759
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,680
So what are they going to put in there now?

760
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,680
What is a little bit more normal?

761
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,720
For example, Kate Moss looks normal.

762
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,000
That's a normal girl.

763
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,720
She's not too tall.

764
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
She's not too skinny.

765
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
Yeah, that was right.

766
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
She is nice.

767
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
She's very normal.

768
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
Snort some cocaine with peaked dough.

769
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
That's not what I'm saying.

770
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
Very normal.

771
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
The picture.

772
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
A little bit of heroin.

773
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,720
Yeah.

774
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
Yeah.

775
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,720
What people do.

776
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,720
I mean, yeah.

777
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
Okay.

778
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
Well, I'm just telling you, that's another fine role model, which is perfect.

779
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
It's not a role model.

780
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,040
I mean, her body is a normal.

781
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:35,400
I'm just giving an example of somebody that looks a bit normal.

782
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Okay.

783
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
So the fashion.

784
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,040
But I'm just going to hold on to this story.

785
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Okay.

786
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,040
So, hold on.

787
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,400
I'm trying to understand because I think I just really want to know who is saying what?

788
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Is it the fashion?

789
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
And really, I'd like to know.

790
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
Yeah.

791
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
The fashion magazines.

792
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,200
So the fashion magazines are saying we're not going to show those pictures anymore.

793
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,200
This is about wrong.

794
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Let me finish.

795
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
God, you never let me finish.

796
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,200
I just want to get my fucking question out.

797
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Man, you haven't answered before, have you asked the fucking question?

798
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
Yeah.

799
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
The question is.

800
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Yeah.

801
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Because right now fashion shows are going on.

802
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,200
And I believe that the fashion either the, um, the kutriese.

803
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
Yeah.

804
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
So the people who are also.

805
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
You don't know.

806
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,200
Just say, I don't know.

807
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Who is they?

808
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Who's they?

809
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Who's they?

810
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Probably.

811
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
Where's the newspaper?

812
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Where's the newspaper?

813
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
downstairs.

814
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Which newspaper was it?

815
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
The son.

816
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
The independent.

817
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Oh, the independent.

818
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Yeah.

819
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
I'm sorry.

820
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
That picture.

821
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Not only with papers with pictures.

822
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Okay.

823
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
Excuse me.

824
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
All right.

825
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
So let's find out though.

826
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
If who exactly who it is.

827
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
If it's the fashion.

828
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,200
Fashion.

829
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Yes.

830
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
The authority who was calling the shot.

831
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Who used models in the magazines.

832
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Models in the fashion shows.

833
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,200
And if they start banning those very, very, very,

834
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
super skinny.

835
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Because that's where it has to start.

836
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Then it's much banning them from the catwalks.

837
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
From the catwalks.

838
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Or from the advertisements.

839
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
The advertisement.

840
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
From from start somewhere.

841
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
But do it.

842
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Okay.

843
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
Well, then this has to start with the magazines.

844
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,200
So I'll be very happy next week.

845
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
When I pick up a Vogue.

846
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Sorry.

847
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Next month when I pick up Vogue, which is the fashion Bible.

848
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Yeah.

849
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
Yes.

850
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,200
And I see no more skinny, skinny under nurse children in the magazine.

851
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
You're telling me that's going to happen.

852
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
Yes.

853
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
They're going to try that.

854
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
They're going to try to start somewhere.

855
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
The fashion.

856
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
The fashion authority.

857
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Police.

858
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
I will bet you.

859
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,200
I will bet you a million pounds.

860
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
It's not going to happen.

861
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
They're just, it's just lip service.

862
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
It's just not going to happen.

863
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
I don't believe that.

864
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,200
The strange thing is that if you look at the the designer stuff.

865
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
You know, you think, wow, it looks so cool.

866
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,200
And the jacket and then put something over it.

867
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
And you do.

868
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
And you put it over jeans.

869
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Now when you try it, it is a normal person.

870
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
You look like an idiot.

871
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
You know what I mean?

872
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Yes.

873
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
You have to wear dress over jeans.

874
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,200
And then maybe put socks over the.

875
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Over the over the jeans.

876
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
This is the fashion of the moment.

877
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Yeah.

878
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
This is the fashion.

879
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
You have to dress up your legs.

880
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,200
Dress up your legs.

881
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
No.

882
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
What are you talking about?

883
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,200
I saw Victoria Beckin with their legs.

884
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,200
Yeah, that's now because it's beautiful weather.

885
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
She has a shorts on now.

886
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
But the winter is dress up your legs.

887
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,200
What if you have a big bigger heavier legs?

888
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
That's not going to be a nice side.

889
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
All right.

890
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,200
I know you folks listening to serious stars 102 are riveted by this advice.

891
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,200
That's a lot more really good stuff coming up today on your Friday at 102.

892
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,200
No, I think going.

893
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,200
You know, so design is just coming up with things.

894
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,200
But they're thinking about very skinny, skinny, unusual looking people.

895
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
All right.

896
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Let's talk about something else now.

897
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,200
Okay.

898
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
So that's.

899
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
I'm happy with that.

900
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,200
It's a mother because I know that all her friends and also Christina.

901
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,200
Isn't my butt big?

902
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,200
I mean, I mean, yes, we don't have a little bit of a tummy.

903
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Yes, you should.

904
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,200
Last night, we talked about death.

905
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,200
Yeah.

906
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,200
That was, that was the, I think really the first time.

907
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,200
You would not tune me.

908
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
I feel like shit.

909
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
Yeah.

910
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,200
That was maybe the.

911
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,200
Oh, there's the, there's the post guys.

912
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
But did you call them?

913
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
Or did they bring that guy?

914
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,200
Yeah.

915
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,200
Of course.

916
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Oh, man.

917
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
Is he going to interrupt the show?

918
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Well, sure.

919
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
I should get it.

920
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
And you can just go on.

921
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,200
Well, I don't know.

922
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Let's see if he rings our door.

923
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
Sure.

924
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Looks like it.

925
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Just as I was about to talk about death, he shows up on your doorstep.

926
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
The business post guy.

927
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
Postman rings the post.

928
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,200
Why?

929
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,200
Let me just see.

930
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
Is he coming?

931
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
Yeah.

932
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
Hold on a second.

933
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
Let me get a song.

934
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,200
Should we play a song?

935
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
And then we can go figure that out.

936
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
We talk about death.

937
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
I want to talk about death.

938
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
I think we should talk about death.

939
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
Yeah.

940
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
I'll play a really happy death song.

941
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Okay.

942
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
Hold on a second.

943
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
I played this yesterday.

944
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,200
And I really, really liked it.

945
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
Yeah.

946
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
I really liked it.

947
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
And actually, as I played it yesterday, I thought,

948
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,200
I should play that on Friday for Patricia.

949
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,200
I love you every single day.

950
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,200
I love you from the moment that away.

951
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,200
I love you more than you'll ever know.

952
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,200
I love you wherever you go.

953
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,200
I love you here and you smile.

954
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,200
You're teeth in your eyes.

955
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,200
You're so much more beautiful than me.

956
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
We should be together.

957
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,200
We would be so happy.

958
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,200
I picked you up and down the streets.

959
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
You are walking next to me.

960
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
Hand in hand.

961
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,200
We walk along.

962
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
We'll be so happy.

963
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,200
People will say it's wrong.

964
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,200
I love you every single day.

965
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,200
I love you from the moment that away.

966
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
I love you every single day.

967
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,200
I love you from the moment that away.

968
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
I love you more than you'll ever know.

969
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,200
I love you wherever you go.

970
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,200
You took an order against me.

971
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
The magistrate said that I was naughty.

972
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,200
Within a thousand feet of you, I cannot go.

973
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,200
I watch you from the edge of the exclusion zone.

974
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,200
Yesterday you were wearing pink.

975
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
You went into the park for a drink.

976
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,200
It had scotch and coat with the man named Brett.

977
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Brett is dead.

978
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,200
Brett was a threat to me.

979
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,200
I love you every single day.

980
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,200
I love you from the moment that away.

981
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
I love you more than you'll ever know.

982
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,200
I love you wherever you go.

983
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,200
There isn't anything that I would rather do.

984
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,200
Then spend the rest of my life with you.

985
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,200
But they want to send me to jail.

986
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Because I sent you my love in the mail.

987
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:22,200
I want to keep you in a box of beautiful box with velvet lining and a hole in the lens.

988
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,200
So I can slip your food.

989
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,200
We'll be together.

990
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,200
It will be so good.

991
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,200
I love you every single day.

992
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
I love you every single way.

993
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
We'll be together just you and me.

994
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:42,200
And the woods in the cabin in a box for eternity.

995
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
I love you every single day.

996
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,200
I love you from the moment that away.

997
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
I love you more than you'll ever know.

998
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,200
I love you wherever you go.

999
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
I love you every single day.

1000
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,200
I love you from the moment that away.

1001
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,200
I love you more than you'll ever know.

1002
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
I love you wherever you go.

1003
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,200
There from Australia.

1004
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
No, what's that?

1005
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,200
Told you.

1006
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,200
It's a great song.

1007
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,200
The Gorses.

1008
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
A single day.

1009
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
You know, nice.

1010
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
They're wacky.

1011
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
It's kind of like a stalker song.

1012
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
Yes, it is.

1013
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,200
But it's creepy.

1014
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,200
But someone could love you like that.

1015
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,200
I put you in the basement.

1016
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,200
You know, like that.

1017
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
And we'll never let you out.

1018
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
In a wooden box with velvet.

1019
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,200
Mmm.

1020
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,200
So last night Patricia says,

1021
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
Oh, God.

1022
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
I'm afraid of dying.

1023
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,200
That's pretty much what you said.

1024
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,200
Yeah.

1025
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200
And we really hadn't talked about this since my mom died.

1026
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,200
No.

1027
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,200
And,

1028
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Well, we talked for a while.

1029
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,200
How do you feel this morning?

1030
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
Much better.

1031
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,200
I didn't have the chance to express my feeling.

1032
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Actually, because it was your mom.

1033
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Mm-hmm.

1034
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,200
And you are not really talking about it.

1035
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,200
Although you had, you suffered enough.

1036
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
All those weeks, of course.

1037
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
And I thought,

1038
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,200
Whew.

1039
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
Well, it was a progression of two years.

1040
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,200
I saw it.

1041
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
Hale a little bit.

1042
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
Yeah.

1043
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Well, here, I think here's the basic conversation that we had.

1044
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,200
So for both of us, this was the first person who close to us who died.

1045
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,200
Yeah, that's close.

1046
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
Yeah, definitely.

1047
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,200
And I was there.

1048
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,200
You know, that even if you've ever seen someone breathe their last breath.

1049
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
Yeah.

1050
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,200
It's quite an experience.

1051
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,200
We didn't have a lot of friends or people close to us dying,

1052
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
which is wonderful, actually.

1053
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Yeah.

1054
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,200
A lot of people we know very seriously through show business.

1055
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
Yeah.

1056
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
But it's still not quite the same.

1057
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
No, not quite the same.

1058
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,200
Not quite the same.

1059
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,200
So a couple of years ago, a friend of ours died.

1060
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
Which one?

1061
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
Yeah.

1062
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,200
Oh, Baya.

1063
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
Baya.

1064
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
Before that, ale.

1065
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
But ale.

1066
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,200
He drank himself.

1067
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
He drank himself to death.

1068
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,200
So, you know, we, and he was a crazy person that really enjoyed his life.

1069
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,200
And we all knew that somehow he wasn't going to last breath.

1070
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
He was going to end like that.

1071
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
I was not unexpected.

1072
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:14,200
So, but when our mutual, mutual friend, Baya died of cancer so fast, you wouldn't even, you know,

1073
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
believe it.

1074
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
That was very traumatic.

1075
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,200
You know, I walked around for hours in Amsterdam and cried my eyes out.

1076
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,200
I couldn't just, I didn't know what to do with the feelings.

1077
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
I've never felt it like this.

1078
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:34,200
And now that you're mom, and I've seen her, actually, two or three weeks before she died.

1079
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
That's, get the hell out of me.

1080
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,200
And I was, I was in shock when I saw her.

1081
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,200
Yeah, I know.

1082
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:49,200
And, you know, coming from showbees, and you know how to suppress your feelings and not show it.

1083
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
So, we all did.

1084
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:56,200
We had a nice and lovely afternoon, but it was, had an enormous impact on me.

1085
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,200
Didn't talk about it, actually.

1086
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:07,200
And your mom and I, and I were actually not, like, mother-in-law and mother, you know,

1087
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,200
and, you know, and daughter-in-law, we actually became friends and we talked, you know,

1088
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,200
for a long time on the phone about all sorts of things.

1089
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,200
Because your mom was very intelligent and wonderful to talk to.

1090
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
And, and I miss that.

1091
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,200
And, um, now I start to think about it every day.

1092
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,200
I think, oh, she's not there.

1093
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,200
And, oh, it was so scary.

1094
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,200
And we were so fast.

1095
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
And you start to think about death.

1096
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,200
And then I go with, with my dog to the doctor.

1097
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,200
The last one that we have left, little, little swabber, is a Yorkie.

1098
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
He's always been fine.

1099
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,200
He's, he's, uh, healthy dog, never been sick in his life.

1100
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,200
And what said the, the vet says he's going to die.

1101
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
He has, uh, a, a kidney failure.

1102
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,200
You know, okay.

1103
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
That's death again.

1104
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:58,200
And so, you know, you, there are some weeks and days that you just, you know.

1105
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
So here's what I concluded last night after.

1106
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
And now the less couple of nights,

1107
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,200
I wake up in the middle of the night and get scared, scared of everything.

1108
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,200
And everything is dying.

1109
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
And I don't want to die.

1110
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,200
And, and I have the heart disease.

1111
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,200
And, you know, and all those stupid, you know, like, stupid things.

1112
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,200
And you wake up and you think, oh, you know, it's not that bad, actually.

1113
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
And then it's gone.

1114
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
But it ruins your night.

1115
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
No.

1116
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
And you are scared.

1117
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,200
It's dark.

1118
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,200
You all, you feel lonely or snoring.

1119
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Everything's snoring.

1120
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,200
Everyone's asleep.

1121
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
You don't want to wake anybody.

1122
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,200
But you feel horrible.

1123
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
You want to have a warm, you want to just feel somebody.

1124
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,200
And, you know, and so very typical Patricia of course has had this for three

1125
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,200
three nights or maybe even longer and doesn't wake me up.

1126
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,200
So last night, finally, the story came out.

1127
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,200
And here's, because, you know, we were, it was a good conversation.

1128
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,200
I think, um, short, but I'm not sure.

1129
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
I'm not sure.

1130
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
How long?

1131
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
You kept saying, shut up and go to sleep.

1132
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,200
Eventually, I'll just say, okay.

1133
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
Yeah.

1134
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,200
Okay.

1135
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,200
Um, we are not, um, we are not religious people.

1136
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Yeah.

1137
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
We are definitely spiritual people.

1138
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
Very spiritual.

1139
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,200
We have faith in things.

1140
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,200
But, you know, there are hundreds of millions of people.

1141
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,200
If not billions of people around the world who have a belief.

1142
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,200
And as we talked about it last night, it kind of dawned on me that a lot of religion,

1143
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,200
a lot of belief, is about dying.

1144
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,200
And it's a way to overcome these exact fears.

1145
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,200
You know, people who are strong believers, whether they're Christians, or Muslims, or Jews,

1146
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,200
or Buddhists, or what else is there?

1147
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,200
Harry Krishna.

1148
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,200
Whatever it is.

1149
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,200
It's, it's usually about the afterlife.

1150
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,200
And people who believe that strongly.

1151
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
That strength have no fear.

1152
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,200
Do not have fear.

1153
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
And for me, my mom dying.

1154
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
And of course, it's emotional for me.

1155
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,200
And I've been able to, well, you know,

1156
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:59,200
I've been so busy that it's been much easier for me to suppress emotional feelings.

1157
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,200
But I wasn't San Francisco for three weeks.

1158
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,200
And I had a good, you know, good time by myself to process and things.

1159
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,200
So the emotions, but process.

1160
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,200
But my mom dying made me no longer afraid of death.

1161
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,200
I'm not quite sure if I wanted to be fast or slow.

1162
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,200
I really don't.

1163
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,200
Really?

1164
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Well, you know, my mom did have a chance to say goodbye to everybody.

1165
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,200
And make a men's and talk to a lot of people and do.

1166
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
And really have some conversations that she,

1167
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,200
excuse me, that she needed to have, that she wanted to have.

1168
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,200
When I called Uncle Donna, I'm like the first thing Uncle Don said is,

1169
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,200
you know, in the Bible, he said, it states that you're blessed

1170
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,200
if you don't die suddenly, so you can say goodbye to people.

1171
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,200
So that could be true.

1172
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,200
There's something to the piece of it that we said for that.

1173
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,200
So I'm not sure about it, but I'm not afraid.

1174
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,200
Because you, it makes no sense to be it.

1175
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,200
I feel better when you said goodbye.

1176
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,200
What do you mean?

1177
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:04,200
Well, do you think you, the feeling about somebody dying and you have the time to say goodbye?

1178
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,200
Do you think it's better for the whole process?

1179
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,200
I think that I witnessed the entire process was easier.

1180
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,200
It was more of a gradual slide.

1181
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
I think that was a lot easier than all of a sudden.

1182
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,200
Being jerked from your life, I think that's somebody gets killed outside.

1183
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
You know, run, run over by.

1184
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
But that's, but I didn't die.

1185
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,200
So I don't know, which, you know, that may be better for me, but was it better for my mom?

1186
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
I don't know.

1187
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,200
I really don't know.

1188
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,200
Yeah.

1189
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,200
But I'm not afraid of it.

1190
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,200
You can't be, I just don't think you can be afraid of something you can't stop anyway.

1191
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,200
There's one thing I know for sure.

1192
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,200
We're all going to die.

1193
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,200
Yeah.

1194
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,200
You know what?

1195
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,200
I'm thinking all the time because when I was there that afternoon,

1196
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,200
there was the last time I saw her.

1197
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Yeah.

1198
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:55,200
She said to me, she was sitting there in a chair with a little head on her, on her head.

1199
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,200
And she said, my God, you look so good.

1200
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,200
And you know, sometimes you don't know what to say when people say that because she looked so horrible.

1201
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,200
So horrible.

1202
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,200
So horrible.

1203
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,200
You know, it couldn't get worse.

1204
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,200
And I didn't know what to say.

1205
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,200
And I said, oh, yeah.

1206
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,200
Well, I really, well, I got up so early.

1207
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
And I thought, what the hell was that all about?

1208
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
Why did I say that?

1209
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,200
I'm still thinking, why did I say that?

1210
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,200
But I didn't know what to say.

1211
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,200
Yeah.

1212
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
Because usually I would say, well, you look very good yourself.

1213
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
You know, nice dress or decent of that.

1214
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Maybe it was beautiful.

1215
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,200
But you're kind of avoiding the topic.

1216
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,200
The topic surrounds the idea of being afraid of death.

1217
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,200
And you and your mom too, by the way.

1218
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,200
Definitely afraid of death this morning.

1219
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,200
And we said to each other, let's not do that anymore.

1220
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
Your mom is freaking hers.

1221
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
I mean, she's 81.

1222
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,200
So I understand.

1223
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,200
Well, don't forget that.

1224
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,200
And your dad's 81.

1225
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,200
And he's had a quadruple bypass for 20 years.

1226
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,200
I understand all that.

1227
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Yeah.

1228
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
And they're burying their friends.

1229
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,200
Yeah.

1230
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:01,200
But so, so, but I guess, I guess we're at the point now where, you know, you can make a choice.

1231
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,200
There's a couple choices.

1232
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,200
One, we can be afraid of death.

1233
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,200
Two, we cannot be afraid of death.

1234
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Or see, we can become very religious.

1235
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,200
That's also an option.

1236
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,200
You know, I've never been afraid of death.

1237
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,200
I've never thought about it.

1238
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,200
I've never thought about it.

1239
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,200
I was too much.

1240
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,200
I was so busy enjoying life.

1241
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,200
You know, enjoying every day, waking, you know, how I am.

1242
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,200
Every day I wake up, I think Jesus, you know, I'm happy to be alive.

1243
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
Oh, I said, Jesus.

1244
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,200
But I did mean that.

1245
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,200
Oh, God.

1246
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,200
You are really so happy I'm alive.

1247
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,200
And another beautiful day to gift.

1248
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,200
Yeah.

1249
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,200
You know, I think like that.

1250
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,200
Right.

1251
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,200
So then, why spend one second of that beauty?

1252
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,200
Let me finish the question.

1253
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,200
Oh, I thought it was a question.

1254
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,200
It was a question.

1255
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,200
Let me finish the question.

1256
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,200
Okay.

1257
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,200
Even though you and I don't need more than two words,

1258
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,200
we do have listeners who want it.

1259
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,200
That's true.

1260
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,200
Okay.

1261
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,200
So if you're so happy, if you're so happy,

1262
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
when you wake up and it's a gift,

1263
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,200
why spend one second of that day worrying about death?

1264
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,200
Why don't do it?

1265
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,200
Yeah.

1266
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,200
You've got to agree with me.

1267
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,200
That's just worthless.

1268
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
It doesn't, it doesn't contribute anything.

1269
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,200
There's nothing you can do.

1270
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,200
But the fear of death.

1271
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,200
I think is death.

1272
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,200
Yeah.

1273
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,200
Really?

1274
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,200
Really?

1275
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,200
And you and your mom, with all respect,

1276
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,200
yeah, it's just something I've noticed in 20 years.

1277
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,200
And you know, it's like,

1278
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
Oh, God, I was gonna happen.

1279
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,200
Oh, does something happen?

1280
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
Oh, did you fall down?

1281
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,200
You died.

1282
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
Oh, we're gonna die.

1283
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,200
Oh, don't do this.

1284
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
Oh, very happy.

1285
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
Happy people.

1286
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
Yeah, yes, you're happy,

1287
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,200
but there is an inner, un-ease that you have.

1288
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,200
That I'd really, I'd like to help you get rid of that.

1289
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,200
There's a urge to take care of other people.

1290
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,200
But that's one thing.

1291
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,200
That's one thing.

1292
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,200
That's one thing.

1293
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,200
But everything.

1294
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,200
But it's very focused around death.

1295
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,200
No.

1296
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,200
I don't think so.

1297
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,200
As the ultimate.

1298
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
It has this moment.

1299
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,200
And this was my moment.

1300
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,200
This is your moment.

1301
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,200
And it was this week that I thought about it.

1302
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,200
Maybe some things triggered.

1303
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,200
I don't know.

1304
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
Also, as my mom showed up in your,

1305
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,200
maybe that's it.

1306
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,200
Maybe that's it.

1307
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,200
Maybe that's it.

1308
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,200
Maybe that woke me up.

1309
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,200
I don't know.

1310
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Hmm.

1311
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,200
I don't know.

1312
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,200
Because someone hasn't completely passed on until she's visited Patricia in her life.

1313
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,200
Yes, absolutely.

1314
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,200
Absolutely.

1315
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
And you're telling me, I don't believe.

1316
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,200
Well, that was not what I said last night.

1317
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,200
I said, you know, I have my own story.

1318
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
I have a belief as to what happens when you die.

1319
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,200
Yeah.

1320
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,200
And maybe I can't even really verbalize it.

1321
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,200
But I do have some kind of ideas about it.

1322
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Which give me something to believe in.

1323
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,200
Yeah.

1324
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,200
You have different experiences.

1325
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,200
You believe much more in the spirits and the spiritual world.

1326
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,200
So you've got to build your story and then believe in it and stick to it.

1327
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,200
What difference is it making?

1328
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,200
Mine as well.

1329
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,200
You know, be happy because you believe something's going to happen a certain way.

1330
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,200
And maybe if you believe something's going to happen a certain way.

1331
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,200
It actually will happen that way.

1332
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,200
Yeah.

1333
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,200
Sometimes you feel guilty because you've got such a great life.

1334
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,200
Everything goes so well.

1335
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,200
That's not good.

1336
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,200
I was reading in the newspaper George Clooney.

1337
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,200
Yeah.

1338
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,200
Told the United Nations that they have to help out in Darfur.

1339
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,200
I saw that.

1340
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:21,200
Because if the UN pulls out there was it 7,000 relief workers, then two and a half million people will die.

1341
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,200
Yeah.

1342
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:29,200
And that was a story about an inch wide below the fold on the inside towards the

1343
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
crease of page three.

1344
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,200
Yeah.

1345
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,200
But it was on the news also on BBC news.

1346
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,200
Yeah.

1347
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,200
But as an entertainment story.

1348
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,200
Or do they really?

1349
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,200
No.

1350
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,200
No.

1351
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,200
No.

1352
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,200
I've seen it a couple of times because he called it as horrible as the Holocaust cost.

1353
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,200
Oh.

1354
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,200
You remember for Darfur that guy.

1355
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,200
He did like, I don't know.

1356
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,200
It was like 1500 pounds or something like that for a helicopter flight that I put

1357
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,200
up.

1358
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,200
Yeah.

1359
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,200
Yeah.

1360
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,200
So it was an auction.

1361
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,200
You came from a Holocaust to do that.

1362
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,200
Oh, because it was for the Holocaust.

1363
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,200
Yeah.

1364
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,200
That's what I said.

1365
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,200
From Darfur.

1366
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,200
It was a country.

1367
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,200
He gave money to Darfur.

1368
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,200
Oh, that's why.

1369
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,200
It's about Darfur.

1370
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,200
Why are you mentioning in a helicopter?

1371
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,200
Anything to talk about helicopters.

1372
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,200
Oh, no.

1373
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,200
No.

1374
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,200
Now, just hit me.

1375
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,200
I just remembered because it's been like a year and a half since I've been trying to

1376
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,200
hook this up with this Pascal who was going to surprise his dad.

1377
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,200
He did all this money because I had helicopter hours and said go ahead and you know.

1378
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,200
That's what I did it.

1379
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
Yeah.

1380
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,200
Yeah.

1381
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,200
Yeah.

1382
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,200
But no, but no.

1383
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,200
But no, no, no.

1384
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,200
No, no, no.

1385
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,200
I saw him and on TV is on George Clooney.

1386
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,200
George.

1387
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:47,200
And I thought it was good that he did that.

1388
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,200
Yeah.

1389
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,200
Somebody has to tell me.

1390
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,200
I hope.

1391
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,200
I mean, what do we need to do?

1392
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,200
This is what this is the point that I.

1393
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,200
It always breaks down from me.

1394
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,200
What can I do?

1395
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,200
What can I do at this point?

1396
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,200
I mean, I've helped raise money for Duffer.

1397
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,200
But what can I really do?

1398
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,200
Well, they have to give these people attention and why is the you end pulling out?

1399
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,200
Why is the you end pulling out of Duffer?

1400
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,200
Exactly.

1401
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,200
See, we got it.

1402
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
Why do you think I know that?

1403
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,200
No, no, no, no.

1404
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,200
You watched the BBC report.

1405
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,200
Didn't you?

1406
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,200
Or you just looking at George Clooney's ass.

1407
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,200
That too.

1408
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,200
Exactly.

1409
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,200
This is the problem with with celebrity endorsements ladies and gentlemen.

1410
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,200
You get people looking at their ass.

1411
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,200
Maybe I should just stop ascertaining.

1412
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,200
And then in the meanwhile, you think, hey, you know,

1413
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,200
who's doing a thing about?

1414
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,200
Apparently September 30th is some kind of deadline.

1415
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,200
So we'd have to do something pretty quickly.

1416
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,200
Exactly.

1417
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,200
But it's clearly messed up.

1418
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,200
Horrible.

1419
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,200
Okay.

1420
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,200
That was a pretty much big fucking bummer.

1421
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,200
Yeah.

1422
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,200
Bummer conversation.

1423
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,200
But it feels good.

1424
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,200
You have to get rid of your feelings now.

1425
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:53,200
Because I sometimes tend to keep him and not,

1426
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,200
and not, you know, express yourself.

1427
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,200
Yeah, for not worrying other people with it.

1428
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,200
Yeah, but it doesn't work.

1429
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,200
It doesn't work.

1430
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,200
Boring other people with it.

1431
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,200
So are you still afraid?

1432
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,200
Of course I'm afraid.

1433
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,200
And I am afraid.

1434
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,200
Yeah.

1435
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,200
And that's also since, you know,

1436
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,200
I was diagnosed with an heart disease.

1437
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,200
Before that,

1438
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,200
I never thought about it.

1439
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,200
Never.

1440
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,200
I thought I lived forever.

1441
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,200
You know, now it's just, you know,

1442
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,200
hanging above my head and just keeps hanging.

1443
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,200
You got to get rid of that thing.

1444
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,200
And sometimes I don't think about it, you know,

1445
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,200
and most of the time I don't think about it,

1446
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,200
say that.

1447
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,200
Uh-huh.

1448
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,200
But, you know, there are moments.

1449
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,200
And because, and the thing is with heart disease,

1450
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,200
if you worry and you stress,

1451
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,200
your heart hurts.

1452
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,200
So it's sort of a cycle.

1453
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,200
It's a vicious circle.

1454
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,200
Yes, it is.

1455
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,200
So let's work on that.

1456
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,200
Yep.

1457
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,200
Let's think happy.

1458
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,200
I'm sure lots of people have ideas and suggestions

1459
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,200
and feedback on this.

1460
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,200
There's no doubt people will be calling.

1461
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,200
A column will give you the voicemail number.

1462
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,200
Plus one.

1463
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,200
The plus is necessary.

1464
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,200
If you're entering this into your mobile phone.

1465
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,200
Uh-huh.

1466
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,200
So plus one, 201, 65, 65, 65,

1467
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,200
seven, or in London,

1468
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,200
207, 681, 3753.

1469
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,200
That will be plus four, four,

1470
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,200
207, 681, 3753.

1471
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,200
Uh, we'd love hearing it.

1472
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,200
Okay.

1473
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,200
Yeah.

1474
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,200
I'm saying, you know,

1475
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,200
and then podcast, podcast.

1476
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,200
Yeah.

1477
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,200
podcast.

1478
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,200
Well, podcast.

1479
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,200
It's actually very good to express your feelings.

1480
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,200
Yeah.

1481
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,200
And it doesn't cost anything, actually.

1482
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,200
To do this, you know,

1483
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,200
just grab your mic and get rid of it.

1484
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,200
Very good.

1485
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,200
Are you going to do your own show now?

1486
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,200
No.

1487
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,200
Is that a note?

1488
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,200
That's a note.

1489
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,200
You'd be great.

1490
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,200
You'd be great at your show.

1491
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,200
There's a new Frank Truth.

1492
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,200
I would be in my own language, I think.

1493
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,200
Oh, really?

1494
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,200
You do a podcast in Dutch for that huge Dutch audience.

1495
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,200
If I, if I, if I,

1496
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,200
Why you are so good in English?

1497
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,200
No.

1498
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,200
You listen.

1499
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,200
Still translating my head now and then.

1500
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,200
Oh, man, your head must be overloaded.

1501
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,200
Wearing about death, translating languages.

1502
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,200
If it gets complicated, I have to,

1503
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,200
because I hear it in Dutch, and I don't have to quickly translate it.

1504
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,200
The more you do it, the more you speak to language,

1505
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,200
is no exactly what I mean.

1506
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,200
I know, I speak to languages,

1507
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,200
but the more you do it, the more naturally it will come to you.

1508
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,200
Yeah, I know.

1509
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,200
Or the more it will come to you naturally.

1510
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,200
See, no, I was having problems with the Dutch in English.

1511
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,200
Okay.

1512
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,200
Anyway, flying to Amsterdam Sunday.

1513
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,200
Yep.

1514
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,200
Getting all of our visas and all that crap done Monday.

1515
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,200
I hope that you're, um, identity, uh...

1516
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,200
No.

1517
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,200
Come in the mail today.

1518
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,200
No, did you see it in the mail this morning?

1519
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,200
I didn't see the mail.

1520
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,200
No.

1521
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,200
Oh, okay, maybe it's there.

1522
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,200
Okay.

1523
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,200
It's so much paperwork.

1524
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,200
No, no, no, that was, that's a FedEx.

1525
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,200
So much paperwork.

1526
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,200
So much that has to be done.

1527
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,200
I know.

1528
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,200
But.

1529
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,200
My goodness.

1530
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,200
Okay.

1531
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,200
Do we leave it at that?

1532
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,200
Yeah.

1533
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,200
Think about it over the weekend.

1534
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,200
Oh, you know, you can, you're not always, uh, fun and laughing.

1535
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,200
Oh, no.

1536
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,200
Yeah, this is, I think this is fun.

1537
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,200
Discuss our thoughts.

1538
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,200
Let's talk about it some more in a couple of weeks.

1539
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,200
Mm-hmm.

1540
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,200
Okay.

1541
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,200
I think we'll go lie down now.

1542
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,200
Yeah.

1543
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,200
I can see that.

1544
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,200
I think I'm going to crow into the fetal position.

1545
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,200
Yeah.

1546
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,200
Fall over.

1547
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,200
All right, baby.

1548
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,200
