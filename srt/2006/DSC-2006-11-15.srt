oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh I Ele mesa

21
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:15,240
not a lot of sleep last night, I have to say Patricia getting a really early, like 430 this morning to jump on a commercial airplane to go to a Rotterdam.

22
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,240
More rehearsals for strictly come dancing as you would say in the UK or dancing with the stars.

23
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:33,240
So she'll be back tomorrow. So I'm Mr. Mom and of course we didn't get a lot of sleep at all considering Christina has come down with a very, very severe case of the flu.

24
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,240
She's really, really congested and just not feeling well.

25
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,240
So I'm kind of running around doing, you know, there you go.

26
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,240
Mom's got a lot of work to do, damn it.

27
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,240
Then of course I have two cats in the dog to look after as well.

28
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:54,240
But anyway, so I was previewing songs for the show and Christina kind of like tumbled in and she said,

29
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
Oh, what was that song?

30
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,240
You're just playing.

31
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,240
And I said, it's a bucklist. She said, oh, that's really good.

32
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,240
So that's why it opened the show, obviously.

33
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,240
So I didn't have a lot of preparations.

34
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,240
A lot going on in the London office this week, which today I'm not going to be able to attend everything.

35
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,240
I hope Christina is doing better tomorrow.

36
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,240
So I can slip off to London.

37
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,240
But as she is today, not really tonight.

38
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Late somewhere between 11 and midnight, I'll be checking in with San Francisco.

39
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,240
We've got management meeting.

40
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
This is the second one that's been here. So I've been here a month.

41
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,240
Time to go back. And yes, indeed, Sunday.

42
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,240
Sunday going off to San Francisco for at least a week to, well, to be with everybody.

43
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,240
Man, I think, there are now at least 10 people who I've not,

44
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,240
not yet met who actually are working at Pod Show HQ in San Francisco.

45
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,240
And just a lot, just a lot happening.

46
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
A lot of correspondence.

47
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:55,240
I always know that it's really busy when my curry.com email basically shuts down because of the amount of spam mixed in with the huge

48
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,240
enclosures that people send me.

49
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,240
And so just reminder, it's Adam at PodShow.com.

50
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,240
We're PodShow.

51
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,240
Do it.

52
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,240
Others want to copy us.

53
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
These catches like old hamburgers.

54
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
They need to catch up.

55
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,240
The whack shows, whack flows with no spine.

56
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,240
They need to catch up.

57
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,240
The whack shows, whack flows with no spine.

58
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,240
They need to catch up.

59
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,240
The whack shows, whack flows with no spine.

60
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,240
They need to catch up.

61
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,240
The whack shows, whack flows with no spine.

62
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
They need to catch up.

63
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,240
The whack shows, whack flows with no spine.

64
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
They need to catch up.

65
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
They need to catch up.

66
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
The whack shows, whack flows with no spine.

67
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,240
They need to catch up.

68
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:08,240
This is the main part of the mix.

69
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,240
The whack shows, whack flows with no spine.

70
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,240
Yeah.

71
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,240

78
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:39,160
I'm gonna be relying heavily on the music today, and some interesting comments coming in.

79
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,440
Adam, how are you doing?

80
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,120
It's Paul Nichols here, South of Spirming, Central England, but the Sun that you can

81
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:52,840
hear is Swasaland, I actually recorded this fantastic, absolutely amazing, just want to

82
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:58,280
talk about a couple of things, really sits in journalism, you can hear the show podcast

83
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,360
Paul.com, and it's not just about the plight of orphans and the plight of the country

84
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,640
of Swasaland, but just how great things are, and the some fantastic science and stuff.

85
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:15,560
Anyway, more current is the fact that I'd like to thank pod show for taking a sponsorship

86
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,080
role at Podcast Conference, as you know, it's this Saturday, I look forward to seeing

87
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,960
you, and there are many other folks as well, CC Chapman, Mark from Tart and Podcast, loads

88
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:31,040
of guys coming along, and it's really, it's just, you know, it's really good to have

89
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,800
your support, and I'm very grateful for that, and just like to thank you, and pod show

90
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,820
publicly, it's a non-profit organisation for us, effectively put our money where our

91
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,640
mouths are, and it's going to be a great day, really it's going to be a good day.

92
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,560
But also Roger Blessing, I'd love to see Roger, and I think Roger's got the wrong

93
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,560
end of the stick, you know, we'd all absolutely love to see him, gosh we would certainly

94
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,480
wouldn't be taking the mic out of him, we'd like all that to buy in the bear, and let me

95
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,040
just say Roger if you're listening, there's a free ticket for you mate, and Adam, you might

96
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,360
seem to be able to give Roger a lift, mate, look forward to seeing you all Saturday, all

97
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
the best.

98
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
See ya, bye my name.

99
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:20,600
All right, Roger Smalls, the Elvis now of independent audio and video production, go to

100
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,720
a conference, Roger, there's always a ticket waiting for you, that's what a lot of bands

101
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,640
do, they always have Elvis Presley at the Will Call desk, just in case he shows up and wants

102
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,120
to see their show, so I guess that's what we're doing now with Roger Smalls, Roger Smalls

103
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,520
always will call the Elvis of podcasting.

104
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,280
Yeah, no, very happy to sponsor the event, and this is something that could fully stand

105
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:49,520
behind, because it really is, the money is really going directly towards the enjoyment

106
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:56,440
for all independent producers who are going to be there, and you know, it is done by volunteers

107
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,600
and it just really felt right, it really did.

108
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,760
I'm not sure what time I will be arriving, I'm not sure how long I can stay, I really

109
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,160
hope I'm there to see the shakes perform, it'll kind of depend on the situation here

110
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,320
at home, and of course Sunday morning, I'm leaving early to go to San Francisco, so a lot

111
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,040
of stuff, I'm definitely coming, I'm definitely coming Saturday, I just don't know what

112
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,000
time or how long, and and welcome by the way, all the new listeners who have checked us

119
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,840
listened to this morning's DSC, got out of the shower and turned going, and I can't believe

120
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:33,640
you're inviting me up to San Francisco for Thanksgiving, I will do my best to try to get

121
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,880
out of doing the family thing and fly up there, I really want to see you, and I think

122
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,440
it would be so cool for us to be alone on Thanksgiving.

123
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,600
Anyways, thank you so much for the invitation, and I'm going to do my best to take you up

124
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,720
on it, got to go, have a good day, bye.

125
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:58,240
I'm and I'm going to be in so much trouble, Giselle, send me a picture, just so I know what

126
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,920
you look like, so you know what I look like, so I have kind of an unfair advantage.

127
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,520
Would you mind terribly dear?

128
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520

'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, I know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying and you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying you know what I'm saying, you know, what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying you know

149
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,360
She'll be back again, yeah

150
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,360
This goes, this goes

151
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,360
She goes, yeah

152
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
She goes, yeah

153
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,360
She goes, yeah

154
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,360
She goes, yeah

155
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
She's gonna stay

156
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,360
She's gonna stay

157
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
She died until the story

158
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,360
Oh, she died until the story is still

159
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,360
She was basically cuted by, and everybody's lovely in hair

160
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360
I'm sorry

161
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
Love

162
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,360
I wanna be numerous, but hopefully I wanna be a rebel

163
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,860
Tonight, today, I end

164
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,660
We'll go outside

165
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,360
And all of a sudden, you didn't, yeah

166
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,360
No, I'll be thirsty

167
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,360
But I can't run

168
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,360
Someone's today,選 badge

169
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,120
I want to read you the guys, because I'm ain't known to me

170
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,180
Be very+, if you praise it or like it, I'm Genike

171
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,220
But it just smells real nice

172
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,940
And now that I'm sitting back I can't bear

173
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,780
Let's go, let's go, let's go it's

174
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,660
Let's go z noticeable

175
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,920
yeah

176
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,960
yeah

177
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:39,940
I gotta wake up from

178
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,980
My mama's in charge of

179
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,980
I leave once you make up your mind

180
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,980
When you go in, I always go in

181
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,980
Come on and love me in

182
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,980
I'm not gonna get low

183
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,980
Not gonna get low

184
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,980
When you make up your mind

185
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,980
There's no reason

186
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,980
There's no reason

187
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,980
There's no reason

188
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,980
There's no reason

189
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,980
There's no reason

190
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,980
There's no reason

191
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,980
There's no reason

192
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,980
There's no reason

193
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,980
There's no reason

194
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,980
We're all our club

195
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,980
There's no reason

196
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,980
When you go in, Three, two, go

197
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,980
Brother Love, there she goes.

198
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,780
You can find him in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

199
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:53,980
Of course he's a huge pot-tick music network star.

200
00:18:53,980 --> 00:19:00,380
You know, let's do a little, a little kind of hit test here for a second.

201
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:05,900
If you can tell me who the author and composer is of this song, you'll weigh an absolutely

202
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,900
nothing.

203
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:13,540
We'll be able to find it on podshow.com slash music because he's just uploaded his first

204
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,540
track to the pod set music network.

205
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,540
Do you know it yet?

206
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,340
I'll give you a little bit of the vocals just like we're getting into the groove.

207
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,740
There you go.

208
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,940
Not one of my favorite songs by him, by the way, but a classic nonetheless.

209
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:33,580
Go find that for yourself.

210
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,580
I will not put that in the show notes.

211
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,740
Oh, this is kind of interesting.

212
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:47,020
Apple announced that a whole bunch of airlines are going to support purchasing music with

213
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,420
your iPod on the plane.

214
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:54,180
So in essence, what is being said is, if I understand the release correctly from Apple,

215
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:59,340
is that you'll be able to plug your iPod into your seat on the following airlines.

216
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:08,580
Anental delta, Dubai's Emirates, United Airlines, Air France, KLM, which is actually the

217
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,220
same.

218
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:15,420
What's funny about this is that Apple went ahead and released this.

219
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:21,940
KLM says, excuse me, it's way too early to confirm any such details as did Air France,

220
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,260
which of course is the same company now.

221
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,780
Very premature what Apple are saying is that a KLM spokesman noting that there have been

222
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,820
informal contacts between Apple and the airline, we have no idea if this is even technically

223
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,420
feasible if it's financially viable or if customers wanted, he said, at this moment,

224
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,260
we have absolutely no intention of introducing it on board, oops, little shark jumped

225
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,260
there by Apple.

226
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:46,180
Not a big one, but still, it kind of makes you wonder about all the other press releases

227
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,020
that they do seem to send out.

228
00:20:48,180 --> 00:21:00,140
Comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip,

229
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:13,740
turns out C.S.B. is a huge fan of Steve Gilmore, good fucking foot, hi Adam, so when I commute

230
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:20,740
in another gun, I have my both hands busy with one, I have to hold on to the carriage

231
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,860
and the other hand, you know, I used to go up on ladies, so we see that I have no way

232
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:32,460
to switch podcasts parts, if podcasts is split it into parts, so obviously I hated it

233
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:42,300
that Gilmore gang was split it, but it is good ship, so here are three public advices

234
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:49,180
to him, Steven Gilmore, you monkey sausage, firstly resume your podcast because many people

235
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:58,780
liked it, including set a monkey who likes to draw doodles, more, secondly, whenever this

236
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:06,060
fet me jet, calacanis, gets on your nerves, Steven, just tell him to shut the fuck up,

237
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:13,420
but don't damn him, even if he has competitive podcasts now, thirdly and lastly,

238
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:20,620
stop splitting podcasts, please, so that I could freely grow court ladies, okay, and you

239
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:26,220
Adam tells Steven that you will bring him back on serious, if you will keep it all up, you

240
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:36,060
know, I think I understood what he was saying, but he's really a big fan, he likes it,

241
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:43,260
this is what I'm here for everybody, they love the show, despite it being all the obstacles

242
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:49,740
that are put in actually getting show in one go, oh man, all right, let's do something

243
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:56,620
completely different to wind down today's show, this is actually I have been subscribed to this podcast

244
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,380
Mario Agero.blogspot.com, and I will of course put a link to that in today's show,

245
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:10,620
it's a daily source code.com, and Mario teaches at the Steven F. Austin State University in Texas

246
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:21,500
and he plays the piano, here's kind of an emager, and I suggest you just sit back, relax,

247
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:32,380
and think of wonderful things, like Splenda, co-daddy, EarthLink.

248
00:25:51,500 --> 00:26:07,340
Now, isn't that pretty? And no rights issues, no crap, no R-I-A-A, just music that's been

249
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:15,740
around for 300 years, performed by Mario Agero, it's Johan Pashal Bells, Canon and D major, and

250
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,740
you can find them on the podcast music network, it's got tracks up there, yeah, it's got some

251
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:26,620
slamming tracks from Ludwig Van, Beethoven, Robert Schumann, and Joseph Hayden, just to name a few.

252
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:35,260
Okay, well that put me in the right mood, I think, so I'll tell you what, tomorrow's going to be

253
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:40,620
pretty busy, but I'm confident I'll get a show out there, and the lady Patricia will be back

254
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:45,020
of course, I'm Friday and I hope to drag her in front of the microphone so she can tell us all about

255
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,060
her Remko experience, that's the dance guy that she's dancing with right now. By the way,

256
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:57,340
did you see in the New York Times that a renowned cardiologist said that dancing is just as good

257
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:03,660
for your heart, certainly if you have cardiac issues, as standing on a treadmill, I thought that

258
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:08,620
was very encouraging, and once again the lady Patricia is spot on, everybody take care, see tomorrow.
