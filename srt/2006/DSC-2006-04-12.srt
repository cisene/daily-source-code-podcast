You'll feel good

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Turn on your gun, move

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You'll never know, if you're right

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Come on, come on, come on

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Where are you going?

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
To me, to you know, touch me

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
No, no, no, no, no, no

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Everything's not for me

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Call it never, never, never always be

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
No, never, never, never, never

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
To me, never, never be

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No, never, never, never, never

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You're holding so much, what a place

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Why the wind is right?

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
No, never, never, never, never, never

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No, never, never, never, never

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
No, never, never, never, never

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No, never, never, never, never, never

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You're holding so much, what a place

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Why the wind is right?

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No, never, never, never, never, never

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000

No, never, never, never, never, never

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No, never, never, never, never, never, never

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
No, never, never, never, never, never

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No, never, never, never, never, never

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:04:05,160
No, never, ever!

57
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,000
No, never, never, never, never, never, be

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I won't do do do I

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm never gonna be

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You said I'm supposed to beg you please

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You know what I mean

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Turn out the lights to turn on the sun

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't mind me

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
When I finish from my side

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll tell you I need you

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm never gonna be me

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's all I've forgotten

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:54,240
Yeah, not like a bunch of racket that kick off another Charlie, huh?

69
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,480
I'm coming home, it's the red bendies, and I am home, back at the Cottage.

70
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,840
Yes, you guys look beautiful.

71
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,480
This is the Daily Source Code, episode number 365.

72
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,200
We've had a little bit of a numbering issue with the best of Charlie's, but this is the

73
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:18,000
official, the first year of the Daily Source Code.

74
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,280
That is, if you were to start on one day and play a Charlie every single day, you'd

75
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,560
take an entire year, 365 episodes.

76
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,320
And that, of course, is excluding the wonderful best of Charlie's that were created

77
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:36,800
by the Daily Source Code audience over the past, almost a week and a half fantastic.

78
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,880
I can't tell you how cool it was to listen to those every single day.

79
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:48,680
And so thanks to the bedtime stories, go first, thanks to Marcus Couch, thanks to Angie B.

80
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,800
Oh, Angie, oh, Angie, your best of Charlie was my favorite without a doubt.

81
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,800
So we've got to pick up our little love messages again, you know?

82
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,520
But it's denying that you sent me panties, puppies.

83
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,720
Also thanks, of course, to PW Fenton, who did the yesterday's best of Charlie was it to

84
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,720
mash up.

85
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,800
Oh my goodness, that was great, PW, I really appreciated that.

86
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,680
And as I was listening to it, home, I just have it here, I have it cut up on the Mac,

87
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,260
because I was listening to it.

88
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:29,600
This particular piece got Patricia laughing in a whole different part of the college.

89
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:39,720
Anyway, the, the, um, the, um, the, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh,

90
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,320
and so I fired off an email, I said, um, uh, uh, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um,

91
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,320
he dove.

92
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,400
Thanks for making yourself conscious, man.

93
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,040
Really appreciated.

94
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,000
But it was a great experiment.

95
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,240
It really, really worked.

96
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,800
And I'll make sure that, uh, we get t-shirts.

97
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,640
Oh, man, my mixer is a little cruddy.

98
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll make sure that we get t-shirts sent out to everyone to send to the best of Charlie.

99
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,320
Again, really appreciated.

100
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,160
Thank you very much.

101
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,040
It was so nice on vacation.

102
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:09,440
I was almost completely unplugged and you'd expect me to have all kinds of stories to tell

103
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,200
you, but really, it was 100% uneventful exactly the way we planned and we haven't had

104
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,560
in the sun lay down, just read some books vacation in a long time, um, one where there

105
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,040
wasn't a television production attached to it or, um, in the US when we went on vacation

106
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,280
to New York and San Francisco last time, um, we were all sick.

107
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,800
So that wasn't a real vacation.

108
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,640
We were also looking for apartments and stuff like that.

109
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,240
So that was, that was kind of a working vacation.

110
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,520
But just lay down in your ass.

111
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,400
It was great.

112
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,600
So now I can tell you what we were.

113
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:50,400
Pine cliffs, Sheraton resort in the Algarve, um, right to the east, yeah, to the east of Albufera.

114
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,680
And it was fantastic.

115
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,600
It was exactly what we wanted.

116
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,000
Right down to the buffet dinner, which is the kind of dinner we like the best because you

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,080
can kind of decide right there what you want to have.

118
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,000
And they had theme nights for the buffet dinner.

119
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,440
Oh, yes, we're very common like that.

120
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,400
I love it.

121
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,280
And the buffet breakfast, and it was fantastic.

122
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,080
It really was.

123
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,480
We hadn't been in Portugal for 23 years.

124
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,240
And boy, has a lot changed.

125
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,160
You know, of course, they'd become a new member of the European Union.

126
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,200
They spent billions of euros on infrastructure.

127
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,480
There's now actual roads.

128
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,040
You can, you can really drive from from the airport to the Algarve on on a highway.

129
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,200
And the people are just so incredibly nice.

130
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,680
And if I were to compare them to Spaniards,

131
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,440
because it'd been to Spain on vacation a lot, I have to say,

132
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,440
like the Portuguese better, really, really nice.

133
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,080
And they, of course, they have almost no industry in Portugal.

134
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,440
They have oranges, I believe.

135
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,320
They have obviously some fruits, but oranges really big.

136
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,200
And they have some textiles, like shoes and stuff that come from Portugal.

137
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,520
And the rest is pretty much tourism and golf.

138
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,000
And Patricia and I have now definitely decided

139
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,560
after having spent an entire vacation in a golf resort.

140
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,760
Hey, we should try that sometime.

141
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,720
And we will, our next door neighbors, or across the street,

142
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,040
actually, Jimmy and Marion, I think they run the golf club here near by the cottage.

143
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,880
So we'll definitely hook up with them.

144
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,040
And we're going to start trying some golf.

145
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,560
How incredibly lame is that?

146
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,040
But a lot of people seem to be into it.

147
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,920
A lot of people like it.

148
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,520
And Tiger Woods is a pretty cool dude.

149
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,240
So I guess we're going to get started on it.

150
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,000
Of course, the one thing that I'm kicking myself over

151
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,160
is that I forgot, I can't believe this.

152
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,760
I forgot my video camera.

153
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,920
So we're on vacation and I had this beautiful,

154
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,600
and I actually almost purchased it specifically to take it on vacation,

155
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
to mess around with it and do some fun stuff.

156
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,160
I left it the exacte C5.

157
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,240
I left it here at the cottage.

158
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,920
I'm such a dork.

159
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,520
God.

160
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,120
So just a bit about the trip.

161
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,880
What was really nice is, well, it wasn't nice that we couldn't get any flights

162
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,680
from the UK direct to Farrow Airport.

163
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,280
We could get them from Rotterdam.

164
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,720
And so we did something kind of different.

165
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,120
We took the channel tunnel.

166
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,280
So we drove to Folkston.

167
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,760
Thank you for the correction on the pronunciation.

168
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,120
Couple people emailed me about that.

169
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,400
Folkston.

170
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,920
And you drive right onto the train.

171
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,320
And it's about 25, 30 minutes underneath the North Sea channel.

172
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,440
And then you pop right out and all of a sudden, you're in France.

173
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,240
And of course, you're also driving on the right hand side of the road again.

174
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,200
And the speed limit is significantly higher than the UK,

175
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,000
at least in the French portion of the drive.

176
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,920
And you drive through France, drive through Belgium, pass the castle, pass right on the road

177
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,760
where we used to get off the exit to go to the castle up to Rotterdam.

178
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,280
It took a little detour, a quick stop off at Purple Rain in Brida, which is my old coffee shop

179
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,480
haunting grounds where I'd go and chill out with my Muslim brothers who have been running the shop

180
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,800
for about 20, 25 years now.

181
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,920
So it was great to see them.

182
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,480
And then we stayed at the Rotterdam Airport hotel and left the next morning, 7 AM.

183
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,480
I think would really, really early flight off to Fato.

184
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,760
It was perfect.

185
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,640
I just can't say anything else, but it was absolutely perfect.

186
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,760
And it was great with Christina.

187
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,320
We had a really good time because she, of course, is now a young woman and an adult.

188
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,080
And they're almost adult.

189
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,920
And the brains are in adult mode.

190
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,640
Let's put it that way.

191
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,280
And she's funny.

192
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,720
It was great to be with her in the same quarters without my space.

193
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,680
Because you see a lot more of your kids.

194
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,040
If there's no space around.

195
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,120
Boy, it was she Jones and hard.

196
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,760
Oh, and it's all about it.

197
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,840
That's my space has now become her email.

198
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,360
This is how these kids are using it.

199
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,560
It's fantastic.

200
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
It's almost like a subscription to people.

201
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,560
In fact, it is opting email almost.

202
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,080
And, you know, like, I keep saying, yeah, I, I send you an email.

203
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,040
She's like, I don't really email.

204
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,520
So why?

205
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,440
Because every time I go to email, there's spam.

206
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,200
I don't want to go through all the spam.

207
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,240
So I guess that that's how stuff is moving.

208
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,520
Email got so messed up that kids aren't using it anymore.

209
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,000
So she was Jones in big time.

210
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,040
Luckily, now we had a townhouse, two bedroom townhouse.

211
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,640
So there was no Wi-Fi there.

212
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,960
No hard-wired connection.

213
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,920
So you had to go into the hotel lobby and they had a vote of phone.

214
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,680
Wi-Fi hotspot, which Christina, what I did is I gave her the Mac every single day.

215
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,560
It was charged up.

216
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,840
Damn those new batteries.

217
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,880
Damn it, Apple used to have like an hour and a half charge.

218
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,720
You know, you knew your kid would be back in an hour and a half.

219
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,960
And I was like three hours until the battery runs out.

220
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,840
Pretty cool the way vote of phone has that set up.

221
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,360
By the way, you log in.

222
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,400
You get one of those splash screen pages that says, you know, you've got to pay.

223
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,200
And the way you do it is you just send a text message to a vote of phone phone number.

224
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,040
And then they text you back a code and then you use your username as your phone number.

225
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,520
And you use that code as the password.

226
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,160
And you can buy an hour or 24 hours or 72 hours.

227
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,600
And it really easy.

228
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,000
You know, no credit cards just straight to the phone bill.

229
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,320
I was using my U.S. singular cell phone.

230
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,640
So it did a straight to that number.

231
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,440
The building is all transparent and fantastic.

232
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,280
Excuse me, Sensei.

233
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,480
Yeah.

234
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,920
And I'm drinking one right now.

235
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,640
Let me tell you.

236
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,200
Portuguese, okay?

237
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,000
Great, great, great people.

238
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,760
But they got no sensei.

239
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,360
Hey, Adam, this is Travis Goss.

240
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,200
One of the hosts of the odd radio show.

241
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,920
Looks like you had a pretty good vacation.

242
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,080
It's soaking up the sod, catching some rays.

243
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,080
You know, doing all that really cool stuff.

244
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,120
While some of us had to work our asses off just to make a living.

245
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,520
Now, just plain what you're mad.

246
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,280
But seriously, how was your vacation?

247
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,720
Yeah, as I said, vacation was just dandy.

248
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,440
And I got a tan, except for that one part where, you know, if I'm sitting down,

249
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,520
then my stomach starts to kind of like bunch up into multiple packs.

250
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,480
I have a one pack.

251
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,760
You know, most guys have a six pack.

252
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,560
I have a one pack.

253
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,320
And so I've got a nice white crease there.

254
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,040
I'm the kind of guy that, he's what happens with me on vacation,

255
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,680
a gone vacation and everything starts to just release.

256
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
And please don't get the wrong idea.

257
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,920
But I get, my sinuses get blocked up.

258
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,360
I'm dead the first 48 hours.

259
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,720
I'm pretty much dead to the world.

260
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,400
I'm just, you know, complete exhaustion.

261
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,840
I just let everything go.

262
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,120
It's hard to get me out of bed.

263
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,760
And, and, you know, and then so around day three is when I start to emerge

264
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,200
and then I'll sit in the sun, only in an hour, even if it's overcast,

265
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,600
I'm the guy that's fried, you know, I get completely, completely red,

266
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,000
and then I have to be real careful for the next two days.

267
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,200
So that's about half the vacation.

268
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,600
And then I can really start to get to enjoy it.

269
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,200
Although the sinuses still are blocked up.

270
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,840
I've got a, I've got a cough, which is just kind of a lingerie.

271
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,240
It's probably been there for months and months.

272
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,600
And just as it was starting to really loosen up and, and everything was,

273
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,880
I was getting rid of everything.

274
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,920
It was time to leave.

275
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,320
And so we flew back, oh, that was cool.

276
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
On the way back home.

277
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,000
Patricia, let me see, no, we were in, so it's Transavia,

278
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,360
which, it does, you know, daily flights to Faro and Rotterdam,

279
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,080
which is, you know, on my favorite airport, even to take our own plane, too.

280
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,080
But they can land 737s on that runway.

281
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,120
And so we're sitting there and the stewardess comes back and she says,

282
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,960
to Patricia says, you know, you're, you're, you're dentist's son.

283
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,520
Now this is her first dentist from 30 years ago.

284
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,800
So he's about 80 now, but her son who is his son, who, whoops, who knows.

285
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,080
His son, who is now 41, I think, a 42.

286
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,400
He was first officer on the flight.

287
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,000
And so she had mentioned that to the, to the captain, the first officer.

288
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,960
And he said, oh, well, you know, have him come up front.

289
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,880
And so Patricia went up and was talking to him.

290
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,120
And of course, he wasn't flying the plane, the captain was.

291
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,280
And then Christina and I were both invited to go up front.

292
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,040
This is about 200 miles away from Rotterdam, somewhere over Leal in France.

293
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,240
And we're invited to go up front and sit in the jump seats.

294
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,280
And for the rest of the journey, all the way down up to the gate,

295
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,760
it was, I have to say, and I've been in a cockpit of large aircraft before.

296
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,760
You know, you can get to take a look, but actually to sit there and to witness the entire landing.

297
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,680
Whoa, that was awesome.

298
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,360
And of course, what you see is that it's exactly the same as with the Delta Shara.

299
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,960
There's literally no difference.

300
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,360
Yeah, the instruments are a little flashier looking.

301
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,200
You know, they've got glass cockpit and all that.

302
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,720
But it's the same thing.

303
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,320
And I could actually, you know, it's understand very well was happening.

304
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,520
It's like, oh, well, and actually, they told me not to tell you how easy it was,

305
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,200
because they didn't want anyone else catching up.

306
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,760
And then the next day, as we stated, the Rotterdam Hilton again,

307
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,920
we met Patricia's family came over, not the Hilton, the airport hotel,

308
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,000
but Patricia's family came over yesterday morning.

309
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,920
And then we drove off to Fox and it was, once again, it was great.

310
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,320
The, that whole channel, tunnel experiences is actually pretty damn good.

311
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:47,200
And I think if you were to go to Paris, it would probably be a pretty good train ride.

312
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
You don't have to take the car, but you can take the train ride,

313
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,040
the train, I think, from Waterloo Station.

314
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,880
That, whoops, the hell was that?

315
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,440
Oh, Skype, yes.

316
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,640
Did everyone look down at your computer thinking that you just received a Skype message?

317
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Best pieces of your podcast.

318
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,640
They sucked, so you stupid fucking stop doing some interesting content,

319
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,360
or you really be fucked up.

320
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,360
For those of you who knew to the Charlie,

321
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:42,560
comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip,

322
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,560
comic strip,

323
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,320
on, come in, come in for a second, Patricia just walked in.

324
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,560
You want to put on your headphones?

325
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,560
Actually, no, but okay.

326
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,560
Yeah, put him on for a second.

327
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,600
I think it's, I think it's all working.

328
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,400
Hey, baby.

329
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,040
Hi, honey.

330
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,840
Oh, what happened?

331
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,880
Is this higher?

332
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,840
That's weird.

333
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,560
Hey.

334
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,600
Yeah, turn over to that way.

335
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,360
Somebody used the studio here.

336
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,400
Some, I think so.

337
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,000
Our house sitter.

338
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,880
She's like, oh, no, they're gone.

339
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,480
I can finally use the studio.

340
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,280
Yeah, right.

341
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,320
So I was just telling everyone how much fun the vacation was.

342
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
Yeah, there was a lot of fun.

343
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,040
Yeah.

344
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,520
It was. I said there's nothing to report really because...

345
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,680
No, we just been very lazy.

346
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,760
Enjoyed the sun.

347
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,360
Yeah.

348
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,200
Which was, oh, what was not nice on your body, yeah.

349
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,160
Yeah.

350
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,040
I like that, because it's so cold here.

351
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,320
It's well, it's not bad today.

352
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,280
It's been a big day.

353
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,640
Actually, we brought the sun.

354
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,440
Yes, we did.

355
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:37,920
Yeah.

356
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,640
Yes, we did.

357
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,680
Yeah, so now it's nice here, but it was nice to feel the warmth on your skin.

358
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,160
And that was not just me laying on top of you.

359
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,120
And that was not you.

360
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,960
Which is sweaty butt against me.

361
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
Okay, well, thanks for joining the show.

362
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,240
And so how do you feel?

363
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,920
How do I feel?

364
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,720
I feel good.

365
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,440
I feel rested.

366
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,960
I feel energized.

367
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,560
Empower is ready to rock and roll.

368
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,240
You were so tired.

369
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,400
Yeah, I was just telling them that, you know, the first two days.

370
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,760
I'm like in coma.

371
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,160
Yeah.

372
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,200
And then I saw my sinus.

373
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,800
Every time you had fell backwards.

374
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,360
It's like, would you mouth open?

375
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,320
Is that frightening?

376
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,040
Yeah.

377
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,000
It's like I just died.

378
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,240
I thought my God, he's exhausted.

379
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,560
Yeah.

380
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,200
Well, I am.

381
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,440
Well, all that flying back and forth.

382
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:25,920
Yeah.

383
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,200
Oh, there was an article.

384
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,920
Hold on a second.

385
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,560
You'll like this.

386
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,600
Mm-hmm.

387
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,640
Tom Schoobling sent this.

388
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,800
That's the guy that that archives all of the Korean van in

389
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,640
goals, and all my radio shows on the internet.

390
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,920
The guys in Australia.

391
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,640
Oh, yeah.

392
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,040
He sent an article from the BBC that the researchers have now

393
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,800
discovered, let me see where it is here.

394
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,800
If you wear sunglasses when you're flying westwards for jet lag.

395
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,160
If you wear sunglasses, then you're buying.

396
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,960
Oh, yeah.

397
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,840
Your brain.

398
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,480
Yeah, thanks.

399
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:56,960
Thanks.

400
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,680
Tonight, and then it will basically say the lower level, and you won't be as tired.

401
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,880
Good idea.

402
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,440
Yeah.

403
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,800
Of course, you look like an asshole on the planet.

404
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,160
Well, I find the whole thing.

405
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:11,280
Once on TV about dark and about when it's getting dark outside, how you

406
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,200
body just shuts down and.

407
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,960
Well, my wake up when it starts to get dark.

408
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,480
Ha ha ha.

409
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,680
Yeah.

410
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,720
Yeah.

411
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,360
Yes.

412
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,200
So does my daughters, actually?

413
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,480
Well, what do you expect?

414
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,680
You guys don't want to sleep.

415
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,240
There's too much going on in the world, huh?

416
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,840
Yeah, it's just too much happening.

417
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,480
I know.

418
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:28,640
Okay.

419
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,960
But anyway, so it looks like I'll be around the cottage for.

420
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,480
Yeah, but there's no food in the house.

421
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,600
So that sucks.

422
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,400
You say you walk in, you say, hey, you have an eating yet.

423
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,000
No, because I've been down stairs.

424
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,880
Because there's no food.

425
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,760
Well, of course, a mom always can find something in the house,

426
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,600
and prepare you something.

427
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,360
You know, there's some bacon, some eggs.

428
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,600
Yeah.

429
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,880
I know you would like that.

430
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,240
But first, do you show?

431
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,880
Yes.

432
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,680
And when you're done.

433
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,640
And then I get a reward.

434
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,440
A little gold star.

435
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,640
Is that your reward?

436
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
Oh, that's pretty nice.

437
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,680
Thank you.

438
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,320
Oh, thank you.

439
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,600
So it's good to be back.

440
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,640
Yeah, definitely.

441
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,160
And I'm going to be around for a while.

442
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,760
Yeah.

443
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,160
Yeah.

444
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,840
And then the two of us will come to.

445
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,240
Uh, then the two of us are going to go San Francisco.

446
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,600
We're going to Pebble Beach.

447
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,240
Yeah.

448
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,680
You know, maybe we should hook up with Jimmy and Mary and before that,

449
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,480
and start golfing.

450
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,240
Because Pebble Beach is the golf.

451
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,880
I told him we're going to start golfing.

452
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,640
Yeah, we were actually vacationing.

453
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,200
Um,

454
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,720
Yeah, a great golfer.

455
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,760
Yeah, golf resort.

456
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,000
Yeah.

457
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,360
And we're looking at going like, oh, you know, maybe we should do that.

458
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,000
Yeah.

459
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,800
I mean, it's good cardio vascular exercise for you.

460
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,800
Oh, yeah.

461
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,000
Yeah, of course it is.

462
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,320
Why do you think all those guys with heart attacks to golf?

463
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,080
You think so?

464
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,720
Yeah.

465
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,720
It's supposed to be fantastic for your heart.

466
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,600
Yeah, I mean, you see.

467
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,520
They didn't look very hip, did they?

468
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,480
I don't know.

469
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,840
Wait, if you know how I always, it's so funny.

470
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,440
Because every time I see sort of people of my age,

471
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,760
I always say, oh, there's a lot of old people here.

472
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,480
And I think, oh my god, I'm actually the same age.

473
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,080
And I forget all the time.

474
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,720
And Mary, I can grow.

475
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,160
Because I don't feel that way.

476
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,720
And Mary, I congratulate you on your birthday.

477
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,120
Because we only celebrated it privately.

478
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,080
It has to be on your birthday.

479
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,880
Yes, we have to.

480
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,480
When you get that, it's true.

481
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,760
April 7th, Patricia had a birthday.

482
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,160
Yeah.

483
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,760
I guess we don't say how old you are anymore.

484
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,200
That's we don't talk about that now.

485
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,600
Yeah.

486
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,040
It comes to a point in a woman's life.

487
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,320
It's so disappointing.

488
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,240
You know, so many things I have to do.

489
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,160
Disappointing.

490
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,560
Yeah, I just, I remember when I was 18, 19,

491
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,200
I always love my birthdays.

492
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,520
Yeah.

493
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,520
I was like, oh my god, it's my birthday.

494
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:35,840
Yeah.

495
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,440
But now you think, oh shit.

496
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,520
Yeah, what was that we heard yesterday?

497
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,880
When up until you're 40, you're living.

498
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,280
What was that?

499
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,600
I can't remember it.

500
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,960
It was actually very good.

501
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,440
It was so good.

502
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,240
I can't remember it.

503
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,760
Is you're living away from death?

504
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,640
And after you're 40,

505
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,680
you're living towards death?

506
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,640
It was something like that.

507
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,360
Yeah, something like that.

508
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:57,520
Yeah.

509
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,320
God, we're stupid.

510
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,120
Can't remember that.

511
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,080
No, it was good.

512
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,920
We both, yeah, it's true.

513
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,120
Yeah.

514
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,360
Yeah.

515
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:04,720
Oh, hold on.

516
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,920
It's like, hold on.

517
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,400
Oh my gosh.

518
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,360
You know what this means, don't you?

519
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,360
You can't hear it?

520
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:35,040
Well, anyway.

521
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,240
I think that this is me.

522
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,040
Yeah.

523
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,680
No, he's not.

524
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,480
That's not you.

525
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,200
That means P-Dob was going to close the satellite window.

526
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,240
And we'll check you guys out on serious tomorrow here

527
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,600
on the daily source code.

528
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,960
Can't believe you couldn't hear any of that.

529
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,000
No.

530
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,880
I didn't even know, did I thought, do you hear yourself?

531
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,920
Did the headphones?

532
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,600
Then why do you, why are you wearing that?

533
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Why don't you tell the engineer that your headphones

534
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,720
aren't working, baby?

535
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:57,920
You're not.

536
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,640
That's all I said.

537
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,520
It's professional.

538
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,640
I'm not going to mention.

539
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,120
Put them on.

540
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,240
Put them on.

541
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,200
Let's do it.

542
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,480
So work.

543
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,440
You hear anything at all?

544
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,320
No, no, no.

545
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,120
It doesn't matter.

546
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,920
Yeah, it does.

547
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,280
Of course, you turn around here.

548
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,720
My, my wire's not long enough.

549
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,640
Okay, let's see.

550
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,360
Does that work?

551
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:13,920
No.

552
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,800
You're kidding me.

553
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,120
No, I'm just not plugged in somewhere.

554
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,080
You are plugged in.

555
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,720
It doesn't matter.

556
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,840
It's not interesting.

557
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,480
No, it's not interesting, but it's annoying,

558
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,600
because then you can't react to all the...

559
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,400
Yeah, that's the next time.

560
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,120
It's all right.

561
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,600
Okay.

562
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,760
I'm going to have to go downstairs anyway.

563
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,640
I understand.

564
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,600
I understand.

565
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,640
I've alienated you.

566
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,120
Okay.

567
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,920
Okay, baby.

568
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,720
You want to?

569
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,600
Yes.

570
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,480
Uh-huh.

571
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,440
Oh, yes, please.

572
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,880
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, please.

573
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,160
Okay.

574
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,480
Bye.

575
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:38,960
Bye, baby.

576
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,520
Love you.

577
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,000
Bye.

578
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,720
All right, see you later.

579
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,000
Okay.

580
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,720
The lovely intelligence and misputure-share-py, everybody.

581
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,640
Okay, so one more thing I'm really excited about.

582
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,000
This Saturday, the 15th.

583
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,960
And that kind of ties into comic strip blogger,

584
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,520
because he was going to be in the UK on the 15th.

585
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,720
And he said, he sent me an email saying he wanted to interview me

586
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,840
on some neutral ground, but he's only here for one day.

587
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,800
And unfortunately, the 15th, this has been planned for a couple of weeks.

588
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,280
Wing Commander William is bringing the plane over from Antwerp Airport,

589
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,440
the November 277 Delta Sierra.

590
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,520
He'll be arriving 9 a.m.

591
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,080
I think at Fair Oaks.

592
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,920
And then from there, Captain Dan and I,

593
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,200
and the Wing Commander, fly back to Antwerp.

594
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,520
So we're basically shuddling the Wing Commander back.

595
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,480
And then Captain Dan and I will fly back to the UK again.

596
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,160
So it's going to be a full day of flying.

597
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,160
The point is, though, I have a safety pilot.

598
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,960
And I had a long chat with Captain Dan last night on the phone.

599
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,480
First time we actually spoken on the phone.

600
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,640
Sounds like a great guy's little bit older than I am,

601
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,480
but very experienced pilot.

602
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,040
And knows a shit load about what's going on in aviation in these neck

603
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,680
of the woods.

604
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,440
He even turned me on to another airport,

605
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,600
which is just 15 minutes from the house.

606
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,760
And it's an X-R-A-F testing center

607
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,600
where they actually built the Harrier Jet.

608
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,400
It's called Dunsfold, Dunsfold Park Airfield.

609
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,840
It's a private airfield, but I can get a hanger there immediately.

610
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,280
And you can even land a Gulfstream G5,

611
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:12,560
because it has the most, you know, an incredibly long and wide runway.

612
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,560
So it's, I'm very jazzed about all that.

613
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,200
And the fact that I'm going to be around for a couple of weeks,

614
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,120
means I might actually get some flying in.

615
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,080
How cool would that be?

616
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,760
Meanwhile, back at the ranch, and I'm just catching up on everything.

617
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,240
All, you know, there's so much to catch up on

618
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,120
of what's been happening at Pod Show headquarters,

619
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,600
Pod Show LA, and even Pod Show UK.

620
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,880
Let me let you know.

621
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,960
And I've shadowed four walls,

622
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,400
all two secrets some will kill to protect.

623
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,160
And others will die to expose,

624
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:50,000
because it is on this ground that the very first battle of Armageddon

625
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,360
has been waged for over 300 years.

626
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,800
A battle that will finally be decided once.

627
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,360
I should have prefaced that by saying this is just a voice test

628
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,600
from our voice for Shadow Falls, which is coming very soon.

629
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,200
Shadow Falls, coming this spring to the Pod Show podcast network.

630
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,280
Pod Show LA is rocking, man.

631
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,840
There's so much talent that is waiting on tables in California.

632
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,480
And they're just like, everyone's showing up with great ideas.

633
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,000
And, you know, they all want to just everyone wants to work.

634
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,080
You know, it's so, it's so unbelievable how many people are just trying to get

635
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,560
shit done, really is, you know, whatever it is.

636
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,080
And to be able to do stuff with no rules, no boundaries,

637
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,440
and come up with your own ideas, it's really working in Pod Show LA.

638
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,240
Pod Show UK, we'll tell you about that.

639
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,280
At the, let me see, the end of this month, Ron's coming over.

640
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,320
And he actually is also bringing his wife, Marta,

641
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,920
and I think KJ is coming over.

642
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,800
So it's going to be a good fun, week in London.

643
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,800
As we're meeting with a number of different companies, partners, clients,

644
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,920
customers, advertisers, podcasters, et cetera.

645
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,800
And actually, I think we should try and set up a couple of a couple of,

646
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,280
I don't know if we could do a, like a podcaster, a UK podcaster,

647
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,040
meet and greet, hang out, chill, drink some pints, you know, throw some

648
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,400
darts, get together.

649
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,840
That actually might be a good idea.

650
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,720
I'll, I'll see if I can get on the agenda on the schedule.

651
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,440
As soon as possible, because it's going to fill up really, really fast.

652
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,240
But it looks like stuff's getting pretty serious.

653
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,960
And of course, then, I'll have to change on my tax status and stuff,

654
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,640
because it'll actually be working here as well.

655
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,920
And that does kind of suck, but hey, anyway.

656
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,320
So that's what's coming up in the future of cheesemen.

657
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,920
We know, I haven't even had a chance to look at all the work that's been done

658
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:54,080
on Pod Show Plus, the MASH board, the PDN, Pod Save Music Network,

659
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,920
all that stuff coming together in the next days, slash weeks.

660
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,160
Not quite sure.

661
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,240
I don't even know what the unleash schedule is now.

662
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,000
I mean, there's so much to talk about.

663
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,240
But to my tomorrow, I'll be much better educated.

664
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,000
I promise you, I'll know exactly what's going on.

665
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,640
A nice welcome home gift from Jeff Smith, the legendary Jeff Smith.

666
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,720
You know, he said, you know, I've got a song for you.

667
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,280
You should check it out at some of my, uh, my, uh, dot Mac, I disk.

668
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,800
So you're going to do his public folder.

669
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,320
And, you know, so I pulled the song out.

670
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,720
And they're like, wow, you know, there's a whole bunch of stuff here for other podcasters.

671
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,640
And just so you know, when I commissioned Jeff to do something,

672
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,760
I, you know, Pod Show Paism, I do plan to do that work.

673
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,080
Like the evil Pod Show song and stuff like that.

674
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,600
And Jeff is so unbelievable.

675
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,040
He, in real life, he, uh, he does a lot of gigs.

676
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,720
He's a, he's a real working musician, plays a crazy piano bar.

677
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,360
So that's how it's so easy for him to just shake all this stuff out.

678
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,000
You know, and it sounds so catchy and hokey and it's great.

679
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,320
But it really does seem like he's getting his act together.

680
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
He's got some ringtone sales going on.

681
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,200
It looks like he's producing stuff for other podcasts.

682
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,640
I think he even did something for for gig brief TV.

683
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,920
So, you know, maybe part of the dream is becoming reality for this guy, you know.

684
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,760
Anyway, it's song about it.

685
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,840
Except I got my dream.

686
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:32,880
I'm gonna quit my day job too, just like you.

687
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,520
Okay, okay.

688
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,360
I got a punch at clock.

689
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,760
I got to pay my dues.

690
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,520
Oh, yes, it's true.

691
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,040
I'm gonna quit my day job too, just like you.

692
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,240
I was made for more than just being someone's too.

693
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,680
I can make my own show.

694
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:23,280
Hey, I'm gonna quit my day job too, just like you.

695
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,760
I'm gonna make it in my little room.

696
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
You're gonna all download it soon.

697
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,440
Yes, it's true.

698
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:46,080
I'm gonna quit my day job too, just like you.

699
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,480
Oh, yes, I'm gonna quit my day job.

700
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,960
I'm gonna quit my day job too, just like you.

701
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,960
Oh, yes, I'm gonna quit my day job too, just like you.

702
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,960
I'm now my bandwidth is not enough.

703
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,840
My server blew out in above.

704
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,680
My RSS feed might be lost forever.

705
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,680
How did ever come to this rate?

706
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,040
Did we get so big?

707
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,000
Suscriptions go in through the roof.

708
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,720
And overnight without a clue.

709
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,440
Looks like our dreams are comming.

710
00:33:45,440 --> 00:34:00,720
Oh, yes, I'm gonna quit my day job too, just like you.

711
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:15,280
Oh, yes, I'm gonna quit my day job too, just like you.

712
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,280
I'm gonna quit my day job too, just like you.

713
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:30,560
Oh, yes, I'm gonna quit my day job too, just like you.

714

722
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,060
Warning, consumption of this program,

723
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,560
make me foot down the headbag,

724
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,560
you know, control the latch

725
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,560
for business or hanging over onions

726
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,560
into the pouring the two audience.

727
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,560
I never saw anything.

728
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,560
Internet is for before.

729
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,560
And work daily one in the museum and in the editing.

730
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,560
Oh, my favorite part.

731
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560
It makes sense.

732
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,560
It makes sense.

733
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,560
It makes sense.

734
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,560
It makes sense.

735
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,560
It makes sense.

736
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,560
I get it.

737
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,560
Nowadays,

738
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,560
it's already a free item.

739
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,560
I'll give you an end to shoot.

740
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,560
It's a good job.

741
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,560
Today is a great week, man.

742
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
That's my official job here.

743
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,560
Proxpress and mail driver

744
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,560
Painters, we need to be done need not.

745
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,560
They need mail service.

746
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,560
I'm sorry.

747
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
I'm sorry.

748
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
I'm sorry.

749
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
I'm sorry.

750
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,560
Oh, my word.

751
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,560
That was nice.

752
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,560
That was nice.

753
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,560
Let me freaking tell ya.

754
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,560
If you can't stay with the heat.

755
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,560
Stay on the net.

756
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,560
Oh, that's nice.

757
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,560
You trust.

758
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,560
Proxpress.

759
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,560
There you are.

760
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,560
Thank you.

761
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,560
Buddy, open the door.

762
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,560
Open the door.

763
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,560
Open the door.

764
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,560
That chair.

765
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,560
Hello.

766
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,560
Hey.

767
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,560
Okay.

768
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,560
My name is 14th of this podcast brought to you by Acveut.

769
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,560
Check out heather and janella.ow.hicive.com.

770
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,560
This is great.

771
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,560
It's talking about my space and the I have to reiterate one more time.

772
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:19,560
Parents, if you Werew一点 about what's going on in my space land and what your kids do in there, open in account.

773
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:24,340
kids do in there, open an account, you know, find out what your kids' profile is on my

774
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,100
space and keep tabs on them.

775
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,100
It's completely honest and legal and open.

776
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,540
You can do that and lay them up the place if you don't like it.

777
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:36,700
You know, post lots of really lame pictures and bulletins on on your kids' my space

778
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,940
like time to come to dinner, you know, it'll really work.

779
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,100
Trust me on that.

780
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:46,740
But it doesn't seem a lot of people trust me because myspace.com has now hired the very

781
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,740
first.

782
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,980
This is great.

783
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:58,020
Chief Security Officer from the New York Times, and I love the way the New York Times

784
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,860
of Maria Newman wrote this.

785
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,200
Here's how the New York Times tells you what myspace is.

786
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,320
Myspace.com, the social network and internet site popular with young people that has

787
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:12,000
alarmed some parents and law enforcement officials concerned about sexual predators, announced

788
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
yesterday.

789
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,960
It was hiring a former federal prosecutor to be its first security chief officer.

790
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:22,020
Yahoo, now the guy's name is great.

791
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,820
He man's shoe, knee gum.

792
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,260
He man's shoe is here to protect your children.

793
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,260
Dudes, dudes, dudes, dudes.

794
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:37,380
So, they're so doing that to cover Fox's ass, you know, and it's all about the stock price.

795
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,800
Believe me, this entire acquisition of my space by Fox, and it helped look at their share

796
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,800
price.

797
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,740
That's what it was done for, and it was funny because I was listening to the Guardian

798
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:52,740
on one of the Guardian newspaper podcasts here, and they were talking about that the whole

799
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:58,460
plan behind the Myspace acquisition was to connect that audience with the Sun newspaper,

800
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:02,840
which of course is a Murdoch property here in the UK, because the Sun's circulation

801
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:08,940
is dropped significantly, and apparently that's the flagship publication is really important.

802
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,540
So, who knows?

803
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,540
I think it's still all just about stock price.

804
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,420
I hope that don't mess it up though, because Myspace is definitely cool.

805
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:20,020
And I love just looking at how excited Christina gets now that she's understanding how to

806
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,020
paced in codes.

807
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,980
I mean, that's the beauty of this thing.

808
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:29,700
It's so, so feature poor, really, that, but they've let all these little pieces open,

809
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,780
that, you know, you can create different backgrounds and put other modules and stuff onto it.

810
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,620
Lots of good ideas there.

811
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:41,740
Of course, we've taken some of those thoughts and put them into Pod Show Plus, which, well,

812
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,940
it's coming very soon.

813
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,940
Very, very soon.

814
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:50,940
I love to launch it along with Shadow Falls and our bone game show and stuff.

815
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,580
We'll be cool if we could kind of bring that all together at the same time.

816
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:59,140
Anyway, he managed you now looking after the safety of your children on Myspace.

817
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:07,140
Hey Adam, this is Steve Runner from the podcast, Fidipidations at SteveRunner.com.

818
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:12,220
Fidipidations is a tough name to pronounce, but it's to show about running any title pays

819
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:18,620
homage to the first marathoner of ancient Greece fame, Fidipidies, a messenger that

820
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:24,180
legends says ran all the way from the plains of Marathon to proclaim Athens victory over

821
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,500
the Spartans.

822
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:33,460
Upon entering the city, Fidipidies was said to have shouted, rejoice, we conquer him and he died

823
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,980
of a heart attack.

824
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:41,580
This year, I'll be podcasting as I run the 110th Boston marathon on Patriots Day, April

825
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:46,620
17th from the plains of Hopkins in Massachusetts to downtown Boston.

826
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:50,620
I've been training for this thing since December and I feel pretty confident that I'm

827
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,620
going to win it this year.

828
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:56,140
Well, okay, I might not win it.

829
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:00,140
But I'm fairly certain that I will drop dead about heart attack when I finish.

830
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:05,620
One thing that I'm absolutely certain of is that I'll win the England podcaster's division

831
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,140
of the race.

832
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:12,460
This is the first time that anyone will be actually podcasting as they run the Boston

833
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,700
marathon and I promise that it won't be boring.

834
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:23,340
See, I'm just an average guy, a 44 year old, slightly as manic, middle of the pack, runner

835
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:27,660
who offers a non-elete perspective on running.

836
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,860
So you never know what's going to happen.

837
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:35,700
I'll even be wearing a computer chip that will email listeners in real time as I'm running

838
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,940
of course.

839
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:44,460
So everybody can be there with me through the internet as I, runner number 23116, runs the

840
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,900
26.2 miles to Boston.

841
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:52,620
If you've ever thought about running a marathon and figured it would be impossible, check

842
00:41:52,620 --> 00:42:00,020
out my weekly show, Fit Dependations at SteveRunter.com, thoughts, opinions, observations, and

843
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:05,500
rambling dietrads about running, composed during distance long runs.

844
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:13,220
In an April as I run the Boston marathon, thanks Adam, and it's we runners like to say

845
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:16,740
run long and taper.

846
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:21,100
Steve, you're an animal dude and I don't know how you're going to do it, running the

847
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:26,460
Boston marathon is one thing, but then talking and doing a podcast at the same time, dude,

848
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,460
I want to sponsor you.

849
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:31,780
I don't know if you can, if it's a sponsorable event, I presume it is, I'd love for you

850
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,980
to be wearing a pod show T-shirt.

851
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,540
Just let me know, shoot me an email.

852
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,820
I'd love to sponsor this.

853
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,180
This is a great idea.

854
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,300
And I'm not going to go to this whole thing is with the chip you're wearing that emails

855
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,540
people in real time, but I want in, man, that's great.

856
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,540
I really do.

857
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:50,260
And I've listened to this Steve runner podcast and it's unbelievable how you can, you know,

858
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:56,180
keep up that, that physique of running and talking and, hey, so doing that on the marathon

859
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,180
will be great.

860
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,180
Please, let me know if we can sponsor, I want in.

861
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,180
Oh, this is nice.

862
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:08,020
This is a podcast Patricia's going to get really turned on by when I, when I, when I

863
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:13,900
subscriber to it, I'll watch you a plus.

864
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,900
Hi, Adam.

865
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,980
Luke Stanley here, longtime listener of the Charlie.

866
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,180
That is me playing Chalo in the background.

867
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:26,140
I really liked your comment a few weeks ago about being a tour, rather than a

868
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,140
talker.

869
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:33,140
So, I was thinking, classical music avoids so many copyright issues and so it is great

870
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,140
for podcasting.

871
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:39,140
So, I made a video podcast of me playing the Chalo live.

872
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:44,700
The feedback has been great and I'm absolutely amazed by having a chance to communicate

873
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,700
with an audience.

874
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,260
Podcasting is amazing in that way.

875
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:56,100
Please visit my video podcast called Chalo Journey that's C-E-L-O-O-O-D.

876
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:02,100
You can listen and see what Chalo playing is all about.

877
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,100
Thanks, Adam.

878
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:09,340
You know, I got to say, um, Chalo playing is hot, man.

879
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,140
It really is.

880
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,140
It's hot.

881
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,940
I mean, not when guys do it, but when women play the Chalo, oh, God, that's so, that's so

882
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:16,940
sexual.

883
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,660
If you know what I mean.

884
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:22,940
Angie B. Do you play the Chalo by any chance?

885
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:28,260
I once met Paula's on back in the MTV days when she was still cool, before she, I don't

886
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:34,140
like, you know, she's, she's gotten to Mary Hart like kind of, I don't know what it is.

887
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,740
Got an uncool in my book and I'm going to talk, right?

888
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:40,340
Being the uncool is bastard of the blogs.

889
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:44,820
But when she was still cool, I met her and she told me she plays Chalo and then she sent

890
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,260
me an autograph picture of her playing Chalo.

891
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,620
You know, black dress.

892
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:55,100
Hey, the French, gosh, man, you know, you go on vacation and then the French protests

893
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:59,300
actually worked in that something.

894
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:04,260
And yesterday, Tuesday, there was another protest.

895
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:09,420
So they got the labor law dropped or cut from the new law package.

896
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:18,660
And this was about employers being able to fire new hires at whim within two years, like

897
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:24,740
a two year trial period, excuse me, since sale again, which, of course, you know my

898
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,900
opinion on that.

899
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:31,740
So it got dropped, got cut from the package and then they celebrated with another protest

900
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:36,620
on Tuesday and said, hey, we got a couple more things that were pissed off about.

901
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:37,620
It's not, man.

902
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:41,860
I read a great, it was in the financial times, I think, I read over the holiday about

903
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,500
the French.

904
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:48,180
And this was a very anti French article, I bet I think it was.

905
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:51,740
And the article said, well, you know, it's here's how it works in France.

906
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:55,740
On Monday, just about everything's closed anyway, they have a 35 hour work week in France,

907
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,620
35 or 36 hour work week.

908
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:03,340
So Monday, just about everything's closed Tuesday, Wednesdays, all the kids are, you know,

909
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:08,940
have half a day at school, so everything is, you know, so do a lot of offices apparently.

910
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,780
And on Friday, it's, you know, Friday is weekend, man.

911
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:12,780
That's not for work.

912
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,780
And so that leaves Tuesdays and Thursdays and getting anything done.

913
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,060
And guess which days, all the protests are held on.

914
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,060
Yep, Tuesday.

915
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,500
So it really leaves Thursday with the last day to work.

916
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:25,340
Man, man, man, I don't know if you've been to Paris recently, but Patricia came back

917
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:29,540
and she said, man, it's dirty and it's skunky and people are, don't look very happy.

918
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:36,940
And so, uh, and of course, there's no real homecoming without our friend from the UK.

919
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:56,340
Yeah, I just wanted to explain, that the, the, actually on your lawn was a genuine mistake.

920
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:02,280
I had the little accident with a candle on Thursday, but the manage to stop things spreading

921
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,280
towards the house.

922
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,880
There's no need to worry while you're on your holiday, so it'll probably grow

923
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,880
you know, you're just lucky I was there really.

924
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,880
Anyway, I just wanted to just send you a little message

925
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,880
so that you know that I'm thinking of you

926
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,880
and also I'm keeping a safe eye on the house.

927
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,880
I'm just picturing you in Portugal

928
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,880
and you look at the speed,

929
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:20,880
those eating a chocache,

930
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,880
while you galloping on your little donkey

931
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,880
along the beach and slow motion.

932
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,880
You must look like a modern day Jesus

933
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,880
on that down K,

934
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,880
whereas Jesus turned water into wine

935
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,880
you can turn shit into petrol,

936
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,880
which probably has more commercial value

937
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,880
in today's society.

938
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,880
Anyway, enough about that.

939
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,880
I actually wanted to warn you,

940
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,880
that I've just looked at Portugal on the internet

941
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,880
and you might be in danger

942
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,880
of a very nasty jellyfish called

943
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,880
the Portuguese Man of War.

944
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,880
I'll attach a picture of it with this email

945
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,880
so you know not to poke it with the stick

946
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:52,880
if you see the little fella.

947
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,880
Just cross the road.

948
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,880
Now, you can try one of two things

949
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,880
if you get stern.

950
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,880
The first is to pee on yourself

951
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,880
because the chemicals help neutralize the poison

952
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,880
and the second is to call the doctor.

953
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,880
So, take a take there.

954
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,880
Sure, they can say not mine.

955
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,880
Maybe you can get your little donkey

956
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,880
to pee on your swallowing.

957
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,880
I don't know.

958
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,880
Actually, when I was really young,

959
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,880
I went to a seaside

960
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,880
and don't keep pee on me.

961
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,880
I thought it was a little cow

962
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:20,880
that needed milking.

963
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,880
Ursula can child food story

964
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:23,880
as mine.

965
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,880
Personally, I prefer to get stern by jellyfish

966
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,880
and have the horrible stinging sensation in my eyes again.

967
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,880
But one thing I do know

968
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,880
that thing is good for is putting our fires on someone's lawn.

969
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,880
Just because we don't get birds.

970
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,880
Anyway, how do you get back safely?

971
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,880
Yes, I'm missing hearing your lovely warm voice.

972
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,880
So, bye for now.

973
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,880
Roger, thank you so much

974
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,880
and of course, I heard this before the show today.

975
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,880
So, I went out and I walked around the house

976
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,880
to see if I could find the dark patch

977
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,880
and I think I found what you're talking about, Roger.

978
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,880
Now, we had about half a foot of snow here

979
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,880
while we were gone.

980
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,880
So, I probably got rid of any dark patches,

981
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,880
but there's a couple dark patches in dude.

982
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,880
Don't do that.

983
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,880
Thank you for watching the house, Roger.

984
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,880
Really appreciate it.

985
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,880
Oh, yes, good to be back.

986
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,880
Also, notice by the way,

987
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,880
Roger has completed a Google bomb

988
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,880
for Mark Fondalinda.

989
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,880
That's the editor of that rag that stole my pictures flicker.

990
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,880
Go ahead, type it in Google Mark Fondalinda.

991
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,880
You might have a laugh.

992
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,880
It's Future Street.

993
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,880
From the pot saved music never.

994
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,880
It's not long to be.

995
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,880
We're all sweet.

996
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,880
Never need to worry.

997
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,880
We're everything.

998
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,880
It's not defined by what we see.

999
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,880
There are almost things.

1000
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,880
It's never meant to worry.

1001
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,880
Never meant to be.

1002
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,880
Don't mean to be.

1003
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,880
We're bound to be late.

1004
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,880
And I'd rather be.

1005
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,880
Totally committed to the dream.

1006
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,880
And I'll tell you.

1007
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,880
Till it's right.

1008
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,880
The way where it's going to be.

1009
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,880
Don't let me go.

1010
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,880
Some head touches the way they speak.

1011
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:47,880
And I'll tell you just what you love is in my mind.

1012
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,880
Baby me.

1013
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,880
Down on future street.

1014
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,880
And baby by then I'll know.

1015
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,880
About the plans for you and me.

1016
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,880
Oh, baby me.

1017
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,880
Down on future street.

1018
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,880
And baby by then I'll know.

1019
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,880
About the plans for you and me.

1020
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,880
Yeah, I'll those things.

1021
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,880
I want some days.

1022
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,880
Hey, now.

1023
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,880
Strolling Brooklyn from the name of the team.

1024
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,880
And all the rest.

1025

Show me the way.

1026
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,880
But it's me.

1027
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,880
Because I've been down this way before.

1028
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,880
Don't ask me.

1029
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,880
Because I think it's just the way it makes me.

1030
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,880
And I know when I'm still loving him.

1031

And baby by then I'll know.

1059
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,880
You know, when you listen to song like this from the pod say music network,

1060
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,880
think yourself.

1061
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,880
Man, how poor is American idol?

1062
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,880
You know, how lame is the talent there that is being

1063
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:04,880
loaded and applauded.

1064
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,880
It's just not to be compared.

1065
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,880
That's Martha Redbone, New York based American Indian singer.

1066
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,880
On the pod say music network future street.

1067
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,880
You can find that a music dot pod showed our comment.

1068
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,880
Of course, I'll put a link in the show notes.

1069
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:17,880

1070
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,880
Hey, that's it for today.

1071
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,880
Going to close down.

1072
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:20,880
Got lots of stuff to do.

1073
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,880
San Francisco wakes up in a couple hours.

1074
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,880
So as I said, I still got a dive head first and everything.

1075
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,880

1076
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:28,880

1077
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,880
And of course.

1078
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,880
I'll tell you all about it once I know.

1079
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,880
So I don't know what's going to be happening this week.

1080
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,880
Good Friday, of course, on the way.

1081
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,880
So we may.

1082
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,880
I don't know.

1083
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,880
I guess, you know, folks at pod show, man.

1084
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,880
They don't like to go home for anything.

1085
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,880
So I don't know if they're working on a Friday.

1086
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,880
But lots of lots of good stuff coming up in the next couple of weeks.

1087
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:49,880
Going to be here at the cottage.

1088
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,880
Plan is to have Patricia on the podcast a couple more times.

1089
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,880
And hello, dear.

1090
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,880
Can you tell how many I'm going on the taxi here?

1091
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,880
Oh, you're going to go into town.

1092
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,880
You look pretty.

Yeah.

1105
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,880

1106
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,880
Yeah.

1107
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,880
