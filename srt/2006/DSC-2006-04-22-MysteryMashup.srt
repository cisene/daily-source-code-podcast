1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The thy father knows, the thy father knows

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Walking down the street on a foggy night, wearing sunglasses, me and my partner show my hair

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
On hunt the suit of a guy called, the thy father

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The thy father knows, the thy father knows

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Keep your eye on podshow.com, because pretty soon we're going to help people all that

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I think once we get our podcasters up and rolling, and there's a shitload of them

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We're going to be bandwidthing, y'all kinds of support, and that work support if you will

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Then we're going to go after you, we're coming to get you 100 million listeners

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Sixty million dollars worth of air playing strap to my ass

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's time once again for the Charlie Daily source code is on for Wednesday

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
How are you doing today?

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
They met in Paris in 94, oh was it 95?

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
She was there studying abroad, he was on tour, playing in another dime

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
They partied hard in the pocketweights, a little north of the sand

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He dreamed about her in so many ways

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
She dreamed about her in French

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well she knows what to do with my coat

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
She knows how to make it feel

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He knew that he's the one, he's the mother's son, not like anyone

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Just needs time to heal

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
They met in New York a few months later

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
He was still living alone

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hugging the ball and masturbating

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Never answered his phone

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Their first date was a movie together

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Outside of Brian Park

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And the spirit of St. Louis

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Just went on for a meal until they drank wine

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Until they saw us cause

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh she knows what to do with my coat

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
She knows how to make it feel

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He knew that he's the one, he's the mother's son, not like anyone

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Just needs time to heal

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They finally hooked up

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:25,000
For the first time

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The night before the Fourth of July

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He fell so awkward saying goodbye

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Into the girl who just changed his life

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Now my friend, they are in separate bars

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
She even gets that boy to go to the gym

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Now if you don't think that's love

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You must be standing calm

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Oh make it man, you're just dreaming in friends

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, because she knows what to do with my coat

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
She knows how to make it feel

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He's the mother's son, not like anyone

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Just needs time to heal

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Well she knows what to do with my coat

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He knows how to make it feel

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He's the mother's son, not like anyone

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And she just needs time to heal

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah, he's the one, he's the mother's son

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Not like anyone

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And just need a time to heal

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Well that's right, he just need a time to heal

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
By requests, candy butchers, what to do with Michael?

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Mike Viola at his best

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Nick Zitler requested that one from the pod safe music

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Now where he calls it a pod safe classic

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh my goodness, I don't know about that

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But it's definitely a good song

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You can find that at music.podshow.com

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000

When you get all the info in the wiki base show notes

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
At show notes.ingfo

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Well hey everybody, how you doing?

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Welcome to the daily source code

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The Charlie is on from the cottage

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
In the affluent suburb of Guilford in Surrey

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
In the United Kingdom

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And this morning after dropping Christina off at school

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I jetted back to the cottage

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So come home

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's like nine o'clock

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And then I almost automatically

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Gravitated towards a big guy, porn

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You know, is this a homosexuality thing

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I didn't actually realize that until I just pulled up the

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Cartoon of the profit Muhammad

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You know, Americans are freaked out by that

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What is it with it with you know

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Is this a metro sexual moment

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And you know

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I don't think I have to tell you how pissed off I am right now

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh man

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I really, you know, I have a whole bunch of mixed feelings

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
About some European countries

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Everyone here is just trying to smoke a lot

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Drink a lot and drive as fast as they can

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And that did not appeal to me

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Why?

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Because I'll never see any of that money

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Because homophobia

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I think we want to stay away from doing

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And hopefully it will work itself out

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
In the course of the next couple of days

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I may not be your cup of tea

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But I encourage you to listen to this song

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The shapes

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Hey, who are you guys?

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
How'd you get in here?

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Stepping away from the microphone

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Are those guns?

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You're going to floor now, Gwingo!

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Pig!

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Time up!

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Time up!

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Go on!

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Don't hurt me

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm fragile

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We are the podcast liberation front

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We have taken Adam Kreeh Hostage

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And if I check the daily source code

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
We will have Lucia

119
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
We will have Lucia

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
We will have Lucia

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Don't you not even shoot in your gun man

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You're just going to shoot, shoot, shoot

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And put your fingers in the air

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Well, really silent man

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I don't want to shoot

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But I got two strikes already man

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And I'm not going to go on in the car

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Then go get it man

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Oh, okay, but I need some quarters for the meter

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Dude, you're a real shitty revolutionary

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If you aren't married to my sister

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I never want to let you in the podcast liberation front

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Anyway, I thought we were the podcast liberation army man

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I couldn't get the domain name

135
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Always army, why can't we be the podcast liberation navy?

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Because we don't have any votes

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't mess

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I just shouldn't dump your ass

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Dude, dude quit fighting

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Don't you understand

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We have Mr. Adam Kreeh

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We can have whatever we want

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He's right

144
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Let's not fight man

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
All the manices

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
We have Mr. Adam Kreeh

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Right Mr. Adam Kreeh

148
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh, bro

149
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We need a Mr. Adam Kreeh

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What should we do with him?

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I need time to think

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Really commercial or something

153
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't know how to work this thing man

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't you get a button man

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What's the matter, Karen?

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I have a terrible sore throat

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Do you have any throat lasenges?

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Well, I have my balls

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
My balls?

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What's that?

161
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's a throat lasenges shaped like a lollipop

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Nothing will sue the or throat faster than my balls

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Wow, they sound great

164
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Do they last a long time?

165
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Absolutely

166
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
In fact, you can leave my balls in your mouth for hours at a time

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And that's smooth soothing feeling never goes away

168
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Wow, I can't wait to try them

169
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Here you go

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Now tell me

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The next time your throat hurts

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Lick or suck on my balls

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Now a new limited T-bag flavor

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000

Your free day of winery, man

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Free day of winery, man

185
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Free day of winery, man

186
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Free day of winery, man

187
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I don't know, man

188
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I think one of them is a badge wine scene

189
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The chick is more Canadian

190
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Uh, dude

191
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You know, badge is a dude

192
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
He's better at not knowing

193
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Hey, we still have a figure

194
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Now what to do with the Ita Curry

195
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Let's say we pass them around

196
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,800
Dude you're gay. You're gay. No you're gay. No you're gay. Dude. Dude. Dude. Look over there at Paco.

197
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:09,200
He's got Mr. Adam Curry. Oh my boy boy. Oh my boy. Oh Paco's gay, man. He's gay.

198
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,800
Dude. Go around the cottage and see if you can find Adam Curry Statue of Leopard Concord.

199
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:24,000
Hey, capitalist pun father pig. What's in the closet here, man? Oh Mr. Adam Curry doesn't seem to want us to look in there.

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Open it up, man. Holy shit, man. Oh damn.

201
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But those video tapes, man. What's on them? It says here, introducing everyone's head that's torn by poison.

202
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:46,000
May 1989. Next one says, introducing girl, knowledge true by Millie Vanilli, June 1989.

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I think these are all a Mr. Adam Curry's MTV shows. All of them? See, there must be 10,000 tapes in here.

204
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It is not healthy to obsess about your past Mr. Adam Curry.

205
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Maybe we should put on some MTV for Mr. Adam Curry to watch. I think he likes MTV.

206
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:13,000
There you go Mr. Adam Curry. Hey, who the hell is that? It looks like the crib keeper. He says it's current loader.

207
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
No way. He is dead, man. He died in 1997 at a Spice Girls Press John Kid.

208
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That's his desiccated quarks and amied with wires and shit. That's creepy, man.

209
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Look, you can see the strings if you look close enough.

210
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Shhh, turn that off. I think someone's here.

211

No, dude.

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
With Martha Quinn in 1992.

258
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
She wanted that ugly four-eye skin, Kennedy on MTV, Rob Downman.

259
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Dude, turn off your phone, man.

260
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
We're in the middle of a hijackie.

261
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Sorry, sorry.

262
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Hello?

263
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Michi Cabron.

264
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Mama.

265
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Busy.

266
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Mama.

267
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I can't talk right now.

268
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Okay, Mama.

269
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I gotta go.

270
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I gotta go, Mama.

271
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Oh, sorry.

272
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What did you do, man?

273
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I knocked over this statue here, man.

274
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What is that?

275
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
A really Martin figurine?

276
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I don't know.

277
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's just a bunch of hair, man.

278
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I think it's him.

279
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Mr. Adam Curry has a hairy little statue of himself.

280
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I think it was an award or something, man.

281
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Look, there's an inscription.

282
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Do our favorite big-haired fang.

283
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Love Pacific Coast Hillway.

284
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Oh, that's really sweet, man.

285
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Those guys are the best.

286
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh, yeah.

287
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I hear they give a lot of money to the poor and stuff.

288
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And this is the poor social causes.

289
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And they all have really big penises, man.

290
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Dude, how would you know that?

291
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Pacific Coast Hillway.com, man.

292
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
They got pictures and everything.

293
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Okay, first of all, that's not even true.

294
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Second, why would you look if it was true?

295
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It could be curious, man.

296
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Dude, the cops, we gotta get out of here.

297
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Michael, you gotta get off Mr. Adam Curry, man.

298
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
We gotta run.

299
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm stuck.

300
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm stuck.

301
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I need you to help me.

302
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'll do it.

303
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What do you mean, man?

304
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
He glanced off, man.

305
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Back to hurry.

306
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yeah.

307
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm starting Mr. Curry.

308
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
This is good.

309
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I heard you are.

310
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Then it hurts me.

311
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Run!

312
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Oh, just put some ice on him, man.

313
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
He'll move back.

314
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh, we got it.

315
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh, now!

316
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Leave a look at it with me.

317
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Oh, yeah, sir.

318
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And we're gonna do something different today.

319
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's been quite a, quite a crazy morning, actually.

320
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The bottom line is, right now, I'm gonna get it in the can.

321
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I believe it could be the other way around.

322
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I don't know what the proper name is.

323
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What was going to happen is I was going to be picked up by Roy,

324
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
and I think Nick was going to come along.

325
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
We're getting screwed.

326
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I was cool.

327
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Of course, I'm tethered.

328
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And then I'm going to have some lunch.

329
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh, man.

330
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Meanwhile, on the podcast, music thing is seen,

331
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
things are going very well.

332
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
We have a major, major artist sign up

333
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
and has dropped three songs onto the PMN.

334
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And one of those is titled Ever Since.

335
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm gonna play it right now.

336
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
This is Leslie Gore.

337
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I dreamt you.

338
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I drew you long before I thought that I might never find you.

339
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I chased you.

340
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I traced you and held your picture up into the light.

341
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
All the way to the night,

342
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
some day is too long to just cry.

343
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
All the parties I've been through,

344
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
you were missed.

345
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I waited ever since.

346
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I waited ever since.

347
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I met you.

348
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I tried to forget you.

349
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You know I felt somehow,

350
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
someone had sent you to me.

351
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And as if you knew me,

352
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
we picked up where we left off

353
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
in another life.

354
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
The times I tried to settle out

355
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
for so much less than this song.

356
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I waited ever since.

357
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I waited ever since.

358
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I waited ever since.

359
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
All the way to night,

360
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
some day is too long to just cry.

361
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
All the parties I've been through,

362
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
you were missed.

363
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I waited ever since.

364
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I waited ever since.

365
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I waited ever since.

366
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I met you.

367
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Oh my gosh.

368
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Matt's from Bristol says,

369
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Adam, I waited a hospital last week

370
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
for small operation, nothing too serious.

371
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Thank goodness.

372
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I think that that I was prepared for that

373
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and that I almost automatically

374
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
gravitated towards explaining

375
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
but I have the long-haired lover from Liverpool.

376
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Man, what a genius, genius talent.

377
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The funny thing was that in his email

378
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
he said, hey dude,

379
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
love it if you stick it up at turbine.

380
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Anyway,

381
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
the,

382
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
to,

383
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
to,

384
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and so I fired off an email.

385
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I said,

386
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
you know,

387
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
right now,

388
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
and then I'm going to,

389
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
anyway.

390
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
We got to go.

391
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
We got to get out of here.

392
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Those of you listening to a serious channel 102.

393
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
This is the daily source code part of the pod show line up.

394
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Up next,

395
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
we will have Pacific Coast Highway,

396
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
followed by yeast radio and Dawn and Drew.

397
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
We'll take you up until 10 o'clock eastern time,

398
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
7 Pacifica.

399
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And if anything,

400
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
it'll be fun to figure it out

401
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
if we can stir up some shit.

402
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Dig it.

403
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
All right.

404
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
One more song.

405
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Cool water's banned.

406
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Don't forget where you came from.

407
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm a little confused.

408
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
About all this enemy fire,

409
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
about drug laws and holy walls,

410
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
and people freaking out,

411
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
over what they want to freak about.

412
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Oh,

413
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
so tired.

414
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
There's nothing on my radio.

415
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Some little girl who laughs and sleep,

416
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
reloads and tries to sing,

417
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
how she wants to dance.

418
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And all of me,

419
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I sometimes wonder what they gave to me there.

420
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And don't forget where you came from.

421
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
No, I won't.

422
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Don't forget where you came from.

423
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And don't forget about all the people.

424
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You'll laugh into your head.

425
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And don't forget where you came from.

426
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And don't forget where you came from.

427
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And don't forget where you came from.

428
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And don't forget where you came from.

429
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And don't forget where you came from.

430
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And don't forget where you came from.

431
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And don't forget where you came from.

432
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And don't forget where you came from.

433
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And don't forget where you came from.

434
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And don't forget where you came from.

435
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And don't forget where you came from.

436
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And don't forget where you came from.

437
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And don't forget where you came from.

438
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And don't forget where you came from.

439
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And don't forget where you came from.

440
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And don't forget where you came from.

441
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And don't forget where you came from.

442
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And don't forget about all the people.

443
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You'll laugh into your head.

444
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:59,000
When I think my girl got a call to share her time, go by, got a little too husk.

445
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
You're blaming all I'm talking about, yeah, I'm just easier, a little easier.

446
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Slow down, so we're going to find a down, with a graph screen, you were so obscene.

447
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Maybe your sign didn't look like mine, but I'm fine.

448
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Yeah, I don't want it.

449
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
So I'll be where you came from, no, I won't.

450
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You'll be where you came from, no, I won't.

451
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You'll be where you came from, no, I won't.

452
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You'll be where you came from, no, I won't.

453
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You can't even change from no matter what you're gonna be when you're making it.

454
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:44,600
It's over here now that I'll be following you and I'll be into your path, into your head.

455
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Go Waters Band, don't forget what you came from, from the rose pedal to the metal CD.

456
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,120
You can find it all on the Podsafe Music Network at Podsafe MusicNetwork.com or

457
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,640
if you prefer music.podshow.com.

458
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,640
That's it for me and I'll see you back here tomorrow.

459
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,440
Bye-bye.
