1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,720
Good morning. Good afternoon or good evening. This is Trucker Two Times and I am

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:22,560
listening to the Daily Source Code number 480C.

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,840
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation radio

4
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:40,560
content in my ears. I like to think I'm flying into the future.

5
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:47,560
Like on Scoop is still to see our truly 486.

6
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:58,080
Well imagine as I'm facing the pews in a church called Resort and I can't help but to hear

7
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:05,360
I can't help but to hear in exchanging of words. What a beautiful wedding. What a beautiful

8
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,280
wedding. This is a bright day to a way out. But what a shame what a shame the poor

9
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:47,280
I think we are married to save for this call for our death.

10
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,280
Well look at it this way. I mean, technically our marriage is saved.

11
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,280
Well let's call for a toast. So for the champagne for the champagne.

12
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:09,280
I can't help but to hear in exchanging of words.

13
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,280
I can't help but to hear in exchanging of words.

14
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:27,280
I can't help but to hear in exchanging of words.

15
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,280
I can't help but to hear in exchanging of words.

16
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:51,280
I can't help but to hear in exchanging of words.

17
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,280
I can't help but to hear in exchanging of words.

18
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
I can't help but to hear in exchanging of words.

19
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
I can't help but to hear in exchanging of words.

20
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,280
I can't help but to hear in exchanging of words.

21
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,280
I can't help but to hear in exchanging of words.

22
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,280
I can't help but to hear in exchanging of words.

23
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,280
I can't help but to hear in exchanging of words.

24
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
I can't help but to hear in exchanging of words.

25
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:24,280
I can't help but to hear in exchanging of words.

26
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:37,280
I can't help but to hear in exchanging of words.

27
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:44,120
I write sins, not tragedies, panic at the disco, heard that song this morning on radio

28
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,920
one and thought, I got to play that and guess what I can because it's on the podcast

29
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,920
music network.

30
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

31
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
Football Friday.

32
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,920
We were fucked up beyond role repair, winding up the week coming to you from a curry

33
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,120
cottage later than usual.

34
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,320
I actually haven't been entirely true for you guys.

35
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,040
I posted on curry.com that had some stuff I needed to take care of.

36
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,920
Yesterday I was indeed in the city, so sorry, it's the blackberry after I moved that.

37
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,200
Yesterday I was indeed in the city, a whole bunch of meetings winding up with even a dinner

38
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,800
meetings, I didn't get home until around 11.30, half-11 as we say.

39
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,200
And I said that I had more stuff to do today.

40
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,640
Actually, I'm going to be working in the city over the weekend today with something different.

41
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,320
And I didn't want to tell you until after the fact, because I didn't want anyone really

42
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:42,000
to know that today I had concocted an evil plan with the win commander, win commander William

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,320
of course my flight instructor, who had finished a huge bunch of maintenance on my aircraft

44
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:56,040
the Delta Shira and it was an Antwerp which of course is across the pond there in Belgium.

45
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,840
He had done that while I was in the States in San Francisco and it was ready.

46
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,720
Now he was happy to fly it over of course, but that usually means that he has to be flown

47
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,560
back and then the aircraft has to come back again.

48
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,280
It's only about an hour each way, so it's actually fun to do that kind of back and forth

49
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,280
ferry.

50
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,440
Now, he's being a Friday, there's no way that Captain Dan could accompany me for the flight.

51
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,680
So William and I had decided that if the weather was nice, I would do my big channel crossing

52
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,400
solo.

53
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,120
And I did it.

54
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,800
So I got back around five o'clock, so right now it's like six, six, forty five.

55
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,680
And I'm still just totally buzzing.

56
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,560
I hadn't told Patricia because the last thing I wanted was her being worried all day.

57
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,400
I didn't figure it now, I'll tell her later.

58
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,880
And I was surprised that she hadn't figured out that something was up because she knew

59
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,800
William was coming over, she knew I was going to go flying, but I don't think she really

60
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
thought it through.

61
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,200
So how was William getting back?

62
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,760
So I flew him back, first we did a couple, I did a couple of solo landings over on the

63
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,840
continent, just to make sure I was comfortable with a different weight distribution being

64
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,840
by myself.

65
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,360
Oh, that aircraft is such a performer when I was just one person, man, that thing is fast.

66
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,640
And so I took off from Antwerp, went up to flight level five, five all the way past

67
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,880
Manson, went through a little bit of IMC, which means I was in the clouds for a little

68
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,880
bit climbing up to that flight level, which is essentially five and a half thousand feet.

69
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:33,320
And maybe about a minute or so in clouds on the way down, and it was very busy, it always

70
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,440
gets busy, particularly Friday afternoon, everybody's coming home, you get that corridor

71
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,400
from that link to Big and Hill, Farmboro, another big place where lots of private jets

72
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
go in.

73
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:51,640
And of course, then I turned into Farrogues, which is our little Biggles Airfield.

74
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
And everything was great.

75
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,520
And of course, the last two minutes are the most important because that's when you make

76
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,800
the most mistakes and really football, which I was not planning on doing.

77
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,720
There was kind of, everything was fantastic and I'm going downwind, ready to turn on

78
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,600
to base and then finals for my landing.

79
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,040
And yeah, some other guys like saying, oh, the aircraft turning five all these low is

80
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
very, very low.

81
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,600
I'm like, and you think about, and you hear that, and I knew we was talking about me.

82
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,200
And like, whoa, what am I doing something wrong?

83
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,080
I look, and I'm 900 feet, and so, and he just gaping through the radio.

84
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,960
And I just said, excuse me, I'm 900 feet, very comfortable.

85
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,880
And even the tower said, hey, aircraft is a perfect height, no worries.

86
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,760
It was just, you know, God, why do people do that?

87
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,160
It's a fucking stupid.

88
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,640
And he was like more like an accusatory tone than a warning tone.

89
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:48,680
Anyway, nice move landing, and then told Patricia, call everybody else.

90
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,120
So I'm still really, really buzzing.

91
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,640
This is a big deal for me, certainly, probably for any pilot, because there's a lot of unknowns.

92
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,440
It's, it's a lot of water, a lot of water you're flying over.

93
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,920
So anyway, still got tons of stuff to go through with you today.

94
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,120
I've done the preparation, but as I said, I'm still kind of literally with my head in the

95
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,120
sky.

96
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,160
So let's just discover together what I've got lined up for you here today.

97
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
Okay.

98
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,360
You were, and this is Donny and Donny from Jezzy.

99
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,040
You were, and I heard you were in New York, and you didn't stop by and say hi to the boys

100
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,040
in Jezzy.

101
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,040
Come on, you got a Jezzy number.

102
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
Yeah, Jezzy number.

103
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,480
I don't know what's up with that item, but I happy ADSC486 anyway.

104
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Well, he didn't say hi.

105
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
He didn't even call me.

106
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,480
I don't know what's going on.

107
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,480
I'm sorry, Mom.

108
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,480
I apologize.

109
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
I was sick.

110
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,480
I told you.

111
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,480
I told you.

112
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,480
I had the flu.

113
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,480
It was really horrible.

114
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,280
There's a whole bunch of people who are angry at me.

115
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,640
Oh, you were New York, it didn't call.

116
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,320
I was freaking out with the flu.

117
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,320
It was horrible.

118
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,200
I felt so shitty, and I'm just now finally kind of getting over it.

119
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,440
Of course, I didn't get a flu shot.

120
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,000
I told you Patricia got a flu shot.

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,240
She didn't get sick.

122
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,440
She did feel kind of a little funky for a few hours in her arm hurt a little bit.

123
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
But that was it.

124
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,480
Although a lot of people have sent me comments about getting flu shots.

125
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
Hey, Adam.

126
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
Long, long, long time listener.

127
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
First time caller.

128
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,840
This is Gary LePoint from Colin from Michigan in the United States.

129
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,360
You were just talking about the influenza, the flu shot, and mentioned that it's a different

130
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
batch over here.

131
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,960
I'm pretty sure it's a different batch, depending on where you're calling by location.

132
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,360
Also, which I've never really understood how to mix a different batch up for this section

133
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,360
of the U.S.

134
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,360
and a different batch up for a different, for another section of the U.S.

135
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,160
So, just because you mentioned that, made me think of it.

136
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,160
I've never called and I've had your number in my speed dial ready to go when I had

137
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,880
something to say.

138
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:45,880
Thanks.

139
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,960
Thanks for putting on a great show almost every day.

140
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,880
I mean, it's a great show all the time, but the show is only almost every other day.

141
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,880
And I'm a folder.

142
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,880
Thanks.

143
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
Bye.

144
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
I don't know.

145
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,880
I hate it when people say, like, almost every day.

146
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,880
You do great.

147
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Almost great.

148
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,880
You can't quite get a show at every day.

149
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
Yeah, crap.

150
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
Life gets in the way.

151
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
No, I'm saying.

152
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,880
Speaking of the voicemail number, standby to jot something down here.

153
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:27,880
I wonder.

154
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,880
Would that sound better with cowbell?

155
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:49,880
Sounds the same with it without.

156
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,880
60, a plus one, 201, 65, 65, 65, 7.

157
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,880
More about the flu shots.

158
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
Hey, yeah.

159
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
It's the way for model.

160
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,880
I'm just listening to 484 and you made the comment about not getting a flu shot.

161
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,880
I've got a flu shot for many years.

162
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,880
And yes, I'm trying to time I have felt happy.

163
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,880
But I haven't had the flu.

164
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,880
Now, as the report in the financial times about the people dying from the flu shot,

165
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:23,880
yeah, this was, was it a couple of folks in Israel, I believe, died after receiving

166
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,880
their flu shot like five, all from the same batch that's what this call is referring to.

167
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:34,880
Some people do die every year from flu shots and other shots and vaccinations because of egg allergies.

168
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,880
Usually these people don't know their allergic to eggs.

169
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:43,880
The other thing, and this is what drives me up the wall, is journalists will tend to

170
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,880
sensationalize stuff.

171
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,880
How many people in Israel died from influenza last year?

172
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
Think about that one.

173
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,880
Anyways, but I hope the good work.

174
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:01,880
And yes, folder and maybe a little bit of even when it comes to people and miscutes, statistics and signs.

175
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,880
Be cool, man.

176
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,880
Bye bye.

177
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,880
You think?

178
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
Maybe just a little anal?

179
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,880
Yeah.

180
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,880
Well, I don't think financial times is not reporting on it as some sensationalist party,

181
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,880
but it's worth noting they came from the same batch, so probably from the same manufacturer.

182
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,880
And that can usually mean a recall.

183
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,880
Man, if you see what's happened to fucking Sony, I mean,

184
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,880
we're calling 8 million batteries now.

185
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,880
I'm still waiting for them to recall the battery on my laptop and my bio, which has not been overheating,

186
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,880
has not burst into flames yet, but it's also not been put on the recall list.

187
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,880
But yeah, the thing about eggs, that is kind of interesting.

188
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:45,880
I didn't learn about about the egg part until, I think maybe six months ago or something,

189
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,880
all vaccinations.

190
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,880
And of course, this is in regards to the avian bird flu, which we don't hear a lot about.

191
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,880
Isn't it time to scare us without again?

192
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:05,880
All vaccinations, all vaccines, essentially, are created in eggs, which is why stuff can't be created very, very quickly.

193
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,880
It literally has to cultivate in eggs, which is, I think, 1950's technology,

194
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,880
and there's a lot of work and a lot of money going into trying to figure out how to cultivate

195
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,880
vaccines outside of eggs.

196
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,880
But I guess that would be why people then essentially die if they're allergic to eggs.

197
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,880
That sucks if you're allergic to eggs.

198
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,880
Cranky.

199
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Let me see.

200
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Oh, yes, little promo.

201
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880

Very professional.

213
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,880
I'm looking for a...

214
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,880
This is a problem when you're in the city one day, and you're crossing the English channel the next.

215
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,880
You don't get around to the email.

216
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,880
I think I have two Gmail pages, so that's about 200 emails.

217
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,880
I quickly just scan through and see if there's anything I wanted to put in the show.

218
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
I really need to get it out, obviously.

219
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,880
This is something that really, really tickled me when it came in.

220
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,880
This came in yesterday morning.

221
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,880
Hi Adam.

222
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
I'm not going to say who...

223
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
I'll skip one.

224
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
Hi Adam.

225
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,880
I just wanted to say thanks for playing building our own future on your podcast show.

226
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
And big in me up.

227
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
Thanks for the help with the tour dates as well.

228
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,880
If I can be of assistance, best wishes.

229
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,880
Howard.

230
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
That would be Howard Jones.

231
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
I thought that was so awesome.

232
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,880
Because of course, how are Jones?

233
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,880
I know him from the early 80s.

234
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,880
I've played so many of his songs on the radio.

235
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
I've played so many of his videos.

236
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,880
I know.

237
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,880
Actually, people under a certain age don't know who Howard Jones is.

238
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,880
And they've played the song form, which of course is in the pod state music network.

239
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,880
And go, that's pretty cool.

240
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,880
And some of them say, oh yeah, I think, oh, oh yeah, that's the one.

241
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
That's the guy.

242
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,880
So not only is it just fantastic that he sent that note,

243
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,880
but then there's a PS to it.

244
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,880
PS, he says, I'm a folder.

245
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,880
I never thought about Howard, but make sense.

246
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,880
Here's building our own future.

247
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,880
Time for us to sneak down and talk.

248
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,880
Try to build on your understanding.

249
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,880
What we feel is we all today.

250
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,880
The moment we talk to each other.

251
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,880
Between the light and the dark side.

252
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,880
So take a step in this place.

253
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Got a real building our own future.

254
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,880
Just for now.

255
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,880
Day by day, free to choose a life.

256
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,880
It's better for all of us.

257
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:57,880
Putting people's lives at the top.

258
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,880
There's the first consideration.

259
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,880
Changing in the heart of just one of the world of things.

260
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,880
Time makes us.

261
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,880
Don't give it up.

262
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:26,880
To the face of the force around us, we decide.

263
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,880
Between the end and the outside.

264
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,880
So take a step in this place.

265
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Got a real building our own future.

266
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
Just for now.

267
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Day by day, free to choose a life.

268
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,880
It's better for all of us.

269
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,880
Sons and colors.

270
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,880
When there's a father's words,

271
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
When there's a brother's words,

272
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
When there's a brother's words,

273
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
When there's a brother's words,

274
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,880
When there's a brother's words,

275
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
When there's a brother's words,

276
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,880
When there's a brother's words,

277
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,880
When there's a brother's words,

278
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,880
When there's a brother's words,

279
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
When there's a brother's words,

280
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,880
When there's a brother's words,

281
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,880
When there's a brother's words,

282
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,880
When there's a brother's words,

283
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,880
When there's a brother's words,

284
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,880
When there's a brother's words,

285
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,880
When there's a brother's words,

286
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
When there's a brother's words,

287
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,880
When there's a brother's words,

288
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,880
When there's a father's words,

289
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
When there's a brother's words,

290
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,880
When there's a brother's words,

291
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,880
If there's a brother's words,

292
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:47,880
So take a stand in this place

293
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,880
God will build in our own future

294
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,880
Just when I want to take my day

295
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,880
Free to choose a life

296
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:16,880
This is a musical genius

297
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,880
I gotta say

298
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,880
First, it's a folder

299
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,880
Our Jones building our own future

300
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,880
He's on tour, tour dates will be

301
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,880
You can find those in the show notes

302
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
DailySourceCode.com

303
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,880
Or even on his own page

304
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,880
The pod set music network

305
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,880
Which of course you can find a link to in the show notes

306
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,880
I don't know how much of the production

307
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,880
How it does himself

308
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
But oh man, that snare is just

309
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
BAM!

310
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
It just slaps away so hard

311
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
I love it

312
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
Love it

313
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,880
I was just thinking

314
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,880
Defolders and scrunchers

315
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Prefer in macar windows

316
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880
I don't know if you're a folder

317
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,880
And you've been a dick neck

318
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,880
For most of your computer use

319
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,880
Until recently

320
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
But I'm a folder

321
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
And I'm a mac guy

322
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,880
So everything about that

323
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,880
Everyone

324
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,880
Very interesting

325
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,880
Is it?

326
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,880
Is there a correlation between being a folder and a mac user?

327
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,880
Hmm, let me think about that

328
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,880
People talk about it baby

329
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,880
Sam doing it wrong, doing it wrong

330
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,880
Don't you ever blame it, don't worry

331
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,880
Because I'm a white and white

332
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,880
And white and white in my bone

333
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
Come on, sing along now

334
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
Because I'm a folder

335
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
I'm a scruncher

336
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
I'm a roller

337
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,880
And I'm a buncher

338
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,880
But do my business on the throne

339
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,880
I'm a sitter

340
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,880
I'm a spanner

341
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,880
I'm a left-right hander

342
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,880
It's nice to know

343
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,880
I'm not alone

344
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
I don't know man

345
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,880
I don't think so

346
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,880
Because that would mean

347
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
There's only 5% of the population

348
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Is a folder

349
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
And I think it's much much higher than that

350
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
But

351
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
You know, and I'm a windows guy now

352
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,880
Still a folder

353
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,880
But I think it's a very, very, very valid question

354
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,880
I'm sure everyone will be happy to tell me all about it

355
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,880
If you're a mac user, do you follow the scratch?

356
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,880
Hey Adam, I was just driving, my parents are driving

357
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
And I'm in the back seat

358
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
Listening to the daily source code

359
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,880
Listening to your tea town to stuff

360
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,880
It was really interesting

361
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,880
Right next to me there was this little pool

362
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,880
The dog freaked out

363
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,880
I guess he was hearing the tones out of my iPod

364
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,880
Maybe I was listening to a little loud

365
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,880
But that was cool

366
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,880
The dog was freaking out

367
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,880
And then when I turned off the

368
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,880
Turned off the door

369
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880
The dog just calmed down

370
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
And this was a car across the way

371
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,880
All right, thank you

372
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,880
And a folder of course

373
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,880
Keep up the good work

374
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,880
Thanks, bye

375
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,880
Dude, dude

376
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,880
This is really interesting

377
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,880
Okay

378
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,880
Whatever you're listening to the show now

379
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,880
You're in your MP3 player, your computer or your iPod

380
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
Yeah, iPod, I guess

381
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Right, because even I have

382
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
You had your headphones, your earbuds

383
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,880
Okay, go get your dog

384
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,880
Man, go get your dog

385
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,880
What I want you to do is get something to record with

386
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,880
Okay

387
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,880
Do you have anything to record with

388
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,880
Like a recorder?

389
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
Otherwise just call in the voicemail number

390
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,880
Okay, we'll use that as the recording

391
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,880
I'll give you a second

392
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,880
Cause I know you already have a pre-program

393
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,880
So I want you to call up

394
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,880
Now get your dog

395
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,880
Okay, get your dog close

396
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,880
Let's see if it actually is true

397
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,880
If the dog really is responding to

398
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,880
To Pete Townsend

399
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,880
Okay, hold on a second

400
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,880
Now turn it up to about the same volume you had

401
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,880
With the flaming lips and his tongue

402
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,880
And let's, and I want you to record the dog's reaction

403
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
Okay, here we go

404
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,880
I'll just play a little bit of Bob O'Reilly

405
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,880
Pete Townsend the flaming lips

406
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,880
Live

407
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,880
And in acoustic concert

408
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,880
Here we go

409
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,880
Okay, I want to hear this dog yalllan

410
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,880
Oh

411
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,880
Is he responding yet?

412
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,880
Well, is he responding?

413
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
Come here fight up

414
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,880
Come here

415
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,880
Excellent

416
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,880
We'll see that turns out

417
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,880
Okay, I don't know if he's calling from Bucket

418
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,880
He's calling, I heard you can't find one down

419
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,880
There in the, in Britain

420
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
All right, let's watch that

421
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,880
We found that our spondon

422
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,880
There's cut you neatly amongst the coffee creamer

423
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,880
You would spend, I see it near the sugar

424
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,880
The sugar set the juice

425
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
But because I'm a new flavor pack

426
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,880
Actually cut in between the creamers

427
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,880
Where I'm a coffee

428
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
So they can have my job on it

429
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,880
I pick up some two to that spondomooker

430
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
It's tough

431
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,880
Bye

432
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,880
Okay, time to get serious on your ass

433
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,880
Of course

434
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,880
It's actually, I think it's not too serious

435
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,880
It's kind of cool for a food bar

436
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,880
I

437
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,880
I received a comment from bicycle mark

438
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,880
And bicycle mark was talking about

439
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
Citizen Journalism

440
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,880
And I gave out

441
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
I think was Wednesday's show

442
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,880
And I basically talked about my

443
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,880
My opinion, my thoughts about Citizen Journalism

444
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,880
And what it entails and what it means

445
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,880
And what it entails and what it means

446
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,880
And what it's for

447
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,880
And if it's functional, if it actually works

448
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,880
If it does anything for us

449
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,880
And

450
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,880
I got lots of feedback

451
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,880
I haven't even gone to the voicemail for today

452
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,880
And I'm sure there's a ton more

453
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,880
So I think this will probably be going for a day or two

454
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,880
Let me just quickly restate my opinion

455
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,880
Now the, the concept of Citizen Journalism

456
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,880
It's okay

457
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,880
You know, I've no problem with that

458
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,880
What I said was it's like sounding off

459
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,880
And it is sounding off

460
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,880
It's giving your opinion

461
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,880
Sometimes it's exposing

462
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,880
Or it's shining a different light

463
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,880
On an issue

464
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,880
And it's usually related to politics in the world around us

465
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,880
Or the world around you

466
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,880
You Citizen Journalists

467
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,880
Which is all fine

468
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,880
And certainly a great contrast

469
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,880
For what the mainstream media

470
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
Is either able or capable

471
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,880
Or willing to show us feed us, etc

472
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,880
And there's all kinds of manipulation and stupid stuff

473
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,880
Going on in mainstream media

474
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,880
And there's a lot of manipulation and stupid stuff

475
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,880
Going on in Citizen Journalism

476
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,880
I don't take anything

477
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,880
More than face value initially

478
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,880
But my entire point was

479
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,880
I want us to get ready to move on

480
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,880
We're great at

481
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,880
At the being voices of opposition

482
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,880
Voices of truth

483
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,880
Co-Truth

484
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,880
Voices with a different type of flashlight

485
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,880
So it's shining on the issue in a different way

486
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,880
I think we're really good

487
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,880
Bicycle Mark is great at it

488
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,880
What I'm looking for is people who are going to go do something

489
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,880
Do something and then use our alternative media

490
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,880
To get there

491
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,880
Very much like mainstream media

492
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,880
Uses advertising to a like presidents

493
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,880
Can't we get someone to use this platform

494
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880
To get into office

495
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,880
But really use it

496
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,880
Not have some guys set it up

497
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,880
But it being an integral part of their leadership platform

498
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,880
Let me first play you bicycle marks re-tort

499
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,880
Not really re-tort

500
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,880
But his response to what I was talking about on Wednesday

501
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,880
Hi Adam

502
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,880
Bicycle Mark here again

503
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,880
Just wanted to continue the discussion

504
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,880
That you sort of began or that we began

505
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,880
On the issue of people

506
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,880
Regular people

507
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,880
Using podcasts to do what I call citizen journalism

508
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,880
And you perhaps rightfully criticize the name

509
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
It is subject to criticism

510
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,880
But I wanted to continue the discussion and say

511
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,880
In many ways I think podcasting is a perfect venue

512
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,880
To make alternatives to the media

513
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,880
You called it sounding off

514
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,880
In fact, you're somewhat right

515
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
It is a lot of sounding off

516
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,880
But the beauty of this as you've so often have said

517
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,880
When it comes to music and other art and areas

518
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,880
The beauty is that we don't have to just take the mainstream

519
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,880
What they give to us, be it the New York Times

520
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,880
Or CNN

521
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,880
Granted, they have a staff and they have some standards

522
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,880
Although those standards are very questionable

523
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,880
As we've seen them reduced in the last few years

524
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,880
To a very low in some cases

525
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,880
The beauty of podcasts as you well know

526
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,880
Much like blogs is that we can do our own reporting

527
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,880
From where we are, with what we know

528
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,880
Or using all the resources available to us

529
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,880
Resources like people in our lives

530
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
Or that we meet whatever

531
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,880
And in that sense, we can provide a news report

532
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,880
Yes, that report could have opinion in it

533
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,880
And we make no secrets of it

534
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,880
I think in podcasting we've always been honest

535
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
As you have

536
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,880
So we'd make no secret of our bias or our opinion

537
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,880
But the job is for the listener

538
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,880
Just like with weblogs

539
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,880
The listener, the reader, or the viewer for a video blog

540
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,880
Has to go and decide for themselves

541
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,880
And hopefully consult multiple sources

542
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,880
That's the way this works, right?

543
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,880
In some ways I know that you know what I'm talking about

544
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,880
But I wanted to bring this up, I wanted to continue this discussion

545
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,880
Because I think it's a very important area

546
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,880
When it comes to society and podcasts and media

547
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,880
I think there is a role and it's growing

548
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,880
But very slowly and yes, we're completely drowned out

549
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,880
By the mainstream podcasts that provide some good

550
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,880
But although also some questionable reporting

551
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,880
So I'd like to hear your response to this

552
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,880
And I'm certainly up for anyone else's opinion

553
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,880
In this whole discussion

554
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,880
But citizen journalism or podcast journalism

555
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,880
Like radio journalism only in a new way in a different style

556
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
I think it really does have a place

557
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,880
I hope so I've been working on it for quite a while now

558
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,880
See you later

559
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,880
So of course it has a place

560
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,880
And of course it's opinionated

561
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,880
And of course it's going to be right and wrong

562
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,880
Just like anyone else who's reporting

563
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,880
Guess what I'm saying is

564
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,880
I'd just like to see a leader actually use

565
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,880
Use the media, the mediums

566
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,880
That we have shown the way

567
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,880
Showing the light on how this can be used

568
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,880
For all types of ideas and platforms

569
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,880
And movements

570
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,880
I'd just like to see one leader once

571
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,880
Just really use the technology

572
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,880
A couple of them maybe blogging

573
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,880
It's like I've got a lot of email from people saying

574
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,880
What's his name?

575
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,880
Well I'm totally blanking on it

576
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,880
Barack Obama, is that it?

577
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,880
Barack?

578
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,880
He's got a podcast

579
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
Oh cool

580
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,880
I'm starting to really like this guy

581
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,880
Hi, this is the podcast for May 4th

582
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,880
See that's exactly what I mean

583
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,880
It's just a not dedicated to it

584
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,880
And it doesn't just have to be politics

585
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,880
Here's an example of what I mean

586
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,880
I'm going to give you an actual example

587
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,880
Of the type of citizen journalism

588
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,880
I don't want to call it citizen journalism

589
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,880
Of a use of podcasting

590
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,880
That is someone doing something

591
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,880
And getting something done

592
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,880
And podcasting it and letting everyone else know about it

593
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,880
Which I think is much more powerful than just saying

594
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,880
Hey, it's fucked up and swars you land

595
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,880
Boy, it's no good

596
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,880
People are dying

597
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,880
Now this is the kind of stuff you want

598
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,880
Adam, how you make it?

599
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,880
It's Paul Nichols in podcast pool.com

600
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,880
Listen to your show where you talk about

601
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,880
Citizen journalism

602
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,880
And I think you said

603
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,880
Why do people really do stuff with this?

604
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
You know make a difference

605
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,880
Well I accept

606
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,880
Probably a lot of people don't make a difference

607
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,880
But some do

608
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,880
And just by way of a quick demonstration

609
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,880
Really I suppose

610
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,880
I'm flying to Swaziland next week

611
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
To go to the AIDS orphanage

612
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,880
I did that last year

613
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,880
Took the laptop

614
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,880
And the many of this player

615
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
Everything

616
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,880
Thought it'd just be a great thing to talk about

617
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,880
But it suddenly dawned on me

618
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,880
When I was there

619
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,880
The plight of these poor kids

620
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,880
Have lost the mums and dads

621
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,880
And literally are dying on the streets

622
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,880
Talking into the microphone

623
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,880
Literally sat in a mud house

624
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,880
The most bizarre sort of experience

625
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,880
Gosh it

626
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
Just moves me to tears

627
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,880
Thinking about it

628
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
Blimey

629
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,880
But for that

630
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,880
But for sort of talking about that

631
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,880
People wouldn't have heard

632
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,880
About the plight of these poor kids

633
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
In Maban

634
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,880
And I just wonder you know

635
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,880
People are doing this

636
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,880
Probably up and down the place

637
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,880
It's just that that small pockets

638
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,880
And people don't really hear about it

639
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,880
But gosh it was so well received

640
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,880
The BBC broadcast that

641
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,880
We raised some money

642
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
In fact

643
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
We raised some money

644
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,880
And built a children's home

645
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
On the back

646
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,880
On the back of going out

647
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,880
They're not necessarily with the podcast

648
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
But folks helped

649
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,880
And just very quickly

650
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,880
Podcast conference this year

651
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,880
John Buckley

652
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,880
Who

653
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,880
There's a great podcast

654
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,880
called Disident Thoughts

655
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,880
Great podcast

656
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,880
Very intelligent guy

657
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,880
Talks back in spurious theories

658
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,880
But in a very sensible way

659
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,880
Very thought provoking

660
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,880
He's leading the discussion

661
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,880
So charmers there from the open rights group

662
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,880
Chris Philanx from BBC

663
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,880
And they'll makin' tough from the Guardian

664
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,880
So you'll get your chance to listen to

665
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,880
What sits in journalism is all about

666
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,880
But if you tune into my show next week

667
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,880
PodcastPull.com

668
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,880
You'll really see this in action

669
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,880
Okay mate

670
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,880
All the best

671
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,880
See you

672
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,880
Bye bye now

673
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
Yo mate, thank you

674
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
Fantastic

675
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
See this is exactly what I'm talking about

676
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,880
He's not just sitting in home

677
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,880
Saying oh it's really horrible

678
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,880
These orphans

679
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,880
He went there

680
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,880
Okay

681
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,880
He actually went there

682
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,880
And used the medium

683
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,880
While he was involved in it

684
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,880
He was in the middle of it

685
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,880
By the way

686
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,880
I do this much of that as every other person

687
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,880
I read something in the news

688
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,880
And I sound off about it

689
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,880
You know

690
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,880
And that to me is really a form of citizen journalism

691
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,880
Now

692
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,880
When

693
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,880
Oh when it comes to podcasting

694
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,880
I'm really using the platform

695
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,880
And I practice what I preach

696
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,880
You know

697
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
I do what I say

698
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,880
And I mean what I say

699
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,880
I say what I do

700
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,880
I do what I mean to say

701
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,880
I really do it

702
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,880
I mean the middle of it

703
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,880
And that is when it becomes in my mind

704
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,880
Much more compelling

705
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,880
Like a Corey Lidal

706
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,880
La

707
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,880
Sounding off about that

708
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,880
La

709
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,880
Of citizen journalism

710
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,880
And even I wasn't

711
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,880
Right

712
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,880
And at least not the first time

713
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,880
But what I think what I found was

714
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,880
That as I started listening to other

715
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,880
podcast aviation podcasts

716
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,880
I was finally able to hone in

717
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,880
And what it was all about

718
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,880
And I was able to aggregate that

719
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,880
And I was able to contribute to my knowledge

720
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
The conversation

721
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
Really in the middle of it

722
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
So I'm going on

723
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,880
So if you're in politics

724
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,880
I want the same thing

725
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,880
And if you're going to

726
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
And I really think that that is

727
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,880
That's a big issue in the United States of America

728
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,880
Is everyone is happy to sound off about it

729
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,880
From the cab driver to the podcast

730
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
Or

731
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,880
But do something

732
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,880
Run

733
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
Run

734
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,880
Run

735
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,880
Why not

736
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,880
That's really important

737
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,880
I will definitely

738
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,880
Anyone who's going to run

739
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
Seriously for office

740
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
I don't give a shit

741
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
What party?

742
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
What ticket?

743
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,880
Anything to promote the shit out of you

744
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
If you're right in the middle of it

745
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,880
And if you're

746
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,880
If you're really using the

747
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,880
The medium that we have

748
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,880
To get the message out

749
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,880
It'll work

750
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,880
I know it will work

751
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,880
There's a I got another like

752
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,880
Three and a half minute comment

753
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,880
I'm going to save that until next week

754
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,880
It was pretty funny though

755
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,880
Here I'll let you hear the beginning

756
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,880
I had him this is Jeffrey the gay expat

757
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
From the gay expat

758
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
I got to play that one

759
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
Jeffrey the gay expat

760
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,880
Jeffrey

761
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,880
Well

762
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,880
I won't do that

763
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,880
On Monday

764
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,880
Because what am I?

765
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,880
What am I at now?

766
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,880
Thirty-five minutes?

767
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,880
Yeah and I still have

768
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,880
Oh shoot

769
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,880
Oh second

770
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,880
How could I have not done that?

771
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,880
I didn't even queue up

772
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,880
The official musicologist

773
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,880
That is of course

774
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,880
Very bad

775
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,880
Almost

776
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
I can't here we go

777
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,880
Okay it's ready to go

778
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,880
But first

779
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,880
This

780
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,880
Oh Adam

781
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,880
This is also

782
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
But I

783
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,880
In some of California

784
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,880
I have a Young Spursus

785
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,880
Ah

786
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,880
Well since you have that

787
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,880
Now we're from our spine here

788
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,880
It's the Yanks

789
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,880
This is the Brits

790
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,880
We'll drive each other crazy

791
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
But everybody knows that

792
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,880
It's apparent to see

793
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,880
That just like you and me

794
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,880
It's the Yanks

795
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,880
And the Brits

796
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,880
The Yanks

797
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
Versus the Brits

798
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,880
Mind the gag

799
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,880
I'm for you

800
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,880
I've been watching a lot of content

801
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
On the Discovery Channel recently

802
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,880
And they have a lot of segments

803
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,880
That were originally BVC segments

804
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,880
So they are your broadcasts

805
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,880
Think that you're in the state

806
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,880
And I've noticed that the announcer

807
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,880
The narrator of these pieces

808
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,880
Very often

809
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,880
Uses a multiplier

810
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,880
To indicate less fat

811
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,880
For example

812
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,880
There's a show about Australia

813
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,880
They said Australia has

814
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,880
30 times less population

815
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,880
In England

816
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,880
And they do it regularly

817
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,880
And it must be a British isp

818
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,880
Because it sounds completely flat

819
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,880
To my ears

820
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,880
I would say for example

821
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,880
Australia has one 30

822
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,880
The population of England

823
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,880
I would only use a multiplier

824
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,880
When it's more

825
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
Like I would say

826
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,880
That you know a hammer

827
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,880
Cost 3 times as much as a Toyota

828
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,880
Or something like that

829
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
So

830
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,880
I'd be interested to hear your observations on that

831
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,880
And those are the listeners

832
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,880
To the Chacha

833
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,880
And you can also catch my podcast

834
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,880
www.selfoc.com

835
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,880
The people places of handsome politics

836
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,880
Of South Orange County California

837
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,880
Take care

838
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,880
Okay

839
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,880
Hey, that sounds pretty interesting

840
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,880
I'll check out your podcast

841
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,880
You may be one of those people

842
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,880
Who's not just a citizen journalist

843
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,880
But actually doing something

844
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,880
Very interesting observation

845
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
Totally agree with it

846
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,880
And it really caught my ear

847
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,880
When I heard you talk about that

848
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,880
That does seem to be something

849
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,880
Very distinct distinct different

850
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
In our language

851
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,880
With the Brits Will indeed say

852
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,880
30 times less

853
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,880
Whereas I think your times always

854
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,880
Seems like the outcome should be more

855
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,880
It's interesting

856
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,880
And there's probably a couple more

857
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,880
Like that

858
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,880
By the way, someone actually said

859
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
Yesterday, oh

860
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,880
I heard you kind of slip into

861
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,880
An English accent there

862
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,880
When I said

863
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,880
Actually

864
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
Actually

865
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,880
Does that sound British?

866
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,880
Actually

867
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,880
Actually

868
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,880
You can try this cowbell out

869
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,880
Let's all give a night

870
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,880
To the hardest work

871
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,880
And lawyer

872
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,880
He's trying to tie

873
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,880
And then he's jersey tied

874
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,880
Yo

875
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,880
What's up, AC?

876
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,880
It's jersey tied

877
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,880
The official musicologist of the Chacha

878
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,880
Hey, and listen kids

879
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,880
The only way to be a musicologist

880
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,880
Is to check out the positive music network

881
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,880
Every day

882
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,880
And well, you know I'm a freak for it

883
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,880
And you know, every once in a while

884
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,880
When my boss is talking to me

885
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,880
Or a client, you're happy

886
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,880
Appyapyapyap in a way

887
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,880
I go over to the PMN

888
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,880
And check out what's going on

889
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,880
And I got to tell you

890
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,880
This has been some week

891
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,880
At the positive music network

892
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,880
I'm telling you

893
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,880
There are bands popping up

894
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,880
All the time that blow me away

895
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,880
And the one that stuck out to me

896
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
The most this week

897
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,880
Was Bill Vavino

898
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,880
And Bill Vavino

899
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,880
And his band is from Jersey

900
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,880
Of course

901
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,880
I mean, come on

902
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,880
I ain't Chacago tied

903
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,880
I'm Jersey tied baby

904
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,880
And the song that he put up

905
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,880
They're just absolutely blew me away

906
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,880
The song has changed your mind

907
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
I think you're going to enjoy it too

908
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,880
Happy footballer Friday

909
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
Everybody check this out

910
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,880
You're the one I'm dreaming of

911
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,880
And it gets too hot to wake up

912
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,880
But you know

913
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,880
All I want is you

914
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,880
Every time I get a phone

915
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,880
Upon the floor

916
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,880
I'm staying in trial

917
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,880
Since I trust him

918
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,880
Into the night

919
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,880
And you lock it deep inside

920
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,880
But this is a passion for burning deep

921
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,880
I just can't hide

922
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,880
But you know

923
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,880
Your face all is only

924
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,880
Do you think that this won't get somewhere

925
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,880
Will you remember that love

926
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,880
This would be a

927
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,880
Do you see our songs

928
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,880
Together deep within your heart

929
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,880
But you're a scary boy

930
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:38,880
And you can see the other side

931
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,880
Don't want to understand

932
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:49,880
If I could make you change your mind

933
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting in

934
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,880
Don't want to walk away again

935
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,880
Don't you keep saying that a love once never true

936
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,880
Can I share a part of you

937
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,880
But there is nothing you can do

938
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,880
But you know

939
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,880
All I want is you

940
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,880
But you lock this deep inside

941
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,880
Can't wait like this won't get somewhere

942
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,880
Will I remember that

943
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,880
Do you think that this won't get somewhere

944
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,880
Will you remember that love once never true

945
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,880
Can I share a part of you

946
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,880
But you know

947
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,880
Your face all is only

948
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,880
Do you think that a love once never true

949
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,880
Can I share a part of you

950
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,880
But there is nothing you can do

951
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,880
But you know

952
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,880
Your voice all is only

953
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,880
Do you think that a love once never true

954
00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:00,880
Don't change your mind, don't want to be afraid of getting it

955
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,880
I know it is your music

956
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,880
Don't change your mind when you're on your own

957
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,880
But I can't find it's your own thing I will

958
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:22,880
Take it slow, so please don't go

959
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:30,880
Keep your distance and push back to my feet

960
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:37,880
I'll take it slow, so please don't go

961
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,880
Keep your distance and push back to my feet

962
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,880
You are the same, be on the side

963
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,880
I want you to understand

964
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,880
If I can't you change your mind

965
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

966
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:06,880
If you can't see me on the side

967
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,880
Don't want to be on the side

968
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,880
If I can't hold you in one more time

969
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

970
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:25,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

971
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,880
Yeah

972
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,880
Of course it's from Jersey

973
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,880
Change your mind, don't want to be afraid of getting it

974
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,880
Change your mind, don't want to be afraid of getting it

975
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

976
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

977
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

978
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

979
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

980
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

981
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

982
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

983
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

984
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

985
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

986
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

987
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

988
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

989
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

990
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

991
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

992
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

993
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

994
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

995
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

996
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

997
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,880
Don't want to be afraid of getting it

998
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:42,280
that with that, but they, of course, are the ones that are extremely successful

999
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,760
of doing it. Now, there's a big difference between what we're doing at the

1000
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:53,080
Podjo network, and we're a new media company, probably one of the biggest

1001
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:57,640
new media companies, the type of media and advertising that we're doing. So let me

1002
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:03,440
just explain Google tracks relevance, so they'll look at a web page or yeah, I'm

1003
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:09,680
sure that they can skim or scan through a podcast, transcribe the words, and

1004
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:15,280
then insert an ad into that or the front of the back or whatever, and therefore

1005
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,320
provide relevance. And that'll be worth something, and they'll do it on a cost

1006
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:25,200
per thousand basis, a CPM, and that is a very, very lucrative, very successful

1007
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,680
business. However, the business that everybody is after, the Podjo is

1008
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,640
successfully embedded itself into is so-called brand advertising,

1009
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,320
loyalty-based advertising. It's a really big deal.

1010
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:42,640
You know, we already had a commercial in this show. Now, it's no secret splendid

1011
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,800
sponsoring the Daily Source Code and a number of other podcasts on the network,

1012
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,240
and you know, what's great about it is I don't have to do anything, you know,

1013
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,920
I just talk about the product, I tell you that they're a sponsor, and here's some

1014
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,200
ways we could have fun with it. In other words, turning the advertising into content,

1015
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,840
and I have just tons of people talking about splendor. You know, the Gilmore gang

1016
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:06,320
was like eight minutes of splendor. This is fantastic. This is the type of loyalty

1017
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:10,720
that advertisers are really looking for, big brand advertisers, which is why you see us

1018
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,320
with big brands, accurate. You know, Johnson and Johnson brands,

1019
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,400
splendor is a Johnson and Johnson brand. This is big, big stuff.

1020
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,960
And so just in basic form, I just want to say here's the difference,

1021
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,880
where Google tracks relevance and then places advertising relevant to that,

1022
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,960
pod show and the programming associated with a network, create relevance.

1023
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:41,040
We treat every single show or podcast, whatever you want to call it as a media property.

1024
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,720
Something needs to be marketed. Packages, the audience should be grown.

1025
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,120
No, make no mistake. We've always said, I've been very clear. We're all about the commercial

1026
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:55,760
aspect of it. And that bond between a producer or host, or which, of course, is often,

1027
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,080
you know, the producer is the host, is the runner, is the writer, is the technician.

1028
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:08,960
That bond between that producer and that audience is worth so much more than a cost per thousand

1029
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:16,240
basis. We don't even sell on that. Now, is it all that? No. Some of it, of course, is also a blanket

1030
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:22,560
sweep of 10 to 22nd promotional messages, like the Go Daddy stuff. You know, listening to this podcast,

1031
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:27,200
you'll hear information about how to get a great domain name at a killer price. And so,

1032
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,000
you know, I'll say, by the way, that's, you know, for 695, you want to get your domain name for a year,

1033
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,320
use checkout code DSC3, boom advertising. You know, like people are doing that,

1034
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:42,240
you know, many people registered domain names who've heard this on, on a pod show pod cast,

1035
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:48,160
it's outrageous. They're about to up the renew their deal with us. And for the UK as well,

1036
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,800
going to a special promotion for the UK, I hope I didn't blow anything by telling you. So I just,

1037
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:59,520
I just wanted to say that. It's, um, it's a, is a very big difference. And fantastic, the Google is

1038
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,080
going to be doing that. That's great. There's, you know, there's a lot of room for it. We don't focus

1039
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:08,640
on that. Almost do not focus on that at all. In fact, our insertion technology, we really use

1040
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,960
for golden tickets, which we'll be coming out with. Actually, there was one on, um,

1041
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:21,040
uh, what was a Jennifer show? The Guild of Fork? Was that it? Uh, she's going to kill me.

1042
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,800
I want a second. I don't want to get killed by Jennifer. I want to make sure, uh,

1043
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:36,160
am I stupid? Uh, wait. I'm in Gmail. As you can tell, trying to find it, uh, crap.

1044
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:43,440
Well, anyway, they did a, uh, was it a, a Folgers golden ticket giveaway?

1045
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:51,280
And here it is. Uh, and the Guild of Fork, a food philosophy. Ah, I'm sorry.

1046
00:48:53,120 --> 00:49:00,560
Slat me. Slat me with a wet towel. Um, you know, so that's another way we incorporate insertion

1047
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:05,760
technology, but do it in a whole different fashion. Uh, and that golden ticket stuff is so much fun.

1048
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:09,520
We kind of do another fucking golden ticket on the daily source code. All right, everybody.

1049
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,480
Time to wrap it up. Yes, you know, I day.

1050
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,120
Well, uh, of course with all this talk of citizen journalism, I could easily talk about

1051
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:29,120
citizen journalism. I have some kind of political statement to make, but I'd like to say something

1052
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:35,440
else. Today, I did something that really pushed my own limits, uh, something I'd never done before.

1053
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,840
Yeah, it's a rich boy's game, you know, flying across the English channel. I get all that, but

1054
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:46,480
it was a definite, I've really moved some barriers, um, to push myself to do that. And let me

1055
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:52,400
tell you, and I am reliably informed about, uh, drugs. There's nothing that beats that high.

1056
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,840
The high of pushing yourself further than you've ever been, whether that's in your relationship,

1057
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:03,920
whether that's in your work, or your hobby. Oh, yeah, politics. Whatever it is, when you push yourself

1058
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,800
at extra mile, it just feels so good. So this coming week, I please urge you. Find something

1059
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,480
you have not done before. Maybe you've considered you've been thinking about for a while and push

1060
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:21,040
yourself, push yourself at extra, extra inch or extra yard or extra mile and do it. You're going to

1061
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:33,200
feel fucking great. All right, everybody, that's it. Have yourselves a great weekend. I'll talk to you

1062
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,320
again on Monday, daily source code.com for the show notes. Adam and podshow.com for your emails

1063
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:43,760
and, uh, take care of yourself, bye, bye. Another podshow podcast. Stick it in your ear.

1064
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,800
Yet this podcast, and we're great ones like it on the high performance podcast delivery network

1065
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:00,160
from podshow and line-wight networks. I love it.
