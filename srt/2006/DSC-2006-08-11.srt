00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,500
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,500

I'm a narrator and this is the floor.

I'm a narrator and this is the floor.

79
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,500
I'm a narrator and this is the floor.

80
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
I'm a narrator and this is the floor.

81
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,500
I'm a narrator and this is the floor.

82
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:50,420
And I got the disco, the only difference between martyr-derman suicide is press coverage.

83
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,940
Ain't that the truth?

84
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,080
Newspapers around the globe plastered today on the front pages with the news of the

85
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,980
thwarted part terrorist plot to blow up planes from the United Kingdom to the U.S.

86
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,820
This shit has got to stop.

87
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,220
And I think I got some solutions for this.

88
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:15,060
First of all, this is what has happened right now, of course, nothing happened.

89
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,260
And I think we should be grateful nothing happened.

90
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,740
But I still would like a little bit more information about what was really planned.

91
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,460
I mean, all these stories of now we have liquid bombs.

92
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,340
If we didn't have dirty bombs, which were supposedly briefcase, nukes that are supposed

93
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,860
to go off all over the world, this has been the discussion for the past five to 10 years.

94
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,780
Now we have the liquid bombs, which can be carried in, they'd be formula bottles and detonated

95
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,780
with iPods.

96
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:47,140
We are so out of control right now that I'm still taking my shoes off at airport security

97
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:52,940
for some guy who had some matches in his shoe or something that was supposed to explode,

98
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,940
which didn't.

99
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,660
And that was also a very unclear story.

100
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,660
And we're still taking our shoes off for that.

101
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,900
So for the unforeseeable future, there will be nothing on the plane, nothing except the

102
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,140
inflight entertainment.

103
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,020
You want to be able to bring your own headphones because of course the liquid gel could

104
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,340
be explosive.

105
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,060
You know, what'll happen next is some guy is going to get caught with a stick of dynamite

106
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,700
shoved up his ass and then we'll all be subject to cavity searches and flying naked.

107
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,460
Actually, it's not such a bad thing.

108
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,460
It could be kind of interesting.

109
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,460
But you know what I'm saying?

110
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,740
Was it John of Kennedy who said the only thing we have to fear is fear itself?

111
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,260
We really got a grip, got a grip on ourselves right now about this.

112
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,260
And I have some ideas.

113
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,860
I couldn't get this leave last night.

114
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,460
I was thinking about how can we solve this terrorist issue?

115
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,460
One thing that's, what do I hear in the background?

116
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:51,500
Is regular sounds of the affluent suburb of Surrey and Gilford?

117
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,180
What can we do to actually stop this?

118
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,140
You know, security is just not going to work.

119
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,260
The example I gave you is not that far fetched.

120
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,260
You can't.

121
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,300
You just can't live a 100% secure life.

122
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,940
It's impossible.

123
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,620
Airlines can't be responsible for that.

124
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,260
It cannot deliver on that type of promise.

125
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,460
And people are really freaked out about this.

126
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,500
Are they even calling me?

127
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,420
Hey, Adam, it's Carmen Tyler.

128
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,420
You know, when I was watching the news this morning, I kept thinking, oh my gosh, you know,

129
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,420
how crazy is this?

130
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,100
So I was really concerned about all my friends in the UK.

131
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,100
And I just want to tell you to please, please, please, stay safe.

132
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,340
Only fly if you have to, obviously.

133
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,580
And of course, don't take any liquids of whatsoever.

134
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,180
So I just wanted to tell you that, to stay safe.

135
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,100
And just knowing that, you know, we have people all of the place thinking about to you

136
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,660
and praying for you and hoping that everyone over there, all my friends, you know, that

137
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,660
everyone's safe.

138
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,940
And hopefully, I can get these people who are doing this and trying to plan these crazy

139
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,940
things.

140
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,180
But again, just stay safe.

141
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,180
Oh, Carmen.

142
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,180
That's so sweet of you.

143
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,980
And I really do appreciate it.

144
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,860
And I can just, can you just tell by the sound and a voice that she's really freaked

145
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,860
out about this?

146
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,460
Don't get freaked out.

147
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,460
If I had to go to San Francisco today, I'd get on the plane no problem.

148
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,020
I would get on the plane yesterday.

149
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,060
I will get on any plane at any time.

150
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,780
I've really changed my attitude about this.

151
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:26,620
First of all, it seems that our security services are working quite fine, although the

152
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,260
new Scotland yard has had a couple of bumbles recently, picking up terrorists who turn out

153
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,540
not to be terrorists at all, which doesn't help.

154
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:39,660
I think really, it, as incredible as it may sound, I believe that Hollywood can actually

155
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,660
solve this problem.

156
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:47,140
You see, I don't know, I'm only going by what I have in the newspapers, and I guess there

157
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,540
has to be some semblance of truth in them.

158
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:55,540
Apparently of the 24 people they arrested, most of them were British.

159
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:01,020
One of them even prominently featured on the fine tabloid the sun.

160
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,540
Only just recently converted to Islam six months ago.

161
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,660
And of course, he was a very nice boy.

162
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,700
And the neighbors never suspected anything.

163
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,020
And we still don't know if he actually did anything, and we know very little actually

164
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,340
about what actually went down, although we got some pretty strong big words from George

165
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:26,420
Bush and from officials here in the United Kingdom that this was a plot for unprecedented

166
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,420
loss of life.

167
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,500
I mean, it's pretty scary stuff, you know, so the follow-up better be pretty damn good and

168
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,700
better be pretty quick, because if you're making these claims about how horrible it was,

169
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,620
I really want to see some evidence of that.

170
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,020
And swiftly, please, because otherwise you're just prolonging this fear effect and I don't

171
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,500
like that at all, because I don't like being scared, and I'm not scared, you cannot be

172
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,820
scared of these things, and then you can't live your life, because the trash can next

173
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,820
you could blow up.

174
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,820
The train could blow up.

175
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,700
You know, this is the whole point of terrorism, okay?

176
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,180
And we're really propagating it a little bit too much without enough information to back

177
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,180
it up.

178
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,180
Okay.

179
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,540
So that said, I think Hollywood can save us.

180
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,740
I really, really do.

181
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:16,260
What we need here is some influence, and one of my talking about religion, of course, has

182
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,140
been used throughout history to kill people.

183
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:27,060
It's been used quite effectively, and all kinds of religion, probably every single religion

184
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:34,420
at one point has been used or misused in war or as a reason to kill people.

185
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:43,460
Now why is this happening apparently with why is the religion the faith of Islam being

186
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,460
used for this?

187
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:51,820
Well, because there's not enough challenging information, I would say.

188
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:58,860
I mean, if you have some wise man who has studied your religion, I'm just going to leave

189
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,300
it religion as not agnostic, actually, it seems a lot easier, because it could be used for

190
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,300
any religion.

191
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,900
Anyone could be motivated to this through religion.

192
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,660
You know, you've got antique books and scriptures and history that goes back thousands

193
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:16,020
of years and interpretation, and it's very easy, very, very easy to influence someone

194
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,580
to do something fucked up.

195
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,020
It's not that hard to do.

196
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,940
So we need some countermeasures here.

197
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,940
We really do.

198
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:28,660
And I think we need an illusion on a grand scale because look, you know, if you do something

199
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,700
wrong, in the world, let's put it this way.

200
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,420
In the world, there's always someone who's going to go record up for everybody else.

201
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,020
And does it matter if you're in kindergarten, if you're in grade school, if you're in the

202
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,060
work force, if you're in government, it doesn't matter.

203
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,380
There's always someone who's there to fuck it up.

204
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,180
Always someone is going to do something to mess up everybody else's game.

205
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,340
That I think is just human nature.

206
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,940
You're not going to stop that.

207
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:59,220
Why do people stop or why is it a small amount of people is because there's something,

208
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,540
but there's some penalty that is above you.

209
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,140
And the penalty is, you know, the teacher's going to kick your ass, you get sent to the

210
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,780
principal's office, you'll get fired, you can go to jail.

211
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:15,180
I mean, we have all these things that up in society, but when it comes to, this is what

212
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:21,740
your God has told you to do, well, you know, what's the consequence for not doing it?

213
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,980
Neal Dixon is escaping me.

214
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,340
Neal, I'm recording, stop it.

215
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,940
Excuse me.

216
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:33,380
Senseioh, brought to you by Bridecaster.com.

217
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:41,260
So, you know, there is no visible or known consequence for going against your God.

218
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:47,540
So what if Hollywood had God speak to everyone, and it could be your own God, it could

219
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,460
be God, it could be Allah, it could be Buddha, it could be whatever, you know, I'm thinking

220
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:57,980
very much along the lines of, well, like walking on the moon, and of course, we all know

221
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,180
we didn't actually walk on the moon, but we all believe it because we have great pictures

222
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,180
of it.

223
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,940
I'm one of those guys, indeed.

224
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:12,380
There's so many different examples of things that really aren't proven, but have been

225
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,620
proven to people because they sought with their own eyes, they think, but they really

226
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,260
sought through television or read it in the newspaper or heard about it on the radio.

227
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:27,420
So why don't we bring together like Spielberg and Copperfield, and instead of the propagating

228
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:33,340
the myth that if you become a martyr and in this one particular instance, again, trying

229
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:38,660
to be as agnostic as possible, but right now we're talking about how Islam is being misused.

230
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:45,940
So instead of propagating the, who knows, it may even be truth, you might get 42 versions

231
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,340
if you become a martyr, I don't know, but we've got to create some kind of offensive

232
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,340
here.

233
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,300
There's no amount of weaponry, there's no amount of security that is actually going

234
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,220
to stop anyone from doing this.

235
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,460
So we've got to have God's peak.

236
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,460
We can make this happen.

237
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,100
We could have a real illusion.

238
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,100
We've done it before, like JFK.

239
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,740
We all know we got off by the CIA, no one can prove it, so we had the capability, certainly

240
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:14,740
the United States and that it came together, have enough governmental talent and creative

241
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:19,140
talent to put together this high, this very high illusion.

242
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:28,380
The basically says, hey, if you think that the message you'll get 42 versions is right,

243
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,820
think again, you know, don't go blowing up airplanes, don't go blowing up people, don't

244
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:38,460
go killing people because you wind up in hell, that's the only message we have to have

245
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:45,780
some kind of counterbalance, and a part of that by the way, might be to put a lot more

246
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:50,860
learning about all religion on, on television, BBC, do more about it.

247
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,380
We need some counterbalance here.

248
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:59,020
We've got guys who look old and wise and who have Xbox 360s to keep you busy when they're

249
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:04,460
not preaching, preaching nasty religious stuff to you, that got him hypnotizing kids.

250
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,020
So we've got to hypnotize them back, we've got to use what we have.

251
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,020
It can be done.

252
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,020
Think about it.

253
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:14,340
Don't just scoff at me, think about it, there is no other solution, but to counterbalance

254
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:22,100
the message that is being sent about what happens to you if you become a martyr.

255
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,100
Where's Copperfield's number?

256
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,100
I'm going to call myself.

257
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,100

270

Hey Adam, David Ipolito here, that guitarman from Central Park.

271
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,780
Yes, I am doing a podcast.

272
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,780
It's called, I love the company.

273
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,780
People can find it at thatcontarman.com.

274
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,780
I just got to say, I'm so glad you got that $16 million worth of airplane

275
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,780
strapped to your ass, because I'm a little different.

276
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,780
This is a new song I'm working on.

277
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,780
I got a piece of wood and six string strapped to my shoulder.

278
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,780
But listen, you know any artist that I find on the Podsake music network

279
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,780
and I've found a lot of great artists for the podcast.

280
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,780
If I dig it, man, I'll play it.

281
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,780
And if any of them are coming through New York City, tell them to give me a shout

282
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,780
because I will have them sit in as my guest artist in Central Park

283
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,780
or down on pure 45 or American concert hall.

284
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,780
Introduce them to a whole new audience.

285
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,780
It's getting to be a very small campus man and thank you.

286
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,780
Thank you for what you're doing.

287
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,780
By the way, you're not the first person that I heard you the other day on the source

288
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,780
quotes.

289
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,780
It's a guitar dude.

290
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,780
It's a guitar guy.

291
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,780
It's guitar man.

292
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,780
But I've been called all kinds of things.

293
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,780
Even the James Taylor guy.

294
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,780
So I had a write a song about it.

295
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,780
I'll send it off to you.

296
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,780
David, I actually apologized because that was a completely

297
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,780
insensitive of me and I should have known better.

298
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,780
And of course, it all would have taken us from me to just look at a website

299
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,780
to know that it was that guitar man.com.

300
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,780
Because I have always kind of detested being that MTV guy

301
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,780
or like the big haired fact stuff like that.

302
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,780
So I can make up by playing that song that you sent me.

303
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,780
I love it though.

304
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,780
Through my nose, David.

305
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,780
That guitar man.

306
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:55,780
When I open up my mouth to sing something happens to my voice.

307
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,780
Something that I can't explain.

308
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,780
It's really not by choice.

309
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,780
Imitating other artists.

310
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,780
It's not what I'm about.

311
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:11,780
But when I open up my mouth sometimes.

312
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,780
Somebody else pops out.

313
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,780
I don't mean to do it.

314
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,780
It's kind of silly I suppose.

315
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,780
But when I sing James Taylor songs,

316
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,780
I just start singing through my nose.

317
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,780
Imagine sounding like jumping in.

318
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,780
I'm sure the Julian can relate.

319
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,780
I dreamt I didn't sound like me.

320
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,780
Although I think me a young's great.

321
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,780
I sing low like new diamond.

322
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,780
When I sing sweet Caroline.

323
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,780
And when I sing like Paul Simon,

324
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,780
people seem to like it fine.

325
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,780
But I don't mean to do it.

326
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,780
It's a talent I suppose.

327
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,780
Like when I sing James Taylor songs,

328
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,780
I just start singing through my nose.

329
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,780
Sometimes I'm Jimmy Buffett.

330
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,780
When I sing a key where song.

331
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,780
I can sound like Barry Manelow.

332
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,780
But that's just sick and wrong.

333
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,780
I get tangled up and dealing.

334
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,780
I'm Charlie Daniel's southern draw.

335
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:45,780
Or even William Shattner when I pause for no reason at all.

336
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,780
But I don't mean to do it.

337
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,780
I'm an asshole I suppose.

338
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:59,780
And when I sing James Taylor songs,

339
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,780
I just start singing through my nose.

340
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,780
That guitarman calm.

341
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,780
David E. Polito.

342
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,780
Through my nose.

343
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,780
Short sweet and very mental.

344
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,780
Very to the point.

345
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,780
A portion of the show brought to you by the new AccurRDX.

346
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,780
They have a target cast.

347
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,780
Which is not a podcast.

348
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,780
Trying, you know, it's not a,

349
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,780
I was like, what's the one post over there?

350
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,780
Oh, a parking from from the UK from London.

351
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,780
He said, oh, it's another advertisement posing as a podcast.

352
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,780
No, dude.

353
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,780
It's a target cast.

354
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,780
It actually says it's like an info commercial.

355
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,780
Only I think it's really good.

356
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,780
If you go listen to it,

357
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,780
you'll hear that there's some real information in there.

358
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,780
If you're interested,

359
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,780
if you're not that target cast is not for you.

360
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,780
It's only for people who are interested.

361
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,780
So if you're not interested in buying an SUV,

362
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,780
if you're not interested in AccurRD.

363
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,780
If you're not interested in learning about the surround sound system,

364
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,780
if you want to hear Grammy award winning producer,

365
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,780
how he was involved in the design of that system,

366
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,780
then go and listen to AccurRDX.

367
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:10,780
More people sending in comments about the new fear terror in the skies.

368
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,780
Hey, Adam John here,

369
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,780
lawyer listener from nearby send in the affluent several of us.

370
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,780
Sorry.

371
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,780
More time listener.

372
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,780
I don't have my own podcast.

373
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,780
I'm a scruncher.

374
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:30,780
But thought I would give you a tip with no MP3s or laptops

375
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,780
going in any of the intercontinental flights.

376
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,780
These days,

377
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,780
he throw you out of talk to B.A.

378
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,780
about making sure that the daily source code is on there.

379
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,780
In flight entertainment,

380
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,780
because there's a lot of people that are going to be bombed out

381
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,780
and without their daily source code to listen to you on their long flights.

382
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,780
So that'd be a really good source entertainment.

383
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,780
I get in touch.

384
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,780
Thanks, man.

385
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,780
Great.

386
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,780
Well, thank you.

387
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,780
Well, you know what's going to happen now is people are going to actually use the

388
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,780
in flight entertainment to find out how incredibly lame it is.

389
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,780
Although I must say on Virgin,

390
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,780
they've got good movies.

391
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,780
They refresh those every month, so that works for me.

392
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,780
But you watch people saying,

393
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,780
yeah, I actually listen to that in flight entertainment.

394
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,780
Socks ass.

395
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,780
Where's my iPod?

396
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,780
You mean that detonation device you have?

397
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:19,780
Not just regular ass listeners affected,

398
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,780
but some regulars as well.

399
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,780
Comics trip.

400
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,780
Comics trip.

401
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,780
Comics trip.

402
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,780
Comics trip.

403
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,780
Comics trip.

404
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,780
Comics trip.

405
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,780
Comics trip.

406
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,780
Comics trip.

407
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,780
Comics trip.

408
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,780
Comics trip.

409
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,780
Hiya.

410
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,780
Adam Kerry.

411
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,780
Here's comics to a blogger from comicsstripblock.com.

412
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,780
I must admit something.

413
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,780
I have been defeated by terrorists.

414
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,780
Why?

415
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,780
Well, I had etiquettes from for a visit from Germany.

416
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,780
Let me just translate because I had listened to it three times.

417
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:56,780
He says he's been affected by terrorists because he had a ticket to visit the UK from Germany.

418
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,780
London.

419
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,780
Already paid for this weekend.

420
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,780
Outbound flight was on August 12th.

421
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,780
One Saturday, but I can't set my flights.

422
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,780
And the visit to London.

423
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:15,780
Due to the hate and security at UK airports that resulted from the massive terrorist attack

424
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,780
that was just prevented by British police.

425
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,780
I would like you to tell me.

426
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,780
What do you think?

427
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,780
What do you see?

428
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,780
Listen as think.

429
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:30,780
Was it correct behavior on my path to cancel the visit this weekend to London?

430
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,780
Basically for tourist purposes.

431
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,780
Due to the situation on British airports.

432
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:41,780
From my excuse, I can say that I have read that BBC such messages like, for example,

433
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:49,780
passengers have been urged to contact their airlines and not travel unless it is absolutely necessary.

434
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,780
So I fought it by consolation.

435
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,780
I would not exasperate the situation.

436
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,780
But I feel defeated, I feel bad.

437
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:00,780
Some even say to me, some things like,

438
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,780
no, you idiot.

439
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,780
You did a wrong thing.

440
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:08,780
People like you are giving the terrorist exactly what they want.

441
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,780
So you do.

442
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,780
I think cancel my visit to London this weekend.

443
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,780
Yeah.

444
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,780
Poor CSB.

445
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,780
Well, you got to do what you got to do.

446
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,780
I think that it will probably help with congestion because everything is pretty messed up right now.

447
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,780
So that will help somewhat.

448
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,780
So I think that's why they're saying it.

449
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,780
It's not only travel if you absolutely have to.

450
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,780
And if you didn't have to, you don't have to.

451
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,780
There's no big deal there.

452
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:39,780
But of course, you're giving terrorists exactly what they want them out of where these terrorists are from.

453
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,780
Fear of fear itself is what it comes down to.

454
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,780
And quite honestly, I think that if, you know, I'm an American, you know that.

455
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,780
I also feel very European.

456
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,780
Soon I'll be an official resident.

457
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,780
Well, I already official resident in the European Union.

458
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,780
I guess that's senseless.

459
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:05,780
But I feel that if we can send troops over anywhere in the world.

460
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,780
I don't care what they're fighting for.

461
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,780
They're obviously fighting on our behalf.

462
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,780
Then I can take my my shots as well.

463
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,780
So I would get on the plane for sure.

464
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,780
This of course is my mother-in-law who is calling.

465
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:22,780
And my mother-in-law has the habit of letting the phone ring for about 50 rings.

466
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,780
I'm just not going to leave my studio here.

467
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:32,780
What I will do is tell all the folks on Syria satellite or who are listening to Syria satellite.

468
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,780
Stars 102 that we've got a great lineup for your Friday evening.

469
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:41,780
Of course, so we hear every weekday afternoon from 6 to 10 Eastern PM.

470
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,780
Up next we've got Pacific Coast Hallway followed by Don and Drew.

471
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,780
Then in over your head, we should talk rather third.

472
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,780
The scenes in East Radio at 9 o'clock and winding up with Scott Sigler.

473
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,780
And I'll see you all on Monday.

474
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,780
And the phone will probably still be ringing.

475
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,780
Hey, what timing it stopped?

476
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,780
Uh, hold on a second.

477
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,780
That's something that else I wanted to say about that.

478
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,780
Anyway, if you want to call in, happy to hear from you.

479
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:16,780
The voicemail numbers put it in yourself on now plus 1, 2, 0, 1, 6, 2, 5, 6, 3, 5, 7, rewind.

480
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:22,780
Plus 1, 2, 0, 1, 6, 2, 5, 6, 3, 5, 7, 9 or if you prefer and you're in London.

481
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:27,780
It's easier for you, 0, 2, 0, 7, 6, 8, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3.

482
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,780
I've been asking you to call in, tell me about yourself.

483
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,780
Wanted to learn about our listeners.

484
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:38,780
I have to say, I think that the average age of the daily source code listener is hovering around

485
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,780
30 years old, which is very interesting.

486
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,780
A lot of people who are in technology.

487
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,780
Of course, the women are always holding them back and women never want to call in.

488
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,780
I know you're out there.

489
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,780
Give me some more calls if you don't mind.

490
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,780
And of course, when you call in, just let me know.

491
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,780
And obviously, I can't play all of these on the show.

492
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,780
But, you know, I love hearing who you are.

493
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,780
And I'm adjusting the show towards what you want and where you listen to it.

494
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,780
So the more information you tell me, it really is, it's better.

495
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,780
Hopefully, it just make a better show for you.

496
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,780
So, you know, include all the pertinent information, like your age, where you're from,

497
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,780
when you listen to the show, maybe what other shows you listen to.

498
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,780
And, of course, if you're a scruncher or folder.

499
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,780
Hey Adam, this is Audra from Conqueror, New Hampshire 31.

500
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:26,780
I've been listening to you since, let's see, last, last, last May.

501
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,780
So over here now, enjoy the show.

502
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,780
Let's see, I owe my own business.

503
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,780
I have two free children and I'm a folder.

504
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,780
Thanks.

505
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,780
Right now?

506
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,780
Of course you're a folder.

507
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,780
Excuse me, gastronomic.

508
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,780
It's a more I'm going to go flying.

509
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:52,780
I'm going to go practice on my landings.

510
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:58,780
As the only part, I still got to kind of work on.

511
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,780
So Captain Dan and I are going to a couple of grass strips.

512
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:05,780
So I can't smoke the tires too badly, because that just gets really expensive, dude.

513
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,780
So that'll be on tomorrow's schedule.

514
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,780
I think the Patricia and her sister have something planned for Sunday.

515
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,780
And then on Monday, I hope to get them both on the show.

516
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,780
So we can, yeah, about have some fun.

517
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,780
Oh, hi, Adam.

518
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,780
May is column.

519
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,780
So again, let's go back for a whole event.

520
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,780
I'm listening to DSC for 39.

521
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:29,780
And I don't say off taking your advice to Google,

522
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,780
I'm going to participate in Google images.

523
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,780
I'm going to 16 year old, but very happy.

524
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,780
Thanks.

525
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,780
Bye.

526
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,780
Uh-huh.

527
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:46,780
And the pictures you saw are probably the ones that she made for Playboy Magazine.

528
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,780
When she was 50 years old, five years old.

529
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:53,780
She was on the cover of Playboy, the Dutch Playboy, four times.

530
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:58,780
I think when she was like 28 or something, she was also in the US Playboy.

531
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:03,780
But indeed, just Google Patricia Pi, Papa Alpha Alpha Yankee,

532
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,780
you will not be disappointed.

533
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,780
Hi, Adam.

534
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,780
Ten Elliott.

535
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,780
They're going to be forward up.

536
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,780
Hey, I was listening to DSC for 34.

537
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,780
And you mentioned the book on marketing.

538
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,780
One of the best pieces of marketing advice I've ever heard is

539
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,780
Quit trying to market the groups.

540
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:23,780
If you want to market to architect pick one architect that you know

541
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,780
and solve his problems.

542
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:30,780
Because often times, we as a market group represent a large number of people who

543
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,780
have the same type of problems for doing the same type of work.

544
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:38,780
If you take a market group and that in which half of the people are hot and

545
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,780
half of the people are cold and you design something where the temperatures

546
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,780
in between, you get half of the people who are too cold and half of the

547
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,780
people that are too hot and therefore the product is acceptable to nobody.

548
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,780
Keep up the good work, dude.

549
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,780
Stay dangerous.

550
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,780
Folder.

551
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,780
Excellent.

552
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,780
Yeah.

553
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,780
Thanks, man.

554
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,780
Well, you know, that's exactly what we've been doing.

555
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,780
And it hasn't been pleasing the podcast community too much because

556
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,780
people are used to doing things a certain way that you see certain elements

557
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:11,780
and we've been working on our, on our stuff, podshow plus for listeners.

558
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,780
And so we've picked listeners that we're trying to delight.

559
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:18,780
And of course, we're there for also not delighting or in fact even

560
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,780
confusing other groups of people.

561
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,780
Hello, Adam.

562
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,780
Paul Nichols here.

563
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,780
Podcast Paul.

564
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,780
And I'm just a few very quick things.

565
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:29,780
The first thing is podshow plus I really do like the idea of the thing.

566
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,780
But I'm a complete techno-thobe, not techno-thobe.

567
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,780
I can't, I just don't understand anything really.

568
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,780
I don't know.

569
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,780
There's an F.A. Cube that that would do it doesn't mean anything to me

570
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,780
to be honest.

571
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,780
Have you got like a complete idiot sky to it, please?

572
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,780
And what's this feed vacuum thing?

573
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,780
I can just about turn on the proper vacuum.

574
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,780
I can't even work out how to fix in the attachments.

575
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,780
But that's another story.

576
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:56,780
And, oh yes, I'm a 38-year-old male from Birmingham.

577
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,780
Married with four kids or boys.

578
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,780
And I'm neither a folder or a scruncher.

579
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,780
I am a rapper.

580
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:07,780
I don't mean one of those nice blokes that rhymes his lingo.

581
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,780
And with Doctor, I sort of wrap it around, I think, three fingers.

582
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,780
I actually thought about that a little bit as I was laughing me bum.

583
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,780
I mean, I really think of that idea.

584
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,780
But much more important than that.

585
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,780
Are you a standard or are you a sister?

586
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,780
In fact, this is always in trouble.

587
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,780
Oh, hold on a second.

588
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,780
I really liked that.

589
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,780
There was a gem hidden in there.

590
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,780
It does work this stuff, you know.

591
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,780
So what is the point of this folder scruncher?

592
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,780
The point is, everyone does it.

593
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,780
Everyone does one version or the other.

594
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:41,780
And exactly what I hoped would happen is now starting to happen

595
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,780
when he was wiping his bum.

596
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,780
No, it's so proper the way he said it.

597
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,780
He was thinking of the daily source code.

598
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,780
That would be the whole point of the answer to that.

599
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,780
Because you can't really ask many people.

600
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,780
Can you call or go to them as you set the water cooler and say,

601
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,780
how exactly do you want me back inside John?

602
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,780
Because that give you a strange look.

603
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,780
But we can talk about it and it can't be.

604
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,780
It's the done thing.

605
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,780
I'm a rugby player.

606
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,780
So I've got big tackle, if you know what I mean.

607
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,780
And I can't really understand the logistics of if you're a sitter.

608
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,780
How do you do that to you?

609
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,780
Give yourself a half now.

610
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:19,780
Some by going around the back or, well, there's no space to go around the front.

611
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,780
Another more wife is a sitter.

612
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,780
But like I said, she has a rugby tackle.

613
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:28,780
But anyways, some standar legs apart and stay together slightly.

614
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,780
If that means anything to you.

615
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,780
Just imagine the Ministry of Civil War.

616
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,780
If you know the faulty towers, sketch or other issues,

617
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,780
you should say multi python.

618
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:40,780
Anyway, this comment is brought to you not by my show.

619
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,780
So I'm not going to promote that.

620
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,780
But the absolutely fantastic Lynn Parsons red light zone.

621
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,780
And if you haven't heard it, it is absolutely blooming brilliant.

622
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,780
Really, really love it.

623
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,780
Okay, all the best mates.

624
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,780
See ya.

625
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,780
Bye.

626
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,780
Yo dude.

627
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,780
Oh, what's this?

628
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,780
Extra audio.

629
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:08,780
All right.

630
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,780
Yo man.

631
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,780
Yeah, I'll tell you just because you ask.

632
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,780
I'm a sitter.

633
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,780
But that's not important.

634
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,780
I think we just leave it at scrunching and folding.

635
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,780
It's innocent enough.

636
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,780
It doesn't gross you out too much.

637
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,780
And whenever you're folding or scrunching,

638
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,780
either way is good.

639
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,780
Just thinking of me.

640
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,780
And that's what it's really all about.

641
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,780
There's a lot of racket going on here.

642
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,780
I think the girls didn't understand.

643
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,780
And I was going to go do a show.

644
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,780
Hey.

645
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,780
Female caller.

646
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,780
Hi Adam.

647
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,780
This isn't a call.

648
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,780
And I wanted to call for three reasons.

649
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:43,780
The first reason is that you still haven't told us that Sebastian

650
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,780
box story.

651
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,780
The second reason.

652
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,780
I'd love to have an earthlink challenge again.

653
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,780
All right.

654
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,780
You want this.

655
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,780
I'll do this Sebastian box story next week.

656
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,780
It's another one from Moscow.

657
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,780
But it's pretty good.

658
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,780
Okay.

659
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,780
And now the earthlink thing.

660
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,780
Maybe a product that I can relate to and that I use and that I have something to say about.

661
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,780
It was a great experiment and hopefully the advertisers are listening and you'll have something

662
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,780
for us real soon.

663
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:11,780
The third reason is you can check out my show at somethingmissing.podshow.com.

664
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,780
Thanks to the efforts of Pod Show.

665
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,780
I was finally able to get up and running on my own.

666
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,780
And now I've got something to say.

667
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,780
Oh.

668
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,780
And even though girls should never admit that they actually go to the bathroom.

669
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,780
I'm a scruncher.

670
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,780
Oh.

671
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,780
Actually, I think this makes five.

672
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,780
But Patricia, we love hearing you.

673
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,780
Every morning getting the DSC is a lot like getting a little gift.

674
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:35,780
And when it's with Adam, it's the excitement of getting a box from Amazon.

675
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,780
I love getting boxes from amazon.com.

676
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:41,780
But when you're on, it's like getting a box from red envelope or something with just

677
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,780
really pretty packaging.

678
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,780
So please keep coming on everyone's in a while.

679
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,780
She will.

680
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,780
I promise you.

681
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,780
Yeah.

682
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,780
Well, first of all, very successful the ad challenge.

683
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,780
And of course, the ad challenge will continue because it's not just specific to earthlink.

684
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,780
The ad challenge will remain.

685
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:00,780
So yes, I can totally see what we have more products and or services.

686
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,780
And hopefully we can build this out into something much on a much grander scale.

687
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:09,780
But it really does seem to work very well where each individual podcast.

688
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,780
There's a relationship between the producer who is often also the host.

689
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,780
But the producer of that show and the audience.

690
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:20,780
So it only makes sense that you have a conversation with your audience about stuff that you're

691
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,780
promoting that you're advertising, etc.

692
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,780
So in this case, we started off with earthlink.

693
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,780
Here's one of the finalists, by the way, which is vying towards that thousands of

694
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,780
dollars of prize money.

695
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:36,780
And of course, the reward of actually being the chosen commercial that will run in

696
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,780
pod shows.

697
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,780
This is Steve Webb with the Life Spring Family podcast.

698
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:44,780
You know, it's not often that your local cable company does any favors for you, right?

699
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,780
But when I signed up for high speed internet, they really did a good thing.

700
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:52,780
Included with our high speed internet access was access to all of earthlink services.

701
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,780
I wasn't too impressed at the time because I'd never used earthlink.

702
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:00,780
But as I started using the earthlink email, their parental controls, their pop-up blocker.

703
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,780
Well, this was long time before Firefox.

704
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:07,780
And the highly effective spam blocker, I really began to rely on earthlink's rock solid

705
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,780
service and reliability.

706
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,780
Then after I'd been with them for a year or so, our cable company realized what they

707
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,780
done, that they'd actually done something good for their customers.

708
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,780
So, of course, they had to rectify that.

709
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,780
Right.

710
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,780
No more would earthlink be included with our internet service.

711
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:26,780
If we wanted to keep our earthlink, we'd have to pay, above and beyond the already escalating

712
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,780
prices that our cable company was charging.

713
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,780
Well, there was no way I wanted to give up all the great services and reliability I was

714
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,780
used to.

715
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,780
So, yep.

716
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,780
I've been at paying customer of earthlink for years now, and I can recommend them

717
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,780
highly.

718
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,780
Give them the try and see if you don't agree.

719
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,780
Yep.

720
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,780
There you go.

721
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,780
It doesn't get any better than that.

722
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,780
People willing to pay extra just to have earthlink services.

723
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,780
You know, Andrew Grummit, he had to work on the D-gap stuff.

724
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,780
We were having all those errors, which are fixed now, by the way.

725
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,780
I think all the, well, there's still reports coming in from episode 436 and 437.

726
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,780
So, we pretty much have it all fixed as far as I know.

727
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:03,780
And he was on vacation somewhere where he did have a laptop, but there was absolutely no

728
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,780
Starbucks or any wireless, any Wi-Fi around.

729
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,780
And so, guess what he used?

730
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,780
Yep.

731
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:12,780
He got himself a dial-up account with earthlink.

732
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,780
You'd think we had a couple of those on standby.

733
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,780
We didn't.

734
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,780
But he got one and was able to save the day.

735
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:21,780
There's another endorsement for the fine services of earthlink.

736
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,780
Hey, Adam.

737
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,780
This is a message for your listener profiles.

738
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,780
My name is Richard Brennan.

739
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,780
I'm a slacker from Gostown, New Hampshire.

740
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,780
43 years young.

741
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,780
Long time listener and first time caller.

742
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:38,780
I just wanted to comment that I really enjoyed your exercise segment for a few days.

743
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,780
I hope you do more of them.

744
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:46,780
And I totally sympathized with your bones and bones that you were experiencing.

745
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,780
You know, you're back aching and so on.

746
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,780
And I love working out myself at a local gym.

747
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,780
But what's interesting, Adam, that I wanted to comment is that I've created this sort of

748
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,780
activity channel in my real life.

749
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,780
That is, I use the Charlie as my workout audio.

750
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:05,780
And the pairing of working out on the stairmaster or the electrical trainer.

751
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,780
And listening to the chuck is perfect for me.

752
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:12,780
For some reason I can do more time on the aerobic segment of my workout.

753
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,780
If I'm listening to you and I've tried other podcasts.

754
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,780
But nothing works like your show and listening to the various things that you can talk about.

755
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,780
When you're exercising like that, it kind of occupies a part of your brains.

756
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:27,780
You can work out with being without being conscious of how hard you're working.

757
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:33,780
So ideally, I set up one or two Charlie's to catch up on.

758
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,780
And I do about, you know, 40 minutes on the elliptical trainer.

759
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:41,780
And you've been my workout buddies since some time last year.

760
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:46,780
So I just wanted to also make a quick plug for what I do when I'm doing my weights.

761
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:50,780
The weight segment of my workout, which is I listen to the Randy Rhodes show.

762
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,780
I don't know if you know her show from Aramaica Radio.

763
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,780
She's got a podcast version of her show on iTunes.

764
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:00,780
Awesome talk show, Radio Woman, who makes fun of our current administration.

765
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,780
She's really funny and really biting commentary.

766
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,780
But she also has a great opening song at him that you'd love.

767
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,780
It's called Bounce Your Boobies.

768
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,780
And I kid you not. You should seriously take it out.

769
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,780
And let me know if you think of that sounds good.

770
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,780
You love boobies.

771
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,780
Yeah. So Adam, when you're doing that bridge, you ask your size.

772
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,780
Yeah.

773
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,780
I was, I think that's what you're called.

774
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:26,780
And I was also thinking that maybe you should try yoga based on how your back was hurting

775
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,780
towards.

776
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,780
I'm taking yoga teacher training this fall.

777
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,780
And maybe I can give you a few pointers after I'm certified.

778
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,780
You do strike me as a kind of guy that could get into yoga.

779
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:43,780
But you'd have to first make the decision to slow down and get on the mat and relax.

780
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,780
Anyway, that's for the future.

781
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,780
It's all for now. Thanks for being in my workout buddy.

782
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,780
See you at the gym. Thanks for being you.

783
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,780
No, I have to.

784
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,780
And by the way, I'm a folder standard.

785
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,780
Looker.

786
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,780
Folder standard, looker.

787
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,780
And FSL. Oh, yeah. Oh, boy.

788
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:02,780
You know, our financial director, Mark Sierra is, I think I don't

789
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,780
if he's a certified yoga instructor, but he's way into it.

790
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:11,780
And I think during one of our battle against the cookie bulge at pod show,

791
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,780
which is on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

792
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,780
I think he did a yoga class one time.

793
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:21,780
Yeah. I've already started on my back and I started on that.

794
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,780
Almost two years ago when I quit riding motorcycles.

795
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,780
That's when I really fucked up my back.

796
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,780
Because after a pretty bad tumble I made.

797
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:34,780
I did want to mention that I spoke to Amanda Monaco of the

798
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,780
Sivius Bitties. I called her yesterday and she called me back this morning.

799
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,780
Just about as I was to record the show actually.

800
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,780
And as she likes the talk, we just talked and talked and it was quite nice actually.

801
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,780
Not able to hook up.

802
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,780
Unfortunately, today is not a good day for me to go into the city.

803
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,780
I got a lot of stuff to do here and then, well, you know, tomorrow already

804
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,780
have my flying set up on Sunday.

805
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,780
The girls have something, I don't know, and that's when Amanda is actually

806
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,780
leaving.

807
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,780
So we promised to hook up in New York.

808
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,780
It will be me, the Bitties, and karaoke.

809
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:07,780
Apparently, they have some awesome place where they are karaoke stars.

810
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:13,780
Oh, yes, one other thing, here we go.

811
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,780
So yesterday, if you missed the show,

812
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:22,780
you know, I hadn't really forgotten our 18th wedding anniversary, but we don't usually

813
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,780
make a big deal out of anniversary.

814
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,780
Little did I know that 18, of course, was supposed to be a big deal.

815
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:32,780
And so I kind of messed up on presents and flowers and I got some flowers

816
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,780
on the way back from the airport at the gas station.

817
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,780
It literally nailed me on.

818
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,780
And then yesterday, a beautiful bouquet of roses showed up.

819
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,780
And it said Patricia happy anniversary.

820
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,780
Please forgive Adam.

821
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,780
He asked me to get these to you on your anniversary since he was going to be

822
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,780
busy.

823
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,780
And I got toasted, and I just plain forgot.

824
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,780
It's all my fault that he got those horrible gas station flowers.

825
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,780
And it wasn't signed.

826
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,780
I found out who did this.

827
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,780
Oh, man.

828
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,780
Shall we make another contest out of it?

829
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,780
Hmm.

830
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,780
Now, forget about it.

831
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,780
PW Fenton, man.

832
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,780
I love you.

833
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,780
Thank you.

834
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,780
That was so incredibly nice.

835
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,780
I feel to do that.

836
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,780
Oh, Adam, my name is Alex McCoy.

837
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,780
I'm just cooling the kiss on a hot glass listener.

838
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,780
I don't have a hot glass to wear.

839
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,780
But I would recommend the Emirant teacher.

840
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,780
That's WWWG.

841
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,780
Emma and Pete Docscom.

842
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,780
Just laying you know, first of all, that I'm a fall to get that out of the way.

843
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:31,780
And secondly, to just see if are the you, Patricia, or Christina,

844
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:37,780
have any recommendations for places to see if fuel food planning to visit.

845
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,780
Sometime next week.

846
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,780
Can you even potentially house one?

847
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,780
Oh, wait a minute.

848
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,780
Wait a minute.

849
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,780
So places to see in Gilford.

850
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:48,780
Well, of course, we have all kinds of wonderful things to see in Gilford.

851
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,780
Just stay around the high street.

852
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,780
And if you're with your wife, she'll be plenty busy on a problem.

853
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,780
Go to the castle grounds.

854
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,780
That's nice.

855
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,780
There's a great, a great museum up on the top of the hill.

856
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,780
I think there's even a time capsule there at Gilford Castle.

857
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,780
Yeah, there's lots and lots of nice stuff to see.

858
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,780
But this house hunting thing you mentioned kind of worries me.

859
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:16,780
So I sent a message, especially we're looking for good places to be in eat, get some ideas.

860
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,780
OK, good places to eat.

861
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,780
Cafe de Paris, or Cafe Rouge.

862
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:26,780
These are all next to each other on Church Street.

863
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:30,780
And then the final one is Loch.

864
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,780
Was it Loch Finn fish restaurant?

865
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,780
Great restaurants.

866
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,780
There's not so good areas of Gilford to live.

867
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,780
And also schools, again, if there's anything that's good or not so good.

868
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,780
I mean, don't have a good weekend.

869
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,780
Again, bye.

870
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,780
Sure, sure.

871
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,780
Thanks.

872
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:52,780
So yeah, you know, we're house hunting ourselves here in Gilford.

873
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,780
And all of Gilford is pretty much great.

874
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,780
You know, there's fantastic schools everywhere.

875
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,780
It's just, it's a fantastic affluent suburb.

876
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,780
But because it's so affluent and because it's so desirable,

877
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,780
it's very hard to find housing.

878
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:10,780
You know, we've been looking for over a year now and have not been successful.

879
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,780
You know, we came very close and got gazumped.

880
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,780
Our first gazumping.

881
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,780
Of course, it was also on our first offer, which kind of sucked.

882
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,780
You know, just stay away from Gilford.

883
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,780
Don't come live here.

884
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,780
Please.

885
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,780
It's nice here.

886
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,780
We don't want any more problems with housings.

887
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,780
Stay away.

888
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,780
Do not come to Gilford.

889
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,780
Please.

890
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,780

941

It's speed baby from the gentleman. They have a great out-mount called Blonsperfer the gentleman.

942
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:42,780
This song rocks. It's a lot of fun. You got to turn this up really, really loud.
