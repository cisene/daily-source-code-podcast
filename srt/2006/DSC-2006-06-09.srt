Feel so guilty

13
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,320
You're just the pilot

14
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,320
Of the world and the rush

15
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,320
This crazy life we live in is all a part of the way

16
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,320
Oh

17
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,320
She's under self attack

18
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,320
Can't do this, can't do that

19
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,320
Or she might lose her precious hands

20
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,320
Watch her figure, watch her blade

21
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,320
Clean out that empty blade

22
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,320
Girl you know that ain't the way to live

23
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,320
Time for social intervention

24
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,320
Listen girl, pay close attention

25
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,320
Hey, hey, seriously, you can't let your head down

26
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,320
You ain't done nothing bad and nothing feels so guilty

27
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
You're just the pilot

28
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,320
Of the world and rush

29
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,320
This crazy life we live in is all a part of the way

30
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,320
Oh

31
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,320
Oh

32
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Oh

33
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,320
You ain't never gonna praise them

34
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,320
No, but you don't have to worry about that thing

35
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,320
You don't need them

36
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:38,320
Hey, hey, seriously, you can let your head down

37
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,320
You ain't done nothing bad and nothing feels so guilty

38
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,320
You're just the pilot

39
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,320
Of the world and the rush

40
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:54,320
This crazy life we live in is all a part of the way

41
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:00,320
Crazy life we live in is all a part of the way

42
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,320
Oh

43
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,320
I don't care what you said

44
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,320
That's a Friday song

45
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,320
Absolutely

46
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,320
Laura Clap, hey, hey sister from the podcast music network

47
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,320
Kicking off the Friday show of the daily source code

48
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,320
Or should we just call it by its proper name

49
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
Mr. Curry

50
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
No, the lady and the tramp

51
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,320
No, I'm saying ha, Mr. Curry

52
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,320
How are you?

53
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
Thank you, Mrs. Curry

54
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
I was saying that's the name of our show now

55
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,320
The lady and the tramp

56
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,320
Is that right?

57
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Lady and a friend

58
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
I'm a friend

59
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
I'm not a friend

60
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,320
No, what do you mean?

61
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,320
I'm not a friend

62
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
So I was in London this morning

63
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,320
And I was going between text messages with a p-dub in Florida

64
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,320
And figuring everything out in us in the Patricia

65
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,320
I think they call you or send you a text message

66
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,320
Can you make the show?

67
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,320
No, he didn't send

68
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,320
I see now I got one without any

69
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,320
Recognization

70
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,320
Oh, yeah

71
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,320
And then what you would typically ask me

72
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,320
How come people with unknown numbers?

73
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
Yeah, it was you then

74
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
It's the network then

75
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,320
And then you called me

76
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
Man, you are loud

77
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,320
Oh, I'm not in my ear

78
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,320
But you know what? I'm looking at you

79
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,320
I'm looking at you

80
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
I'm wearing your headphones

81
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Would you like your headphones

82
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,320
I chose in in San Francisco

83
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
Yes, but they're so good

84
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,320
That I just naturally

85
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
Yeah, would you like the headphones?

86
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
No, it's okay

87
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
So it's Friday afternoon

88
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
It is a beautiful day in the UK

89
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Yeah

90
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
It is the sun is shining

91
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,320
What is that?

92
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,320
It's close to eight degrees

93
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,320
You know what? I just said to Christina

94
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,320
When we went to the town center

95
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,320
Center for a while

96
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,320
I said, you know what?

97
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,320
This country is so beautiful

98
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Even with lousy weather

99
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
It's still very stunning

100
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,320
And juicy and beautiful when you look at it

101
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,320
And very green

102
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,320
But when the sunshine

103
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Then it's even better

104
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,320
It's so beautiful

105
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,320
Because that's exactly the first thing I was going to talk about

106
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,320
Is how fantastic

107
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,320
And how happy everybody is

108
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,320
Yeah, and the English people love it

109
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,320
And what they do

110
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,320
They take off a lot of clothes

111
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,320
Yes, they do

112
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,320
And let me tell you, in London it's

113
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,320
Boob heaven baby

114
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,320
It's like just wall the wall

115
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,320
Tids

116
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
Oh, I don't like toast

117
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,320
Well, the toast are coming out

118
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,320
And they have shorts on

119
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
You know?

120
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
Wow, I mean some awesome breasts

121
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,320
They are very thankful when this weather is so

122
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,320
It's funny because Christina said the same thing in her show

123
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,320
You know, we are now like the van

124
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,320
The van trap family

125
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,320
The van trap family of podcasting

126
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
She said the same thing

127
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,320
You can tell it's when it's summer

128
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,320
Everyone starts whipping off the clothes

129
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,320
Laying the grass and flashing their

130
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,320
Pasty white flesh towards satellites in outer space

131
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,320
Oh, they enjoy it so much

132
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
That's why they're having so much fun

133
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
When they're going on vacation

134
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,320
To Spain and to Tenerife

135
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,320
Oh boy, oh boy

136
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,320
Do they ever

137
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,320
Lends a lot of it

138
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,320
So it's been pretty much a week of

139
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Pod Show UK stuff

140
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,320
I've been in London twice

141
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,320
And it's been on the phone and back and forth

142
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,320
And it's been a great week

143
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,320
I'm so incredibly happy

144
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,320
With

145
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,320
Just the people that we've met

146
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,320
The connections you're making

147
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,320
The advertising community very excited

148
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,320
This morning we were at a

149
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,320
You mentioned that they work so differently from American people

150
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,320
You noticed when they come into the meeting

151
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,320
Showing their boobs first of all, which is kind of

152
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,320
You're like a flashing

153
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,320
Honestly, it's not so far

154
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,320
Not flashing but

155
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,320
So we had this meeting

156
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,320
In the city as we say

157
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Canary Warf

158
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,320
And there's really only one huge advertising agency there

159
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,320
And you had like senior partners and stuff

160
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,320
And it was just a three of us

161
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
Chris Daniel Winner who's a

162
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,320
You know managing director here in UK

163
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,320
You haven't even met him yet

164
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,320
I heard you like him

165
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,320
And typical agency people

166
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Kind of wacky and creative

167
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,320
And the senior partner came in had like an iPod hanging around

168
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
His neck and stuff

169
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,320
It was very

170
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,320
He moved around a lot

171
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
Bouncing around

172
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
And it was a bit hyper

173
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
You know there's a cute blonde girl who came in

174
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
And she had only a t-shirt on

175
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
And it was a little cold in the room

176
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
And it was like immediately it was like

177
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
Nipples

178
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
And of course, you're like, look straight in the eye

179
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
I'm going to look straight in her eye

180
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
I'm not going to look straight in her eye

181
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,320
I was like, oh my goodness

182
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
So that's how it feels

183
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
And it pulls in now

184
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
You're used to it

185
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
But it's a weird thing

186
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
It's nipples always

187
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
Always interesting

188
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
Always appealing

189
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
Nobody had a great meaning

190
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
It was very cool

191
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,320
And thank you everybody so incredibly much for

192
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
Telling me how to get there

193
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Yesterday on the show I said, what's the fastest way to get from

194
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Waterloo Station to

195
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
Well the Jubilee line of course

196
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,320
Eastbound?

197
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
You did?

198
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
It didn't even take a taxi

199
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Are you nuts that would have taken an hour and a half

200
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Now Canary Warf is like all the way on the east side

201
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
On the ground

202
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
Okay

203
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Yeah and it was great

204
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
It was 15 now it was actually a little bit about 20 minutes

205
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
It was fantastic

206
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
And I was quite proud of myself

207
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
As a London traveler

208
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
To be honest, yeah

209
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
And do you remember I told you this meeting came together

210
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Because of a Greek listener

211
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,320
Yeah, he told us

212
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
So he was there

213
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,320
He came in

214
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
Yeah, he apparently

215
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Of course

216
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
And the first question they always ask is what's her name?

217
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
Well it's a very Greek name pie

218
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,320
No, of course not

219
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,320
I mean that's what they always ask

220
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,320
What do you have to say?

221
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,320
Patricia

222
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Patricia Anglaya

223
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
That's a Greek part

224
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
Patricia Anglaya

225
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,320
Because also

226
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
Like a

227
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,320
Patrioti

228
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Yeah

229
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
No, what's a Patrioti

230
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Patrioti is somebody who lives in the same country

231
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,320
Or comes from the same country

232
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
So

233
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
That's Captain Dan

234
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Okay, for tomorrow

235
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
Well I hope everything's still on for tomorrow

236
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,320
Yeah

237
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,320
That's why check my mom is coming home from the hospital tomorrow morning

238
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
Oh

239
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Yeah

240
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
So we're right on time

241
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,320
Just about right on time

242
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,320
Because we'll be there probably probably an hour after she does

243
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
So that's good

244
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Very happy

245
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
She's out of the hospital

246
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,320
Patricia's going flying with us tomorrow

247
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320
Yes

248
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
How excited are you?

249
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
I

250
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
I'm sorry

251
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,320
I'm sorry

252
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
I like the flying

253
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
But if it's that long

254
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
It makes me very tired

255
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
The homing

256
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,320
It's an hour of 15 minutes

257
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
Uh-huh

258
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
Well you know

259
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,320
It's an hour of 15 minutes of homing

260
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
You don't like the homing?

261
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
What do you mean the homing?

262
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
Homing in my...

263
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
Yeah

264
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Excuse me

265
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
Is the same feeling of you

266
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,320
Remember we have to

267
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
If you sit on a washing machine

268
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,320
Yeah

269
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
Exactly

270
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
Yes, that's it

271
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,320
But also remember we had a little boat

272
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,320
We went to the canal

273
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320
Through the canal

274
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,320
And after a while you got so sleepy

275
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
From you know from the sound and the water

276
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
And everything

277
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,320
And it's a bit the same

278
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,320
Well we'll try not to fall asleep

279
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
While we're...

280
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
I always do you know

281
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
I know you're in the back

282
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,320
Like drooling

283
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,320
Yeah

284
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
See you guys captain Dan calling

285
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,320
On the other line

286
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
Oh

287
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
Yeah, well I'll have to call him back

288
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
And maybe your daughter is picking up

289
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
For this thing

290
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
Don't count on it

291
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Oh, no she picked up

292
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,320
She picked up

293
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
She picked up

294
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
She will come in

295
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,320
Yeah, let me just play this comment for a second

296
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
Hi Adam

297
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
This is Ed Stofel of FlyingReports.com

298
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
Speaking of pilots

299
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
Here's another pilot car

300
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
It's a blog and you convince me

301
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
I need audio content

302
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,320
So I'm working on the branding

303
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,320
To get up and running with a podcast there

304
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,320
But I do have a question for you

305
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Does podcasting

306
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
Will podcasting

307
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
Okay

308
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,320
For my flying habit

309
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
Will support my flying habit

310
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
That's what I want to know

311
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
Whenever you go flying

312
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,320
It's the equivalent of burning money in the air

313
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
So

314
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
So

315
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
No nothing

316
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Nothing will support your flying habit

317
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
I also wanted to respond to

318
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
One of the other callers

319
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Who said

320
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
He didn't favor Patricia being on the show

321
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
And here's my own analysis of that

322
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
I think Patricia has a mellowing influence

323
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
On you

324
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Maybe on the listeners too

325
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,320
So you're a bit more edgy when she isn't there

326
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
But mellowing is a good thing

327
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
So

328
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
You do whatever you want to do

329
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
Guy

330
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
And thanks a lot for the show

331
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,320
I'm going to continue to listen

332
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
And tell one's body

333
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
Tell one's body

334
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,320
What a man

335
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,320
Tell one's

336
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
Don't you love pilots

337
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
Don't pilot your sound great in general

338
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,320
Oh they do

339
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
Yeah

340
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
They do

341
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
And you know it's so important when you're in a plane

342
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
And you hear the captain's voice

343
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
And the voice sounds so good

344
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
You know so

345
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Trustful

346
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Uh-huh

347
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
And you think oh I'm good hands

348
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
I can't hear that

349
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
God what a man

350
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,320
I do remember once when I was very young

351
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,320
And we were in a

352
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
What's up

353
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,320
You don't have the immigration form for the flight

354
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
Tomorrow and you meant to have it

355
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
Twenty-four hours before

356
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
I sent it in yesterday

357
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
They said they don't have it

358
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,320
He talks so slow

359
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,320
So what did you do I need to call him back?

360
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,320
I don't know he says you have the form

361
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
And you know what to do

362
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
Oh okay well I sent it

363
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,320
I said facts that yesterday

364
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,320
The fact

365
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
I was like roll it up

366
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,320
Roll it up

367
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
Okay

368
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
I did do the immigration

369
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
But I guess sometimes

370
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
It's facts

371
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
I got it

372
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
I'll do it

373
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
It's facts technology man

374
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,320
Aviation is still based on facts

375
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,320
So how come they didn't receive it

376
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
I don't know

377
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,320
It's like maybe they have one phone line

378
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,320
At the tower where you send this off

379
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
And I guess sometimes a downloading porn at night

380
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
On the computer

381
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
The facts is don't come through

382
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
I don't know

383
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,320
It is

384
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
So yeah

385
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
I'm mellow you out a little bit

386
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,320
I guess so

387
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,320
It's true

388
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,320
I guess so

389
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,320
I'm leaving Tuesday

390
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,320
Honeybun

391
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
I know

392
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,320
Are you going to miss your boyfriend

393
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,320
I'm saying that because all the men

394
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
Don't worry

395
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,320
Roger Smalls will be here

396
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
You can count on it

397
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
He's going to show up with his brand new phone

398
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,320
And podcast from behind the trash bins

399
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
So what you got?

400
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Anything?

401
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,320
Well I went out with Christina

402
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,320
She wants to come with me

403
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,320
And

404
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Because

405
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
Wow did you call the newspaper?

406
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
Well

407
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
Always when she needs something

408
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,320
Of course

409
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,320
And I said what do you need

410
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
Need bigger bras

411
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
Yeah yeah yeah

412
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,320
Finally

413
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
Yeah

414
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,320
So they love that

415
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
They love to

416
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,320
To buy bigger bras

417
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
So that was a

418
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
That was a great day

419
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
And

420
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,320
And we went to the doctors this morning with her

421
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Because she gained a little bit of weight

422
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
From the pill

423
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
Because the kids

424
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,320
Especially that age

425
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
Do you realize that this will shock several many people?

426
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
No I think these

427
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
You know I

428
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
I'm a very

429
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
Sexy baby

430
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,320
No mother mom

431
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
And you're a milk

432
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
Sexy too

433
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
I hope so

434
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
And my daughter is very sexy

435
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
And she looks very beautiful

436
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
And men think she's older

437
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
Oh yeah

438
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,320
And though she had also some problems with her skin

439
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,320
And so

440
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,320
Talks about it with my sister

441
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,320
And she said well

442
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
You know Roxy

443
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Her daughter

444
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
And was actually

445
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Not sexual active

446
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
But she needed

447
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
Also somehow with some

448
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
With the hormones

449
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
And everything

450
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
With the hudders

451
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,320
Is that really

452
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
I mean is that

453
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
No no no no no no

454
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
For the hudders

455
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
But for skin

456
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,320
Skin

457
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,320
Especially

458
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
There is a big problem for them

459
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,320
The estrogen

460
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
Estrogen

461
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
More amount

462
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
Thing racing through their bodies

463
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
And it's not

464
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,320
It doesn't have a good effect on their skin

465
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
So we were talking about it

466
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,320
My sister

467
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,320
And me

468
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
And I

469
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
And

470
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,320
Me myself and I

471
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,320
Me myself and my sister

472
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
And

473
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
She said you know

474
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,320
It's maybe a very good idea

475
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
To put around a pill

476
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
Because

477
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,320
It's nice for protection

478
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,320
You never know what happens

479
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
Or you know

480
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
You never know

481
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,320
And also

482
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
It is

483
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
It's better for skin

484
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
For a whole body and everything

485
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
And she feels much better

486
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
I have to say

487
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
But then we have to figure out

488
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
What kind of pill is

489
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
Correct for her

490
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
This is an amazing process

491
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
That you have to go

492
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Yes

493
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
As a woman

494
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,320
Yes

495
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,320
Well no I have not tried the pill

496
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Not every pill suits you

497
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
They are pill for men

498
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,320
No there is no

499
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,320
No there isn't

500
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,320
One

501
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,320
A temporary

502
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,320
They try

503
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
They try all the time

504
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,320
But men don't want it

505
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,320
I take it

506
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
I'll take any

507
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,320
You got some pills

508
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,320
Maybe

509
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,320
You got some pills

510
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,320
You got some great pills

511
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,320
Yeah

512
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,320
The ones that start with the next

513
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,320
So we're trying out a couple of pills

514
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,320
And now she's got another one

515
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,320
Because this one

516
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,320
She gained weight

517
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,320
Listen to this

518
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,320
I mean four kilos

519
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,320
So

520
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
That's eight pounds

521
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,320
Eight pounds

522
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,320
Yeah

523
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,320
Wow

524
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,320
Actually nine pounds

525
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,320
Because our pounds are heavier

526
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,320
We're counting Dutch pounds

527
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,320
I think women's pounds are heavier in general

528
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,320
Anyway

529
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,320
But so the English and the American pounds are a little bit lighter

530
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,320
So say about nine pounds

531
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,320
In three weeks

532
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,320
That's a lot

533
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,320
And you know they don't want that

534
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
No of course not

535
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
That's all I hear

536
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,320
Yeah

537
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,320
So you know so we found it

538
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,320
It was so fun

539
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,320
I tried this one

540
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,320
I see what happens

541
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,320
So this was a woman talk

542
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
Yes

543
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
Well it was so funny the other day

544
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
The other evening

545
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
I think what Christina basically said is

546
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
Am I fat

547
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,320
And now all guys

548
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
No you know

549
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,320
Whenever you're

550
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,320
No matter what woman

551
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
No matter what your relationship

552
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,320
With a woman

553
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
If she says am I fat

554
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,320
No of course not

555
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
If my butt big no

556
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,320
I mean this is standard answer

557
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,320
Yes it is

558
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,320
But she will

559
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,320
She said yes it is

560
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,320
And I said no it isn't

561
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,320
Right

562
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,320
But then exactly

563
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,320
And that one

564
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,320
And it was amazing

565
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,320
Because there was yelling in the house

566
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,320
And I wasn't a part of it

567
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
It was kind of fun

568
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,320
Yeah

569
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,320
But you said it

570
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,320
And I said no I didn't

571
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,320
But it's my is my butt bigger

572
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,320
Yeah

573
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,320
A little bit

574
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,320
You said I'm fat

575
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,320
And then see you said I'm fat

576
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,320
No I didn't say you're fat

577
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,320
It was and it ended

578
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,320
Literally with two door slamming

579
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,320
One on the left

580
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
One on the left

581
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,320
My gosh

582
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
It's a sitcom

583
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,320
You know what

584
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,320
You were shivering

585
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,320
In the room here

586
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,320
I was

587
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
The dog

588
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,320
Was shivering that downstairs

589
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,320
The dog was like dude comes

590
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,320
It was me

591
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,320
Like me

592
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,320
In front of the door

593
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,320
Like me

594
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,320
Let me out

595
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
Let me out

596
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,320
Yeah

597
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,320
Okay but all is well

598
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
Back at the cottage

599
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
Everything is for me

600
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,320
I said mommy will figure it out

601
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,320
Everything

602
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
Hi Adam

603
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
Jamie here

604
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,320
Sorry about the background

605
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,320
I was just waiting for us to take me to town for two days

606
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,320
Just listening to the Charlie for I won

607
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,320
And I just had

608
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
As you mentioned the work

609
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
Jack

610
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,320
Which

611
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
I'm sure you meant to take charge

612
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,320
Pretty sure I can't be the only

613
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,320
You know the only one you came to figure stuff

614
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
But yeah

615
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,320
If you're really pleased with something

616
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,320
They need to say

617
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
You know you're really really tough

618
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
I have no idea what chapter is

619
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,320
But it's a town paper

620
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,320
Okay mate

621
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,320
Thank you

622
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,320
Right

623
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,320
Okay

624
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,320
So that was a little English lesson

625
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,320
I messed it up

626
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,320
I was trying

627
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
It's stuff slips in

628
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
And I was going to say

629
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
I was really happy about something

630
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
I meant to say I'm chuffed

631
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Yeah

632
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,320
But I said I'm chuffed

633
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,320
And which basically means

634
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,320
My legs have been rubbing together

635
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,320
And my crutches are red

636
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
Oh thank god that's nice

637
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
Oh and then we also went

638
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,320
To the house

639
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,320
Remember we had

640
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
Oh update on Patricia's palace

641
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,320
Oh yeah

642
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,320
Yeah

643
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
We were in the family of the house

644
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
We saw in Guilford

645
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,320
And so

646
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,320
So this house is listed on a monument list

647
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,320
It's grade two listed

648
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,320
Which means

649
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,320
Any structural

650
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,320
Changes you want to make

651
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
Has to be

652
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,320
Have to be approved by the local council

653
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,320
Yeah

654
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
And of course we have no experience with this

655
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,320
Partially fun

656
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,320
Fun

657
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,320
Imagine that

658
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,320
Fun to find out how that works

659
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,320
We talk to Mark Mark is

660
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,320
What is it

661
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,320
Contractor Mark

662
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,320
Contractor Mark

663
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
And we brought Mark along

664
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,320
And he said well

665
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,320
Normally it's not such a problem

666
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,320
Some people really understand it

667
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,320
Because if certain things

668
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
You have to live in

669
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,320
If you have to live in a house

670
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
Right now

671
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,320
And it's from

672
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
And it dates from

673
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
1900s or something

674
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
Yeah

675
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
1700 this house

676
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,320
17 and 18

677
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,320
17 and 1900

678
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
You need a little bit of adjustments

679
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
You know to make it more livable

680
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
And so he said

681
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
Will not be a problem

682
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
So after some email back and forth

683
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
And I already from the emails that came back from the council

684
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,320
I was like we'll see

685
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,320
And so we went there with Mark

686
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
And

687
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
And the first question was

688
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
Can we raise the doors

689
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,320
Well you know we have to say that

690
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,320
The lady came

691
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,320
That she was

692
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,320
Yeah the council

693
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
The council

694
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
And actually I was already like

695
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,320
Oh

696
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,320
It's a pity

697
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
It's a lady

698
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,320
Yeah because you know if it was a guy

699
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,320
Man we're a little bit better

700
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,320
Yeah

701
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,320
Yeah

702
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,320
I mean but she was so

703
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
Determined

704
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
She was not taking any of my advances

705
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
No

706
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,320
She was not impressed

707
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
I tried all my American jokes

708
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,320
Everything

709
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,320
And actually I started with a compliment

710
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,320
Because Mark said

711
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
I talked to her on the phone

712
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,320
And you know when we parked

713
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,320
And we saw her and she was in pink

714
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
Lovely lady

715
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,320
And she was around about

716
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,320
I think 45 I guess

717
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,320
Oh no man

718
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
She was much younger

719
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,320
Oh you think she was younger

720
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,320
Oh yeah I think she was younger

721
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,320
And Mark said what she sounded

722
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,320
Very nice

723
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,320
I'm very young

724
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,320
Yeah

725
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,320
And the moment I met her

726
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,320
I said hello

727
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
Hi I'm Patricia

728
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,320
She had it

729
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,320
Oh wow

730
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,320
Mark said

731
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
Did you sound like a little girl

732
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
You look like a young girl

733
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,320
Right

734
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,320
You looked like a young girl

735
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,320
I thought

736
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,320
Yeah

737
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
She proceeded to rip you a new asshole

738
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,320
About the house

739
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,320
It was like

740
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
And then right away

741
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,320
Let's go in

742
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,320
She didn't say anything

743
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,320
Just let's go in

744
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,320
So

745
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,320
It really was a nonstarter from from go

746
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,320
Yeah

747
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,320
It was like

748
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,320
So we started with the

749
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,320
Can we raise the door

750
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Six inches so my husband

751
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,320
Can actually walk in the house

752
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,320
I said otherwise

753
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
I have to change my husband

754
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,320
For sure

755
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,320
Right

756
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
Which still seems to be a viable option

757
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
And

758
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,320
You certainly have the experience

759
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,320
And changing husbands

760
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,320
Taking them back to the store

761
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
When you don't like them

762
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
It's such an asshole

763
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,320
The forums and all you know

764
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,320
So

765
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,320
And it was very interesting

766
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
Because she said

767
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,320
No, we can't do that

768
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,320
Because

769
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,320
And I know a little bit about this

770
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,320
The ratio of the doors

771
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
Will change

772
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,320
In

773
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,320
Relationship to the ratio of the panels

774
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,320
Now I know that you don't care

775
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,320
I know that you think it's horses

776
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,320
But from a

777
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,320
Architectural standpoint

778
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
This is the golden ratio

779
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
For broochio's numbers

780
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,320
I mean this is something

781
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
And actually

782
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
An architecture is important

783
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
But from that minute

784
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
I knew like I mean

785
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
I guess the knocking out of the walls

786
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,320
Upstairs

787
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,320
It's probably

788
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
You know they were very small

789
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
No they

790
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,320
What the doors

791
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,320
Yeah

792
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
They don't care

793
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,320
They do not care

794
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
They do not care

795
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,320
So that was one

796
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,320
I thought okay

797
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,320
That was one

798
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,320
That's one

799
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
Can always change the husband

800
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
No problem

801
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
So we started with

802
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,320
Well

803
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,320
There's some traffic here

804
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,320
So we thought about

805
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,320
Double glazing

806
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,320
No

807
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,320
No you cannot change

808
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,320
Because these are original winners

809
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,320
Yes but you know maybe

810
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,320
I actually can use them

811
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,320
I said can I wash the windows

812
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,320
Is that okay?

813
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,320
Yeah

814
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
At that point

815
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,320
At that point I knew we were going nowhere

816
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,320
And then you said

817
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,320
Well

818
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
And I gave her the look

819
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,320
You know what ladies and gentlemen

820
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
Or gentlemen

821
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
If you have a girlfriend or a wife

822
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
You know what the look is

823
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
And in this case

824
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,320
With Patricia's look

825
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,320
I actually had to look away

826
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,320
I actually stood in front of Mark

827
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,320
So he wouldn't get any of the look

828
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,320
Because that shit's deadly

829
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,320
That was very

830
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
And I thought okay

831
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320
It's all over

832
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,320
It's all over

833
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,320
Yeah

834
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,320
I thought you were going to go down

835
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,320
For a mud wrestle with her

836
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,320
We women know what the look is

837
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,320
On the one second

838
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,320
For those of you

839
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
Listening on the serious stars

840
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,320
102

841
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,320
It is Friday

842
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,320
Which means we've got

843
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,320
The scenes scene

844
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,320
Which at all

845
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,320
Rutherford coming up later on

846
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,320
Here on 102

847
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,320
Gilmore Daily Dawn and Drew East radio

848
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,320
And of course

849
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,320
Next

850
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,320
It is Mark Yoshimoto

851
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
Nemkov

852
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,320
Not just heading up pod show

853
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,320
But also with Pacific Coast

854
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,320
Hellway

855
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,320
You'll hear him in just minutes from now

856
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,320
And we didn't even

857
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,320
Came to knocking out

858
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,320
Some walls

859
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,320
No

860
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,320
That was it

861
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
No

862
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,320
And you said

863
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
Patricia

864
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,320
Is there anything else you want to ask

865
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
I'm done

866
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
I'm done

867
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,320
And I gave it a look

868
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
And I was gone

869
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,320
So you know

870
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,320
That was it

871
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,320
What's my dream

872
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,320
Sorry

873
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,320
The problem is

874
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,320
We really like Gilford

875
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,320
And by the way

876
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,320
Thank you for forcing me to come here

877
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
Yeah

878
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,320
I do appreciate it

879
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
Very special

880
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,320
It is

881
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,320
The architecture of Gilford in general

882
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
Is brown and ugly

883
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,320
So that is kind of an issue

884
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,320
This is why Patricia liked the horny castle so much

885
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,320
Because it had the facade

886
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
In front of a brown

887
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,320
She had house like the rest

888
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,320
But we can use the power of the source code

889
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,320
If anyone knows of a house

890
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,320
In Gilford

891
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,320
And you know enough about

892
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
A little bit of glamour

893
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,320
And you can have a poopy brown roof

894
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,320
It's open up the possibilities

895
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,320
It doesn't matter

896
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,320
You know we're in the market

897
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
It does a Victorian look

898
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
We need to jump on the property ladder

899
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
Yes we want to

900
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,320
We would love to

901
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,320
You know and I have a good taste

902
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
I have a good taste

903
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,320
I make it beautiful

904
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,320
I adjust to the outside

905
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,320
I will

906
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
You know who you coming out to

907
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,320
No

908
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,320
The council doesn't care

909
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,320
Or do you put flowers outside or not

910
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,320
They don't care

911
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
Because we love a beautiful old

912
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
Historian building

913
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
We do love that

914
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
The style I do not like

915
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,320
I'm a little tired

916
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,320
Of course

917
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,320
I'm tired of the bathrooms

918
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,320
And the doors

919
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,320
Oh man

920
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,320
No

921
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,320
But we'll find something

922
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,320
Because you know there are some beautiful

923
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,320
I think some beautiful houses here

924
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,320
I've seen them

925
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,320
Absolutely

926
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,320
So that was it

927
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,320
Okay

928
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,320
And tomorrow we get it really early

929
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,320
Yep

930
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,320
Yeah

931
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,320
Okay

932
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,320
But I don't really have anything else

933
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,320
I figured

934
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,320
Now that's my phone

935
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,320
I thought I heard a fly

936
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,320
Now this is my fly

937
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,320
Here

938
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,320
Wait

939
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
See now I'm getting a phone show

940
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,320
We need to go away

941
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
I can't do anything

942
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,320
That Steve Gilmore

943
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,320
He wants me to do the show with him

944
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,320
I should do it

945
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,320
So we had a lovely dinner yesterday

946
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,320
All right

947
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,320
Hey Steve

948
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,320
Hey

949
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,320
I'm doing the show right now

950
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,320
I'll call you back about 15

951
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,320
And we'll do it today

952
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,320
Okay

953
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,320
All right

954
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,320
Bye

955
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
Sorry

956
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,320
So we had a lovely dinner

957
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,320
Yesterday in Cafe de Paris

958
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,320
That was wonderful

959
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,320
Sitting outside

960
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,320
Isn't it lovely when you can sit outside

961
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
Until very late

962
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,320
Yes

963
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
You know

964
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,320
And I even drank some wine

965
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
It was so cool

966
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
It was so cool

967
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
Because

968
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
I said

969
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,320
You know and this is a real

970
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
Real French people in a real French restaurant

971
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
I would kind of wine

972
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
Would you like

973
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
And I'm looking at it

974
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,320
Do you have anything with a screw top

975
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,320
Because that's kind of my wife likes the most

976
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,320
And I swear to God

977
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,320
The guy brought a bottle

978
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,320
By the way

979
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
A 16 pound bottle of wine

980
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,320
Where the screw top

981
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,320
Yeah

982
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,320
Some light

983
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,320
You know

984
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,320
Very light

985
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
Not very interesting

986
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,320
Wine

987
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,320
Yeah

988
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,320
So like that

989
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,320
Patricia's manager

990
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,320
From 18,000 years ago

991
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,320
John Forcalfaic came over

992
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,320
And we talked about something

993
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,320
For a long time

994
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,320
You were one and only manager

995
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,320
You know

996
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,320
It was unfortunately

997
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,320
That he came before

998
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
You know

999
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,320
Just as I'd already finished the show

1000
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,320
Because I really want to ask him

1001
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,320
About the UFO story

1002
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
That you guys claim that you saw you

1003
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,320
Absolutely

1004
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,320
Now that would have been fun

1005
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,320
Yeah

1006
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,320
And we'll do another time

1007
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,320
Just some house cleaning stuff

1008
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
A lot of people confused about the

1009
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,320
Feed for the show

1010
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,320
The podcast feed

1011
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,320
It's the official one

1012
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Is it DailySourceco.com

1013
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,320
If you subscribe through curry.com

1014
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
You could be disappointed

1015
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,320
Or surprised

1016
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,320
Because you may or may not get the show

1017
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
And you may get other shows

1018
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,320
And so the official feed

1019
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,320
Is DailySourceco.com

1020
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,320
Seems to be a lot of confusion about that

1021
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,320
And something else I was supposed to say

1022
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,320
I don't know

1023
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,320
I can't remember

1024
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,320
It's warm

1025
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,320
You started very early

1026
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,320
It started very early

1027
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,320
It started very early

1028
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,320
But it was so nice

1029
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,320
It's so nice to just hop on that train

1030
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,320
Hop on the two

1031
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,320
Have a meeting

1032
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,320
Look at the boobies

1033
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,320
Come on home

1034
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,320
Honey von

1035
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,320
I'm flabbergasted

1036
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,320
You flabbergasted

1037
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,320
I'm flabbergasted

1038
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,320
I'm flabbergasted

1039
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,320
Alright

1040
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
I'm not going to tell you who this is

1041
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,320
So you listen to it

1042
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,320
Tell me what you think

1043
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,320
After words

1044
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,320
Roller

1045
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Do the guessing

1046
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
Re-touch me

1047
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,320
You're my town

1048
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,320
And I'm home

1049
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
You're like hell

1050
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,320
Can't find a phone

1051
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,320
You're myself

1052
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,320
Any last words

1053
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
Thinking I need help

1054
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,320
But no one I want yet

1055
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,320
We touch me

1056
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,320
And I'm perfect

1057
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,320
Follow me

1058
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
With you

1059
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
We touch me

1060
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,320
Can't find a phone

1061
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,320
We are over

1062
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,320
Forever

1063
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,320
We're over

1064
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,320

We're over

1067
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,320
We're over

1068
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,920
Oh my die

1069
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,320
You're my town

1070
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,320
And I'm flabbergasted

1071
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,320
We're here

1072
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,320
We're in a safe house

1073
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:31,320
We've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed here, we've passed

1075
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:30,320
I can't find what I really want Never find I could be your valentine

1076
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:48,320
I can't find what I really want Never find I could be your valentine

1077
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
Reach out to me

1078
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,320
Why is it that Debbie Harry meets Samantha Fox or something?

1079
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
Yeah, okay

1080
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,320
Well first of all the sound that you heard you know part of that is is my sound you know, so

1081
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,320
Musicians hate my sound because it makes your record sound different. Yeah, a lot of compression

1082
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,320
You know, no, it does not crap. It's a compression

1083
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
Is it Leslie Gord?

1084
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,320
No, no, no, no. I agree with you was kind of a blondie vibe. Yeah

1085
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,320
It's Kathy Valentine who was in the go-goes

1086
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,320
Really?

1087
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
Yeah, she's on the podcast music network

1088
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,320
Oh, yeah, you told me that

1089
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,320
I'm telling you what I'm seeing now. We're just going to see more and more and more

1090
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,320
I have to say she's coming

1091
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,320
Her voice sounds better than

1092
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,320
Bullinda Carlisle

1093
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,320
Oh, baby

1094
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1095
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,320
Well, everybody sounds better than

1096
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,320
Bullinda Carlisle

1097
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,320
Okay, dokey

1098
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,320
Alright, baby

1099
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,320
I'm trying to facts the airport and that's not working

1100
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,320
So let's just cut the show

1101
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,320
Alright

1102
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,320
And maybe maybe you'll show it in the Monday because Tuesday I'm gone

1103
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,320
So that'll be the last show together for a while

1104
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,320
Alright
