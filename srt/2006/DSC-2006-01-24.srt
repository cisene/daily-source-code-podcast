1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Delta Sierra Charlie, 3-2-2.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped my ass.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
3-2s?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We don't need lost, thinking crazy.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I like to think I'm flying into this journey.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh, fantastic.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's so curry.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I don't know if it's the resurrection of Jimmy.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But it will definitely put you in the mood for today.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's Tuesday, Daily Source Co.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
From the curry cottage.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Set the next on fire then.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Mother, dream, destiny.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Life's so bright, you can't see.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You go to the window, I'll see the students and we'll all go.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So good, can't be real, terrible.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You can't be real, you can't be real, you can't be real.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You stop so knowledge.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And say no to me.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Could I clean the rest of this?

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I don't see.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So God knows it all.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
From your faith, we've got a sunshine with God.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He's cooking.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We've got his cooking.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We've been running to live the madness, stay blessed.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I said this, always be so much to see.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And give me the talent to feel good,

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
stay blessed.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And give me the confidence to be worthy.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And give me the confidence to be worthy.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So good, can't be real, you can't be real.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And give me the confidence to be worthy.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So good, can't be real, you can't be real.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You go to the window, I'll see the students and we'll follow.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,400
I don't say hope, but I don't think we've got a sunshine

38
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:28,000
Well done, it's good to hear you, it's awesome to hear you

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's awesome to hear you, it's awesome to hear you

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's awesome to hear you, it's awesome to hear you

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's awesome to hear you, it's awesome to hear you

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's awesome to hear you, it's awesome to hear you

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,920
Cool to hear you,OS, feel so deaf

44
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,560
Girl tell me, that's awesome

45
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,620
Girl tell me, we're gonna sunshine

46
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,640
Well done, we're gonna attend

47
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:26,080
Oh man, the substitutes got his cocaine, not an endorsement of the drug, which by the way

48
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,960
I've never done in my entire life, can you believe that?

49
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,720
All the rock and roll showbiz I've been a part of, it's never even been offered to me.

50
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,200
That's right, that's actually something that when you think about it, maybe it's interesting,

51
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,280
maybe it's strange to you, but I've never swallowed anything, never snorted anything, never

52
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:52,560
injected anything, and it really never had any, any, any need to, but honestly, I don't drink

53
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,240
either, but we all know what I do do in my spare time.

54
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,560
Hey, everybody, how are you doing? It's Tuesday. Come to you from Curry Cottage. This is the

55
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,920
Daily Source Code. It's a big audio feedback today on the show, plenty of cool comments that

56
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,560
came in, including one from our friend, comic strip blogger. If you've never, or if you'd like

57
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:19,200
to put a voice to the interesting and varied postings that he puts on my Curry.com web

58
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,960
blog, then stay tuned for that update. Well, first of all, I want to thank everybody for all the

59
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:32,080
beautiful thoughts and prayers and poems, and just words of inspiration about the passing of

60
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,760
Jessie are beautiful, beautiful. By the way, I don't think I told you she's a mixed breed,

61
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,080
she was a mixed breed of golden retriever and German shepherd, just beautiful.

62
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,920
And today, this glossy magazine, this beautiful photo shoot, this series that Patricia did for

63
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,920
a magazine called Beaumont, which, of course, is like a fashion magazine. One of the pictures

64
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:04,800
is Patricia on the downs, just looking fabulous with a, you know, with a white like Russian hat and

65
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,440
a faux fur coat, and that she has a swubber, who's our little Yorkie, who

66
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,200
barks for three, as you heard yesterday on the show, and Jessie, the last picture of her alive.

67
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,160
As just kind of heart-wrenching, but thank you very much. It's, it's much appreciated and I've

68
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,600
been sharing all of those with Patricia and Christina as well. Thanks. Legal update. Um,

69
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,320
yesterday, of course, after I'd already done the show, the publisher of the magazine that

70
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,880
published the stolen pictures stolen because they were taken from Flickr from my account on Flickr,

71
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:49,120
which clearly states they're available there under the, uh, attribution, non-commercial share,

72
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,200
or like license. Uh, so these guys, apparently, are a little worried about taking this to court.

73
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,280
So they said, oh, well, let's try and settle out of court. Uh, we'll do is we'll place a

74
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:07,520
retraction and an apology on page four, and we'll pay you 1,500 euros. Which is about, uh,

75
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,520
what was that? That's like, uh, 1750 bucks or something like that. It's not about the money you

76
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:20,640
you guys. Um, what is very interesting, though, the, the apology that they said that they would publish

77
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:27,360
along with the, you know, if we accepted their, um, their settlement basically says, and I'm just

78
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,640
paraphrasing the translation here. Uh, we published pictures that we had no rights to publish. We

79
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:40,640
apologize to the curry family. Hold on, that's my blackberry still. Which, of course, is, uh,

80
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:46,640
is true. Uh, but, you know, that, that is not going to get you out of this. I mean, no way. No way.

81
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,520
What's interesting, though, is that they said, well, um, even though, um, you, you might have

82
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,200
to consider our offer. We're still going to publish the apology. So they're basically already

83
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,800
admitting guilt, which is really smart guys. But I'm holding out, not from money. I'm not holding

84
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,360
out from money. I'm holding out so that we have proof that you did something wrong and that we have

85
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,840
your spruedance and we can use that moving forward. And then, of course, there's a whole child

86
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,000
endangerment thing, which is when I'm really, really emotional about, um, although I, uh, knowing the

87
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,360
Dutch court system, again, this is a court system that does not have a jury. They have a professional

88
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,680
judge system. And judges will decide the case. And what's interesting is because the court

89
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,600
system is so overloaded when they run out of judges, they hire lawyers to become back of judges.

90
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,560
It's a fucked up stupid system. It really is. But this time, I do have the law on my side.

91
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,240
Certainly, when it comes to the pictures, the endangerment of a child piece, I think that's open to

92
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,160
interpretation by a by a judge. Because, you know, obviously, when you're a celebrity, then,

93
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,520
different rules adhere. And if you don't think it's true, do you just have to take my word for it?

94
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,200
Actually, there's an audio comment that came in that talks about just as very topic

95
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,600
from a podcasting perspective. And I wanted to start off with that today. Because it's something,

96
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,040
uh, it's a topic that is, uh, of interest to me. And I think that you'll find it interesting as well.

97
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:22,480
Listen to the comment first. Hey, Adam, this is Cory from sportshawks.com. That's SPORTS HAAWKS.com.

98
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:29,280
I wanted to comment about something that I've noticed in the podcasting community to start off.

99
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,160
And I've heard a lot of this over the last couple of weeks. People have been talking about podcast

100
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:41,600
there's a celebrities. And I can understand that. And I, to, I agree with them to a certain extent.

101
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,040
But I think that we are a better kind of celebrity than a Tom Cruise or someone of that nature is.

102
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,800
You know, we have this movement that's revolutionizing the media industry. If not the world,

103
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,880
we're getting all this exposure, even if the BBC still thinks it's recently or suddenly.

104
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:06,320
We have thousands of listeners subscribe to our shows going to the websites and downloading the MP3s.

105
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,120
But we're still ordinary people. And I really think that there's more to that.

106
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,560
You know, while we enjoy the success, we shouldn't forget where we started out. Us podcasters,

107
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,280
checking out the latest software, trying to, you know, scratch together some kind of show,

108
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:31,280
figuring out how to upload your audio files and host them, having all these problems with RSS feeds and XML.

109
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,320
And you know, it was very humble beginnings. So I think that the podcast is really

110
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,960
need to remember that we are not better than anyone else. We're still regular people.

111
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,440
And we should try to stay in glove with our listeners as much as possible by playing audio

112
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,680
comments or responding to emails, something, right? But staying connected and in touch with our fans

113
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,400
is probably one of the most important parts of podcasting. One quick thing before I go,

114
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,640
I've also noticed the camaraderie, if you will, within the podcast and community.

115
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,240
Really what it is, just everyone willing to help each other out. Pods say for pieces,

116
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,480
an example. Another one is something that I'm currently in the middle of.

117
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,680
You know, Kevin Reeves, the recording artist, two things, the song shine. Believe you played him about

118
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,000
a month ago. Kevin and I started talking, right? And now both of us,

119
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:27,040
okay, so mostly Kevin really, working on a theme song for Sports Hawks Radio. That's the show

120
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,840
produced by SportsHawks.com. And I just wanted to say that I think it's awesome how this community

121
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,600
of podcasters works together to, you know, to do any kind of projects. And just it's great. I love it.

122
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,280
I'll send you a promo in about a week or so. Peace.

123
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,640
All right, man, looking forward to the promo. And thank you very much for opening this

124
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,760
conversation, this topic of discussion. Because, and I'm obviously speaking from my own personal

125
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,480
experience here, I've been a, and I'll just say, quote, celebrity in Europe, have been a celebrity

126
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,920
in the United States. And I would venture to say, I'm a celebrity in podcasting. What's interesting

127
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,600
is that the, and this, I've witnessed this all throughout my life. What people always will say

128
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,440
is that it is the celebrity that has changed and doesn't care about their audience anymore.

129
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:19,600
This is just not true. What happens is exactly the opposite. The people around you change that

130
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:27,760
attitude towards you. By the way, celebrity from the dictionary.com, a famous person or

131
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:35,360
renowned fame, celebrity hood, synonym celebrity hero, luminary, name, notable, personage.

132
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,800
These nouns refer to a widely known person, the social celebrity heroes of science,

133
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,520
the theatrical luminary, big name and sports, notable of the constant stage of personage in the

134
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,560
field of philosophy. And so, well, let's take Tom Cruise as an example.

135
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,840
I can only imagine what this guy goes through. I don't know him personally. I can only imagine

136
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,080
what he goes through. If you just open up any magazine, open up any newspaper,

137
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:09,840
listen to anyone who talks about movies or actors, and they piss on him. Nine times out of ten,

138
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:16,240
because when you get really big and you get quote fame or celebrity, which I guess is because

139
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,000
you are celebrated for doing something interesting or good or being a hero, as they say here,

140
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,880
or social celebrity, that's when it all starts. At first, it's like, hey, go, man, that's great.

141
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,080
And then you are over-analyzed in anything you do. And what happens is people start to project.

142
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,680
And this is actually something that I learned from the podcast InsightWorks, where people start

143
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:46,880
to cast their own shadow over you. And if you go ahead and look at podcast alley or any other

144
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,520
forum or lots of postings around the internet about podcasting, there's a lot of negativity,

145
00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:00,960
a lot of bad vibes, particularly directed towards me. And although I understand why people do this,

146
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:07,360
I think I understand the philosophy, it is not the celebrities who lose touch with their fanbase.

147
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,360
The fanbase usually grows so big that you can't just handle it anymore.

148
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,760
You know, and so what some people do is they get a secretary to read through the email.

149
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,480
And people actually suppose that. You know, say, oh, well, he probably doesn't read his own email,

150
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,800
and someone else is doing that for doesn't care about the fans. It's, it's, you have no idea

151
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,080
what goes on. You really don't. And a lot of this stuff is really hurtful. Particularly if you're

152
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,040
still trying to do the same thing that you set out to do when you started your career, whether it's

153
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,600
in writing or acting or movies or podcasting or music or whatever it is. You know, look at Madonna,

154
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,880
do you think it's nice to read what they write about her, about her body, about her family, about her life?

155
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,400
You know, what happens actually, I think is that the fanbase usually just starts to alienate

156
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:03,280
the celebrity. Now, of course, this is something that I believe is embedded in human nature.

157
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,040
So I can't take, I don't take it personally. I can't hold any responsible, and anybody

158
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:18,080
responsible for for what happens. But it really is something that just happens over and over and

159
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:24,000
over and again, and I've had multiple careers in different forms of entertainment, different forms of

160
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
business, and it is just unbelievable what people will write, what they'll, you know, the conspiracy

161
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,600
theories, it's, you know, and you actually set this up very interestingly with your comment,

162
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,760
you know, like we've got a nice little community. And then what happens is when someone

163
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,880
rises up above that community, could chunk, it's time the chopper's head off. And

164
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:50,480
oh, man. Oh, wait, like Barry, don't do that. Wow, these new, so I got the new

165
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,920
bottle model blackberry, which is the, what is it? This 7900 something. It seems to be even worse

166
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:03,920
with disturbance on equipment than the previous one. And this stuff is very difficult to explain

167
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,360
if you haven't witnessed it firsthand. You really, you really don't know what it's like.

168
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:17,680
So I think that you might want to take a look inside yourself. And sure, people do wacky shit.

169
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,680
You know, Tom Cruise jumping up and down on the couch in front of Oprah is pretty fucking wacky,

170
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,320
but you know what, it was frustration. Here's a guy who has just been beaten to a pulp.

171
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:33,760
People are rude to him and look, and again, I don't know him, but I see what happens. And I do

172
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:39,040
feel bad for him. And just open up any gossip magazine. Yeah, it's really funny. It's very funny.

173
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,160
It's funny to make little puns and make jokes or come up with conspiracy theories about what they're

174
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,440
doing. But when it's you, it's not so funny. Particularly when you're like, hey, dude, I didn't

175
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:56,080
change anything. This is just how I am. And you know, people start to microanalyze and scrutinize

176
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:03,600
everything you do. So look at yourself first before you start to say that a celebrity has

177
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,360
gone off the scale or jump the shark or off his rocker. Dude, I'm still the same guy,

178
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,720
sitting the same freaking cottage. In fact, I downgraded from a castle to a cottage. Just trying

179
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,320
to make things happen. Just trying to make things work. And we're getting pretty close to sharing

180
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:25,680
a lot of that love with the podcasting community. Um, to anyway, take a look inside yourself

181
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:32,720
before you start to project onto celebrities in any field of expertise. Let's move on. Shall we?

182
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,000
Don't want to get depressed or anything. What's this from the School of Podcasting?

183
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,520
Hey, Adam. This is Dave Jackson from the School of Podcasting.com and the Musicians Cooler.

184
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,680
Got a quick creative commons question for you. Realize that you're going to probably turn into

185
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,440
the creative commons genius here in the near future. And if with all the different options available

186
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,440
to podcasts, just now to have advertising in their podcast, is that then officially make them a

187
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:03,440
commercial podcast. And if so, does that then stop them from playing music from the podcast

188
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,000
safe music network, realizing that some of that creative commons licensing may have some issues

189
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,720
with commercial podcasts. So as we all plan for the future, and we all started thinking about

190
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,520
adding advertising to our podcast, is that something that's going to kind of screw things up

191
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,040
with playing podcast safe music. Love the daily source code. And I wish you all the best of luck

192
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,440
with your court case, and I really hope you stick it to those bastards. See you later, Adam.

193
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:35,520
Thank you. Okay. So just to reiterate, the term pod safe music, which was coined during a,

194
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,760
as far as I can recall, I got to be so careful about saying this stuff. As far as I can recall,

195
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,920
during a trade secrets with Dave Winner, myself, we came up with the concept of pod safe music.

196
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,440
That's, it's a pretty broad concept. Essentially, it means that you've received permission to

197
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,880
play this and all fees associated with broadcast or performance rights or synchronization rights,

198
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,680
or what have you have been waived. So whether you have creative commons, whether,

199
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,080
well, I can only really speak for the, for the situation in the United States, because the

200
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,400
ASCAD BMI definitely works differently than in other countries, particularly in Europe.

201
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,320
But as a copyright owner, if you own the copyrights to your work, you can determine whatever you want.

202
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,280
You can write a license to the daily source code that says you have to pay a thousand dollars per

203
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,440
each time you, you play a song and you can give it away free for someone else. It's up to you.

204
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,720
It's your property. You know, that's what it's about. Copyright is your property.

205
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,000
Now, you can license a piece of work under different licenses for different people. That's very,

206
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,400
very normal. So if you have a creative commons license, and that would conflict with being played

207
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,800
in a podcast that is commercial by nature or has a commercial zenith, then the creative

208
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,280
commons license that you choose, if you had for instance a non-commercial creative license,

209
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,000
well, then it could not be used. Now, the difference here is on the podcast music network,

210
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,280
music.podshow.com. When you sign up as an artist, you are basically creating a new specific

211
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,520
license for other podcasts that are registered on the system. And it makes no difference whether

212
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,280
they're commercial or not, the license means they can play your stuff as long as they

213
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,280
report it back into the network. And by the way, as we're moving forward on development,

214
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,640
that reporting process is going to become automatic. So you won't have to think about it anymore.

215
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,800
You can just play it. You can actually mix it, mash it. If all goes according to plan,

216
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,640
it'll still show up as played in the podcast music network, which also means, and I'm hoping,

217
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,040
and we've got the George the Russian scientist working on this stuff, that if you were to use a

218
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,800
little piece of music to mix it into a promo or something, that it would also would be

219
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,200
accredited at the podcast music network. That's some of the technology behind it all that we hope

220
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,600
to be coming out with soon. And we will be talking more about the podcast music network and pricing,

221
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,480
since I didn't get to that yesterday when Patricia walked in. But you know what, I don't mind,

222
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,680
she walked in, you know, came on the show, it's cool. Aloha from Mikey Key Adam. This is Kurt

223
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,320
from the digital slot pod at digitalslob.com. Look, I know you've got to be busy right now,

224
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,320
but I just wanted to bring up something that's surely occurred to you, but maybe not all of your listeners.

225
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,080
And that is that there is a large fraction of people out there who don't listen to podcasts with an iPod,

226
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:24,880
or even an MP3 player, like me, for example. Sure, I mean, I give my iPod some fresh air every now and then,

227
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,160
but probably 50 to 60% of the time I'm listening on my I'm hacking my comfy chair.

228
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,600
As a digital slot, I've really got to have a good reason to leave my comfy chair. Anyway,

229
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,160
I've got this my space page and many of my friends email me saying, hey, Kurt, I'd listen to your show,

230
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,880
but I don't have an iPod yet. So it seems like dozens of times I've had to email them,

231
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,360
telling them that their computer isn't MP3 player. I think there's still a big education task out there ahead of us.

232
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,440
I know Rob over at podcast 411 has been doing a lot to educate the potential

233
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,480
podcasting, listening populace out there. And no matter how many listeners you've got now,

234
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,800
you're kidding yourself if you think everybody out there knows what the hell is going on in the podcasting world.

235
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,320
But I just wanted it to suggest, I know I'm preaching to the converted here,

236
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,120
but I just wanted it to suggest that all podcasters and podcasting listeners for that matter,

237
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,160
spread the word that basically, you know, you don't need a fly to kill a fly swatter.

238
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,560
You don't need a sponge to make a sponge cake, and you don't need an iPod to hear a podcast.

239
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,720
Just a kind public service suggestion from your friendly neighborhood digital slot.

240
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,720
Mahalo Adam and Aloha.

241
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,480
Aloha, my friend. Aloha to you too.

242
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,160
Absolutely right. And we do need to do a lot of work on that.

243
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,840
I have heard so many times. I don't have an iPod, so I don't think I can get podcast.

244
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,760
Yes, you're very right about that. That is, of course, the drawback to the name,

245
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,480
which on the other hand got us a lot of traction. And we definitely, you know,

246
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,640
lead stuff of the iPod to get that traction. So, and let's be honest, the majority of portable

247
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,760
players that are marketed as portable players, I'm talking about cell phones, are of course iPods.

248
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,400
But yes, this is a big part of what we're doing with at pod show.

249
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,880
When we start our campaign, which as soon as the PDN is launched and we're getting people into

250
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,360
the network, then we're going to go on our 100 million listener march. And a big part of it is

251
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:18,080
saying, come over here, enjoy podcasts. We're not going to put the RSS, you know, stuff up at the top.

252
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,640
In fact, if you look at what's going on in podcasting online, a lot of what you're seeing

253
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,880
is geared specifically towards the podcast community. And I think there's a very different way to

254
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,240
look at a show site. It shouldn't necessarily have to be a weblog. It is by default from

255
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,320
many people because it easily creates the required RSS feed. But we're going to, we've actually

256
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,160
done quite a lot of work on trying to make this as easy as possible. And really to get the

257
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,480
listeners involved, give them tools so that they can get involved with their podcasts, promote their

258
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:57,440
favorite podcasts. And also, talk amongst themselves. And that will be a part of what we're launching

259
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,800
a couple of products. Of course, we have the pod show delivery network. We have pod show plus,

260
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,960
and we have my pod show. Ah, is there enough pod show in there? I think so. So be on the look out

261
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,600
for that. And indeed, make sure, if you just tell one person, they're going to tell someone else.

262
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:18,160
If you turn one person on a podcasting, and you'd be amazed how many really smart people just

263
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,640
don't understand it and can't parse the information of what a podcast is. How do I listen to it?

264
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,920
And that definitely is up to us. So if you're listening to this before, um, you hear that my

265
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:36,480
Dutch slept in. Eccrepted. I was going to say, if you are, for instance, listening to this show

266
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,040
on serious satellite stars 103, and you want to know more about podcasting, and you don't have

267
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:46,000
an iPod, no worries, because you can just go to any computer, or you can go to podshow.com.

268
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,760
If you want to go to this show, go to dailysourcecode.com. You can click on the link where it actually

269
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,760
says direct link to the show, and you can listen to it right there on your computer. You can download

270
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:59,200
that. You can burn it onto a CD. Um, you could email that to someone. You could file share it. I mean,

271
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:07,760
all of that is completely cool. And that is what podcasting offers in its consumption mechanisms.

272
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,200
Speaking of those very same people who are checking us out on the serious satellite stars 103,

273
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,320
one channel over from Howard Stern these days. Um, the satellite windows closing up next will be

274
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,640
Pacific Coast Hillway followed by Madge Weinstein, and of course followed by Donor Drew. And I'll

275
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,960
talk to you guys tomorrow for the hump day edition of your Delta Sierra Charlie.

276
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,880
I got this great countdown timer called Countdown Clock. I'm running it on the, uh, on the

277
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,480
PC, where I use cast blaster these days. And that's the default sound when your timer is up. I thought

278
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,840
it was just now. I hope it's part safe, by the way. Hi, I don't carry. Here is comics trip

279
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:55,760
blogger, and I would like to ask you two questions. First, uh, when approximately this podcast

280
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:02,400
delivery network will be starting, I'm interested in it, and I presumed that a lot of other people

281
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:10,880
are interested. Second question, what does Shiba model have you purchased? I also have Toshiba

282
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:17,840
not book. I have tablet PC, but probably you don't have tablet PC. So what Toshiba model

283
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,720
have you purchased? I am just interested. Thank you. Bye. There he is, ladies and gentlemen.

284
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,720
The illustrious comic strip blogger, who, um, depending on his mood, has something interesting to

285
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:35,920
say, or something interesting to say in a very fall way. Comics strip blogger, uh, the podcast delivery

286
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:42,800
network. Um, well, it's going into beta. Uh, I believe this week, as we signed up a whole bunch

287
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:50,240
of podcasters. Uh, well, actually, we, we made an offer, uh, and most of them signed up, which, uh,

288
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,440
I met with just as many people as I could at the portable media expo. And, uh, internally, we call

289
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,600
these people the super 30 or the data 30 or whatever you want to call them, but they know that they're

290
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:05,840
coming in to try out this new system. Of course, the delivery network part, um, uh, is crucial.

291
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,840
And we spent months and months working on, uh, on getting the right partner in for that, um,

292
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,000
to, you know, so we just don't want to go through any of the, you know, if you get successful

293
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,520
and this, this stuff really works and we got a hundred million listeners coming in and we got

294
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,760
stuff rocking and rolling. We don't want bandwidth and scalability issues to be a problem. Um,

295
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,080
so that part we saw. That's, that really took the longest and, uh, these first podcasters who

296
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,320
were joining the network will come in and they're going to help us figure it out. I don't think

297
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:43,520
it'll take very long, uh, after that before we start letting more podcasters come in, um, and,

298
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,400
you know, of course, with that comes, uh, comes the offering. Um, and it will be free.

299
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,920
I just want to reiterate that free. They'll be the different levels of what you can do with, uh,

300
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,640
with podshow. Because we've noted me, you know, we've never made any, uh, any secret that we're about

301
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,040
helping you make money, helping us make money, and actually helping your listeners make money as well.

302
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,280
So look for that, uh, look for some beta reports to be out in the next week or so. And, uh,

303
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:16,000
you know, we're not going to probably open the door wide open for everyone to come rushing in.

304
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,120
We, we still want to scale this up, uh, carefully. Um, so there will be, uh, I don't know if we're

305
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,960
going to do, um, you know, like open the door for 100 people at our time, or the invite system is

306
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,040
one way, but that's not, that really doesn't help you with scalability. That's just kind of like the

307
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,960
hype it up. I don't think we need to do that. Um, and the second question, come extra blogger,

308
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:46,400
I have the, uh, podj, what is this? R205-s209? Is that it? No, this is making me sense. Let me see,

309
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:53,520
is that I'm marking on it? It is the 205 series. It's the one that comes with an external, uh,

310
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,560
CD DVD, uh, reader and burner. The thing weighs nothing, it weighs like, you know, less than a pound.

311
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:03,600
It's the thinnest notebook I've ever had in my hands. Um, but I really enjoyed, has super long

312
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,360
battery life. So if I needed to do something in a pinch on the road, I could even with the internal

313
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:14,080
microphone, uh, using cast blaster. Um, and, uh, yeah, it's, uh, it's a nice machine. I'm liking it.

314
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,760
I still do not like the windows experience, but hey, at least I can, uh, use it without the audio

315
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:25,440
stuttering. It's funny. You know, Apple, of course, recommends to get rid of this audio stutter, which is,

316
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,840
you know, incorrect that that's happening on a very expensive laptop. You know, their fix for now

317
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,080
is only use one audio application at a time. And of course, that doesn't work because you need to

318
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,280
have more audio applications open on the Mac in order to make it work. Interesting enough with

319
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,720
cast blaster, I only have one audio application open at a time, but it does work and it does get me where

320
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:55,040
I want to be. Hello Adam. I have a pretty big announcement to make to do a podcasting community,

321
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:00,080
but first of all, for those who don't know, uh, what my show looks like. Let's, uh, give a little

322
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:11,440
preview of it. 1984 won't be like 1984. Good your iPod, iPod tier, you like your Mac and I like your

323
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:17,440
Mac and I don't like the past. Apple, Apple, and the Mac and Has, of all of the scenes I've ever

324
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:24,880
seen is the only one that meets up here in the iPod, a thousand songs in the past. If today were the last

325
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:33,840
day of my life, what I want to do, what I'm about to do today. So I'm back on the microphone and

326
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,920
if today was the last day of my life, would I want to do what I'm going to do today? That's the

327
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:43,280
question I asked myself. And I answered the question by taking a pretty important decision.

328
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:50,720
I actually currently am a freelance IT man, so a freelance developer, so to be honest, I can

329
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:56,880
make a shit lot of money. But I'm going to stop this in three weeks and I'm going to start

330
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:03,520
earning almost no money because I'm going to turn to be a 100% podcaster. Actually, I'm going to be

331
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,360
kind of 50% podcaster and 50% feather because I will be getting something really nice with

332
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,040
my girlfriend to get her in a few weeks. And that's one of the reasons why I hit this opportunity.

333
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:19,840
So I will go ahead and I kind of quit my day job, but my day job was paying really well. And I

334
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:26,240
stopped this whole thing just for the last of the forthcoming baby and also for the last

335
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,160
of my show, which is called Pampampampampampampampampampampamp. As you know, and which is a show about

336
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:38,240
all Mac things, all Mac and iPad things. And it's in French, as you may know, but it's also

337
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:44,000
in English. And the third show is online with the Eddie Kim, the guy from Potion Factory,

338
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:50,240
that come the makers of Potcast Maker. And we also have the show in German and who knows

339
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,000
in which language we might do it in the future. So Adam, thank you for what all the things

340
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,640
you have done. And thank you for the PMM and thank you for the forthcoming PDM that I expect to use.

341
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,400
Soon. And by the way, I also, I would like, I don't know what I have to do to that. Maybe I have to

342
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:20,580
secure. As the first multi-speaking membrer of it. So whatever, I

343
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:26,080
would have to do. I'm kind of ready for everything, just for the importance of podcasting.

344
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,640
So, you'll soon owe everybody and return to pampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampampamp

345
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,720
Yeah, this is also a message to my listeners that's still going to know that three weeks from now I will be in trial

346
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:44,360

348
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:53,240
You know, let's quit. I think I mentioned this. I don't know if I did it last week, but in like two days in succession

349
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,800
Three people found out they were pregnant in a pod show

350
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:02,440
Actually, it was three guys to find out the girlfriends or wives were pregnant, but you know basically we say you're pregnant

It's too loud, but we weren't on the set.

366
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,240
There's music right here, go ahead, go with that.

367
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,960
People from is it, all in the mind is that the results

368
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,460
might hopefully happen in the imaginations design and see it.

369
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,460
So you have a mind that sounds like to my activities and it was.

370
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,960
Then the breeze that I've heard is,

371
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,960
our knees open, knees in my life.

372
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,960
Singing this song, and you can't hope one's sing alone.

373
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,960
No, it's just, it's my most giving,

374
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,960
but let you know, you belong, yes it's on.

375
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,960
A stand-in room that's kept on,

376
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on.

377
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Everybody's in the stars, we live in Chocolatini,

378
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,960
and soon my people will be born.

379
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,960
I will keep learning music in your head.

380
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,960
There's music playing in your head.

381
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,960
So listen, listen, listen,

382
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,960
do what we do for the same.

383
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,960
There's music playing in your head.

384
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,960
There's tension,

385
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,960
so you can't do it.

386
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,960
You should have the time to keep that music.

387
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,960
Say, I don't keep that music playing.

388
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,960
So listen, listen,

389
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,960
do what we do for the same.

390
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,960
There's music playing in your head.

391
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,960
I've got you to say,

392
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,960
I don't have to do it.

393
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,960
All I can do, I don't have to do it.

394
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,960
Check the hornets,

395
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,960
I draw the line to the left,

396
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,960
I've got everything,

397
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,960
I've got all the stations,

398
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,960
and it made a bad expectation,

399
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,960
except for casual sacred holds and cubby old salvation.

400
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,960
It's a fun room that's kept on,

401
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
keep on, all too mood.

402
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,960
It's a soul-reaching meal,

403
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,960
this shit is fake,

404
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,960
I can still find people.

405
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,960
Too long, too, too,

406
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,960
but all right with this proof.

407
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,960
Too long, too,

408
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,960
For the boys, what had it on you who live a time,

409
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,960
you have to keep on,

410
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,960
have to keep my life new year in your head.

411
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,960
There's music playing in your head,

412
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,960
so listen,

413
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,960
do what we do for the same.

414
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,960
There's music playing in your head.

415
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,960
There's tension,

416
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,960
why you've got to use your attention,

417
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,960
I don't keep them used to think

418
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,960
We're gotta keep them used to think

419
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,960
So listen, all the time

420
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,960
And while we're here, we're gonna say

421
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,960
There's music playing in your room

422
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,960
There's music playing in your room

423
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,960
There's music playing in your room

424
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,280
Here we go

425
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,580
People there is nothing

426
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:35,580
There's music playing in your head

427
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,580
So listen, all of this out of life

428
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,580
I'll be burned, I see

429
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,580
There's music playing in your head

430
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,580
There's no tension

431
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,580
When you can't do it, you're not getting out

432
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,580
You can't do it, you can't do it

433
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,580
So listen, all of this out

434
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,580
You're not being burned, I see

435
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,580
You play in your head

436
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,580
You play in your head

437
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:02,580
There's music playing in your head

438
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,580
There's music playing in your head

439
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,580
There's music play in your head

440
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:12,580
There's music play in your head

441
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:17,580
There's music playing in your head

442
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,580
There's music play in your head

443
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:26,580
Armhand still love that song

444
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:38,820
Oh, you can find that at the PodsA music network music dot pod show dot com lots of talk about the PodsA music network in the next couple minutes, but first I want to welcome a new podcast to the pod show network

445
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:48,020
If you have kids who can or in within earshot, you may want to turn the volume down. It's not entirely family safe this promo, but welcome squad cast.

446
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:55,980
Hello, we have to cut a promo. Yes, we do. Yes, you do. He's got to do it. Can he just put them on hold?

447
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,820
I got the nod

448
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,460
May which means fuck you

449
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:07,320
I've known you guys for 15 years, and this is the way out here about who get together. We watch videos. We'd exchange gifts and shit

450
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,320
Fuck you

451
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,680
Wait a minute, the kid with cystic fibrosis is roll and drunks

452
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:21,260
Yeah, they're hot. I told you I dated ones that I didn't know with the whole boot. No, we're talking about not calling them orientation

453
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,500
Hard on with a person attached to it

454
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:29,540
So you've installed iTunes and you're listening to music on your computer. No, no, no, so she's just called me

455
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:35,380
It's not what I said. You didn't let him finish Larry. He was listening on his computer. No, go ahead. No, still no

456
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,060
You know what okay, go ahead

457
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,860
Get him my kind of call. Hey Adam. Hey

458
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:48,120
Daily source code listeners. I'm Scott. I'm here with my friend Anthony. Hello. We are from the squad cast

459
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,640
squad cast is a weekly show of actually four idiots is just kind of hang around and talk shit and be stupid in whatever and

460
00:38:54,200 --> 00:39:00,580
For some unknown reason Adam wants us to join the pod show there. Yeah. Yeah. I mean maybe he had us head on something

461
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:06,720
Maybe we could have a week moment. I don't he is a fan of this and say I'm guessing somebody swapped it out with I'm gonna go with our snick and

462
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,840
Here we are

463
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:14,160
Really happy to be here. Uh, hopefully you just those of you haven't checked out the shows swing by and take peek-a-boo yarn

464
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,560
What we do you like to say we're you know, it's a sponge four guys Gavin about nothing and

465
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:23,120
Okay, she will hook up with some other shows and I have them do stick to shit. There's some fun things right right

466
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:27,360
So if you get some time come and check us out and add them thanks for inviting us

467
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,200
And I didn't hit my head

468
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
I don't know

469
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,920
The only criteria is if you want to join the networkers

470
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:48,080
You want to help make them that work grow and you want to grow your audience and you want to work towards quitting your day job. That's all

471
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,440
That's all that it takes you know

472
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,400
I'm not gonna judge what you do in your show. Although I did laugh a couple of times

473
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,400
I'm not listening to it

474
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:03,600
Okay, let me see what do we have to do? I got a couple things still schedule. Let's see first the promo

475
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
Regarding pod safe music

476
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,560
Matthew Eble is working on a series of

477
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,440
What is calling pod safe showcases and

478
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:21,480
He's gonna get back to me with a better lineup of the venues as he starts to figure that out. Let me just read the email

479
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:29,940
Okay, we're playing a one hour round of original pod safe tunes at the French Quarter Cafe and Nashville 10 to see French Quarter Cafe.com

480
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,560
That's Tuesday January 31st at 9 p.m. During Jack Scott's writers night

481
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,520
No, that's interesting. Venue is all ages no cover full menu with great gumbo

482
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,600
If we ever get a real supported pod safe showcase going on and can't get a whole high profile

483
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,760
Then you like third and Lindsey or the exit. I don't even know these venues

484
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:57,440
This place has a huge stage full-back line drums. Well, you know what? I think that this will be able to happen

485
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,240
I think we will be able to do pod safe music showcase as I think that

486
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,440
It's something that we really haven't worked on yet

487
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,920
That's why I played big mics two or dates yesterday

488
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,480
That's another way that podcasters can really help with the with the artist by the way

489
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:17,600
This is what traditional radio really has cornered pretty well, and you know the reason why clear channel has a huge concert promotion business is

490
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,640
Airplay really promotes

491
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:28,080
Live venues and so I believe the same can work with with pod casting and it could work very much on a meet-up like scale

492
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,280
You know where we have local chapters of pod safe showcases and

493
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,000
They put together promos that Daniel can run throughout the network or individuals can oh my god

494
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I have a heartburn you won't believe

495
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Oh

496
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,920
Oh, man, hold on let me take something for that. So they with me. Okay. Lay it open up the other mics so you can hear me actually travel over here

497
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:52,000
Now I've got to get something for this out of my coat pocket

498
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,240
You know what that is. It's too much freaking senseo hold on

499
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,560
Where's my emergency stash?

500
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,560
Here we go. Oh, yes

501
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,560
Sorry, I'm desperate need of a

502
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:11,120
Calcium product here. Okay, let me go excuse me while I put pop this in my mouth. Oh

503
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,560
Okay

504
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,760
Anyway, so I think that can really work check out

505
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,920
Matthew ebel.com for more information and of course for beer and coffee

506
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,920
Which is the name of his lifestyle?

507
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,240
yesterday

508
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,720
I didn't quite get to the pricing. I've gotten so many requests in your information about okay

509
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,080
So you guys are going to start selling tracks on pod safe music network

510
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:40,240
Which is really just that. I mean all we're doing is enabling the commerce portion now to make this the whole

511
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,600
Unlabel concept we have to be able to enable podcasters and listeners to help promote

512
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,840
And the easiest way it seems to me is through a kind of affiliate network so you just you know post a

513
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,720
Logo link a button whatever it is to to the artist page when the pod safe music network and right there

514
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,680
Any tracks that they have enabled. It's not obligatory or compulsory that they've enabled for

515
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,240
Purchase can be purchased right there

516
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,840
What surprises me is that

517
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,400
Just a ton of people are saying what's the split's going to be now? I

518
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,680
Let me just talk about this for a second. I'm not a big believer in

519
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:26,720
Let me back up laying back up. I'll tell you what I'm a I am a big believer in is is making this work

520
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,760
I'm not a big believer when it let's just take an example of these these ad sharing networks now

521
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,720
You know for Google to do ad cents. I know I'm confusing topics here, but it's just want to get it all out

522
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:45,520
When Google does ad cents the volume the sheer scale of this is so incredibly large

523
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,160
That it it works with podcasting. I don't know about

524
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:55,280
Advertisers showing up with their credit card and saying you know give me a couple spots here a couple spots there

525
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,720
I think that that's going to be very disappointing. I believe much more in taking the risk and guarantee

526
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,320
Payment based upon performance where the we sell advertising or not and that is and by the way

527
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,000
Advertising is not just inserts before after a podcast. Yeah, of course. It's a part of that

528
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,320
But that's not the end all the be all that we believe in valuing the relationship between the podcaster

529
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,800
And their audience whether you have a hundred thousand or a hundred listeners makes no difference you will be able to participate

530
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,560
In sponsorship opportunities at pod show

531
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:37,360
So we don't talk about splits. You know we guarantee money. That's what we do and we go off and we bust our ass and go make the money for you

532
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,680
So you have no risk that you put on yourself. We take the risk. Okay

533
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,760
Now about the pod safe music network

534
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:52,160
I really don't know. I mean we have all kinds of thoughts and ideas and no one can really tell me exactly what it cost

535
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:59,200
99 cents song what you wind up having or what you wind up getting as an artist as an independent artist that is

536
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,040
It kind of it's all over the map and it depends of course in how much you sell

537
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,680
I think this is something that we have to figure out and I think that the beta part of this

538
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:14,240
Of this program we're just going to roll it out see if it works get make sure people are happy with the entire purchasing experience

539
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,920
And we should figure out you know what the actual cost is going to be what the split should be and really

540
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:26,240
I'd like to turn around and say I'd like to hear from pod safe artists how much they're willing to split

541
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,320
with people who help themselves. So what do you think is fair?

542
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:37,440
And let's just take our 99 cent model. Let's not talk about percentages. Let's talk about cents. You know real pennies here

543
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:46,080
What do you think is a fair amount if if someone sends a buyer from a podcast show side or a

544
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:53,360
listener a fan who has promoted your music or maybe someone who created a music video using your music

545
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:59,200
You know if if a sale results of that what would you like to give away to the the promoters of the music

546
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,080
Tell me that and then make it a lot simpler to start and break it down

547
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,680
One things for sure as we enter this beta period and I'm just going to say this will be three months this beta period

548
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,680
Isn't we need three months to get through it

549
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:16,800
We're going to take no money from this everything will go to the artist except for the actual credit card transaction fee

550
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,800
Which I think is like nine or ten cents

551
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,040
off of the

552
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,040
You know off of your theoretical dollar

553
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:30,080
You're 99 cents because that's a hard cost us everything else. You know I don't even want to get into it if we start

554
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,400
Talking about splits first before we actually get anything going

555
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,080
I think it could it could really bring down the whole concept so pod show will take

556
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,560
Nothing while we roll this out and beta and we're going to work on this together

557
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:47,200
And we're going to come to something that's fair and we'll lay out our costs on the line and we'll see what we can come up with

558
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:54,480
I've never considered this to be a huge money making opportunity for for pod show

559
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,040
In fact we've never even put the pod save music network

560
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,840
I don't think it's even in any of our projections. It may be in the back of our mind, but dude

561
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,640
We have to have so much success before something like this you know it starts to pay off

562
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,800
Even pay off the cost of the people working on the pod save music network, but that's not the point

563
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,360
I'm looking at the overall

564
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,640
The bigger picture of what this can really mean and how we can undermine

565
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,880
Well, I'm not out to undermine the music industry, but let's make some stuff right let's create our own industry

566
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,200
And let's not go straight into the split's conversation so we're just going to say hey, fine

567
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,560
We'll take nothing while we figure it all out for the first three months and it's going to be up to the artists

568
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,960
Primarily to feed that back to us and remember

569
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:42,560
The unlabeled consists of the infrastructure the consists of the network

570
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,680
podcast a consist of the pod save music network, but really consists of listeners

571
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,360
fans

572
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:55,760
Who can also be podcasters at the same time, of course, and just podcasters who who love to play the music who are going to help promote this

573
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,160
That's what's working

574
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,160
Okay, so

575
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,160
Let me know what you think

576
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,760
That split should be and we'll work on that, you know, and we'll we'll come up with something in the next couple of months that everyone will be happy with

577
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,840
It's the same way we

578
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:14,240
We start the pod save music network to start with, you know, we had terms and conditions we got some feedback

579
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:19,280
We changed them no big deal and everyone was cool with the changes all they must say Cory

580
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,000
Doctor was never reported on that change after he wrote that

581
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,080
That article I'm boying, but that's okay. That's very typical of him, I guess

582
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,440
Hey, low strawberry barking for three again

583
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,520
Okay, so we've gone through that

584
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,520
Oh, had another comment here

585
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,360
Brendan Bulger Adam or Bulger, or maybe I enjoy this so each day and have been listening for the past few months

586
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,760
And this is based on Patricia's comment from yesterday the gaelic language is alive and well

587
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,200
There's some podcast in the language google podcast and gaeli

588
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:58,960
Patricia said who wants to hear gaelic? I said no baby. That's not the point anyone who wants to should be able to and in fact

589
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:05,120
In Ireland the European Union will recognize Irish is one of the national languages next year

590
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:10,880
I guess that's gaelic then a gaelic derivative and check this Microsoft release windows XP in office

591
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,640
2003 in ilish Irish gaelic just last year so

592
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,960
Wow, I wonder if I could learn gaelic that might be kind of cool

593
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,760
Just be able to throw some gaelic out there

594
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,440
This heartburn is killing me

595
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:33,600
Okay, a couple more pieces of the audio feedback this one really tickled me. I didn't think anyone would actually take the Walmart challenge, but yep, somebody has

596
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:46,560
Ladies and gentlemen, at times, there is my kids

597
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:55,200
Welcome to Walmart. That's right. I'm hurry to you remember this

598
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,880
And it's said one of these lists which I thought was pretty funny. It's 15 things to do at a Walmart while your

599
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,440
Spouser partner is taking their sweet time and

600
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:15,680
So this list of 15 things which I think are pretty funny. They would be even funnier if someone actually recorded doing these any one of these 15 things at Walmart

601
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:22,000
And if you send me if you send me any one of these will you actually do it like a sound seeing tour setup?

602
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I'll send you a t-shirt

603
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,840
Make a trail of tomato juice or should I say tomato juice on the floor leading to the rest rooms

604
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:38,720
I'm pushing my cart and hopefully this works. What I've got in my pocket. I've got a small

605
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,240
Sunni deep bottle of the kind of plastic one the kind of fine

606
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,880
I can your lunch bag

607
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:51,280
And two in and why does I have to the bottom and I drill the small hole and in that hole I stuck a

608
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,480
A piece of tubing from the fish deck

609
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:00,320
And I've got this thing in my coat pocket. I've got a little hole on the inside of my coat pocket

610
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:07,520
And then running inside my pants down my pants ladies this too and it this works that I can reach in my pocket

611
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,320
And undo the clamp on the fish

612
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:19,120
hose and the tomato juice that is now in the Sunni deep bottle will run down the tube and onto the floor

613
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,000
And it will be very discreet. Let's see how this works

614
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:30,880
All right, have I done the clamp? I'm going to try to keep moving while I did this so I'm very

615
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,880
Inconpicuous

616
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,120
All right, it's dribbling out

617
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,480
Okay, it's really stuck into

618
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,080
Flow well

619
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,720
Okay, now I'm here

620
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,360
I'm afraid to pull that look at it

621
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,000
And that's gross, is that not cool?

622
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,960
I'm going to keep going. I'm going to grab and go on in the bathroom

623
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,960
While handling guns in the hunting department, ask the clerk if he knows where the antidepressants are

624
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,720
Hey, could I look at that one chest or anything over there

625
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,400
This one is this one right here. Okay, I'm going to start

626
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,120
You go sir

627
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,840
It's really nice

628
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,280
How about how about how much is this thing? I'll talk to you since you're not

629
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,880
All right cool. How about can you go? How about that limit to right next up?

630
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,360
Let's see what I'll try to do

631
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:44,880
You go sir

632
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,840
Does this shoot pretty?

633
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,840
Straighten them to go and pull my stuff

634
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,240
Have you ever shot it?

635
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,240
No sir, but

636
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,240
The way the staffs

637
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,240
Otherwise it returns, I'm guessing it's a pretty good

638
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,280
Okay, great. Can you go? Hey, you got a question

639
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,480
Um

640
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,480
Where do they sell the antidepressants?

641
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,480
Excuse me sir

642
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,680
Hey, yeah, antidepressants. Where can I find the antidepressants?

643
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,280
The antidepressants

644
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,480
The antidepressants

645
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:14,720
The pharmacy

646
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,480
I can't break them out. Great great. Well, I appreciate your help

647
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,280
Yeah, that's me

648
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,480
Well, I wonder if you want to get the entire trip filled with me in a Walmart with a bedtime story's

649
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,880
My kids love it. Don't be dumb. You got me at mkl.com

650
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,560
Oh, yeah, mb was an extra large. Bye, antidepressants

651
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,880
Oh

652
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,120
Extra large antidepressants away my friend

653
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,920
I only heard the promo. I haven't listened to them

654
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,320
I hope you did all 15 of them

655
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,320
That's so mean

656
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,760
We got to get your better recording system though because the quality was

657
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,560
Unfortunately it would be so much nicer. We had nice

658
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:58,720
Broad stereo phonic binorals sound nice and clear, but

659
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,920
Very cool

660
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:06,560
Man, that's excellent. I have like 20 more things I would want to do but we're already at 53 minutes

661
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,760
So I'm gonna leave it at that for now tomorrow be back of course with the
