Delta Sierra Charlie 467.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,480
This is control.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,760
Can you identify yourself, sir?

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,760
Please.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,760
This is control.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,760
This is control.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,760
Can you identify yourself, please, sir?

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,760
Roger, I hate you faintly in the background.

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,760
It sounds something like Delta Sierra Charlie.

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,760
Hang on.

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,560
What's it?

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,360
All right.

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,960
It's Adam Curry, everybody.

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,760
Adam's here.

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,160
A $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,760
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,760
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,760
It's Adam Curry.

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,760
Everybody in the house is ready to party.

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,760
Let me hear your signal.

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
Let's go.

25
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
Stop.

26
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,760
I take you get yourself pumped up.

00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,760
I turn a little brush into you got to jump up.

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,760
Sometimes I gotta put the tape on my back.

29
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,760
Make sure that we win and break it back.

30
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Stop.

31
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
I let him know you in the building.

32
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,760
Everybody may win and the children.

33
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,760
We ain't gonna do the way.

34
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,760
No more.

35
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,760
We gon' stop.

36
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,760
We ain't gonna fight him out of the floor.

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,760
To the reader.

38
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,760
We gon' make one thing real clear.

39
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,760

00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,760

00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
We gon' go crazy.

43
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,760
Everybody in the house is ready to party.

44
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,760
Let me hear your signal.

45
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
Let's go.

00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,760
Yeah.

00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,760
Yeah.

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,760
Yeah.

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
Yeah.

53
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,760
Stop.

54
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
Stop.

55
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
Stop.

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
Stop.

57
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
Stop.

58
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,760
Stop.

59
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,760
Stop.

60
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,760
Stop.

61
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,760
Stop.

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,260
Stop.

63
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,260
Stop.

64
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,260
Let's go to the reader.

65
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,260
The blood's just here.

66
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,260
They're making it clear.

67
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,260
A brand new sound getting dawn up in the air.

68
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,260
Yeah.

69
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,260
Yeah.

70
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,260
Yeah.

71
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,260
Yeah.

72
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,260
We see her.

73
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,260
This is something different.

74
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,260
Make it a grapple brow.

75
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,260
What an issue is.

76
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,260
Raise your body.

77
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,260
Come in.

78
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,260
Some with the watch.

79
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,260
And make it clear.

80
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,260
We gon' do the way.

81
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,260
We gon' like it just don't break.

82
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,260
Everybody in the house is ready to party.

83
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,260
One, two, three, four.

84
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,260
Yeah.

85
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,260
Yeah.

86
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,260
Yeah.

87
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,260
Yeah.

88
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,260
Yeah.

89
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,260
Yeah.

90
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,260
Yeah.

91
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,260
Yeah.

92
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,260
Yeah.

93
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,260
Yeah.

94
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,260
For the reader.

95
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,260
Stop.

96
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,260
Stop.

97
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,260
Stop.

98
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,260
Let's go.

99
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,260
The reader.

100
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,260
Stop.

101
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,260
Stop.

102
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,260
Stop.

103
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,260
Let's go to the reader.

104
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,260
Turn down the truck.

105
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,260
They're going to.

106
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,260
We can't join a wireless ticket.

107
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,860
The band plays the tool, so then I know you

108
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,360
Stop the pictures in your new and old suits

109
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,660
You are your whole soul, you know we're taking it hard

110
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,060
The boys picking their back up in the rookie car

111
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,560
It's not the 20 yards, they call their grandson

112
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,260
Give it up for the team, so we're getting it hard

113
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,060
To the reader, we don't make one thing real clear

114
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,460
To all my people can down right here

115
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,660
We don't party like this all these

116
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,260
So don't know how to say that we are

117
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,760
I know the way you are like it's a stone trader

118
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,260
Everybody in a mess, you ready to applaud

119
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,260
Let me hear your signal

120
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,260
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

121
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

122
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,260
Well bunch yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

123
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,260
Stop the bleachers, hey everybody, how you doing?

124
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,260
Welcome to the Daily Source Code

125
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,260
Wow, come on!

126
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,260
Coming to you via podcast and serious

127
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,260
Satellite stars 102, it's a start of a new weekend, man

128
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:21,260
It's been a busy one, of course, when the midst of getting the house shit together, and this morning I had a nice visit from

129
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,260
A gentleman from his royal majesty, royal majesty's

130
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,260
Revenue and custom service

131
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,260
Regarding ex-ice, duty drawback on ships and aircrafts

132
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,260
This is something Captain Dan found out for me, that

133
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:46,260
You actually can get money back if you fly and use fuel for aviation

134
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,260
I'm not quite sure what the percentage is, but it's enough that Captain Dan got all the numbers out

135
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:58,260
When you're flying around as much as we do, it does kind of add up, it could be easily a thousand pounds

136
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,260
I'm going to get back, I love this

137
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,260
It's a very little known thing that you can get ex-ice duty back

138
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,260
Anyway, that song from the wild bunch

139
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,260
That's what Jersey Todd turned to song to on Friday

140
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,260
It's, I don't think it's up on the podcast music network yet

141
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,260
Both he and I have been in touch with the record company

142
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,260
They've given me permission to play it in Jersey Todd and actually Todd

143
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,260
Completed on any show that he can get it on to

144
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,260
I just hope we can get them on the podcast music network

145
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,260
Because gosh, that song is so incredibly good

146
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,260
Patricia was even talking about it over the weekend, said that song

147
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,260
That's a major smash

148
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,260
Please put it on the podcast music network, so we can all get behind it and show something

149
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,260
It'd be so cool and there's more happening with podcast music

150
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:49,260
It really is spinning around the globe, proving that we're all part of one kind of thing

151
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,260
All the winds blow and all the winds are one

152
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,260
It's working all over the world, listen to this piece of feedback I got

153
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:02,260
Hi Adam, this is Dean, I'm a software engineer down here in Houston, Texas

154
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,260
NASA and an aspiring musician, and I just wanted to call him

155
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,260
Where are the tapes? That's what I want to hear about, where are the tapes?

156
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,260
Let you know how much the daily source code is wrapping around my real life

157
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,260
I was listening to our local community radio station about a month ago

158
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,260
And I had a local duo on called Smife and Taylor, who we're talking about

159
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,260
Going and touring England and playing at a deal fast in Guilford England

160
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:34,260
The light just went on in my brain, and then today I go to

161
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:40,260
Plug in my headphones, fire up the daily source code, sip in my diet coke, logging into my email

162
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,260
And what comes on, but me and Jean Kelpton and the die hards who are a local

163
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:51,260
Blues band down here in Houston, that I've heard on the radio, I've seen them in clubs

164
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,260
And now they're on the daily source code, this world is just getting too crazy

165
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:01,260
Anyway, have a great weekend and enjoy the source code, and the guy was right

166
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:08,260
By David Epilitos, almost Bob Dylan, but nobody can be Bob Dylan, come on now

167
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:13,260
That's what I was sitting at this morning going full to scruncher

168
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,260
Then I checked the next voice mail

169
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,260
Adam, this is Dean, and Houston, Texas again, I forgot the most important part

170
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:29,260
I love that, I love it, it truly is one big world that we're all in, fantastic

171
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,260
And then the voice mail right after that, when after he called back and said he was a folder, was this

172
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:40,260
I had a my name is buddy, bro, I am the national motion structure, jam bone records

173
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:46,260
I love that, hi, I'm buddy, the national promotion director, jam bone records

174
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,260
Let me just stick you to bone bone

175
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,260
Thank you for playing one of our hardest on your podcast, me and Jean Kelpton and the die horse playing my baby

176
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:00,260
Don't wear no things, I know your listeners enjoyed listening to that, and we hope that you use our music in the future

177
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:07,260
Again, if I can do anything, you can email me at buddy at jam bone records.com

178
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,260
And then he gives us his phone number, you know, buddy, let me just tell you something

179
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:20,260
Thank you, dude, thank you and the band and all of the forward thinking, forward looking, innovative

180
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:26,260
Record companies, independent labels, artists, promoters, managers, whatever it is

181
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,260
Putting your music up on the podcast music network really does bring results

182
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:39,260
It's fantastic for podcasting because it's a very simple resource, anyone who's a podcast or can sign up

183
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,260
And you can play all this great music and it just doesn't stop every day, there's tons of new songs coming in

184
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,260
And you can see it's being recognized around the world and people are really digging it, so thank you

185
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,260
For putting all of your stuff up on the podcast music network and sharing in that regard

186
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,260
And hopefully we're sending enough love back to you guys and people who are interested in buying stuff from you

187
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,260
And I hope our own purchasing system will go full, I still haven't heard from Chris Beshear

188
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,260
He was going to tell me when he's going to go full blown, but I think it's when we

189
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:14,260
I can't tell you too much, we're integrating, you know, pod save music network, of course with pod show plus

190
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,260
And I think that's when we're going to blow the sales wide open as well

191
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,260
I don't see any other thing that we could be waiting on, I will double check today for sure

192
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:28,260
Greetings Adam, so the doctor here from the blood cast, blood cast, dot com slash cast

193
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,260
I just wondered if you'd written these about

194
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:40,260
MTV and what it's been up to in its total date itself and now you haven't been in second life for a while, I think it's a bit of a shame

195
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:49,260
But there was news yet a day of MTV doing a deal with their dot com, which is another virtual world as you knew

196
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,260
Wait, is it called their dot com? I couldn't quite hear that home, just roll it back a second

197
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:00,260
The virtual world as it has MTV doing a deal with their dot com, it's another virtual world

198
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,260
I think I have heard of this, there's a couple of virtual worlds that worlds out there

199
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,260
So they're doing a deal with them, huh?

200
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,260
Johnny come lately

201
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,260
After months of whispers and speculation apparently

202
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,260
And it's basically MTV's creating a virtual degree in a beach to go to TV show

203
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,260
A virtual lagoon a beach

204
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,260
And I quote

205
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:33,260
Lough and the shows create avatar socialize the friends partaking and brood up and prowl around a fluid digital version of the orange county California city

206
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,260
It gave a show its name

207
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,260
And then today I throw another piece in New York Times

208
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,260
MTV is now acquiring maker of music oriented games and now they've gone and bought harmonics, which

209
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:55,260
His main product, they make sort of music oriented video games that their main product is guitar hero, which is a PS2 game

210
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,260
And you get a little simulated that looks like a guitar

211
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,260
And so makes you feel like a rock star

212
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,260
Without knowing how to play music or even leaving your bedroom according to the New York Times

213
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:19,260
Anyway, I just was quite interesting moves that your old employers are making sort of themselves into virtual worlds and two games

214
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,260
Wonder what you thought about it, anyway, you know I'm a scruncher, bye

215
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,260
Thank you, Dr.

216
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,260
And despite the fact that you're a scruncher, I love you to bits and you know that

217
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,260
Don't tell blog, okay

218
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,260
Yeah, I think MTV is really lost its way

219
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,260
I have to give some to Redstone the chairman of Viacom

220
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,260
I got to give him props, you know, he was right to get rid of Frustan

221
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:48,260
I don't know if this stuff is, if this stuff is still leftovers from from the Tom Frustan days

222
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,260
Tom Frustan, of course the CEO of MTV Networks

223
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,260
It was recently removed from his post

224
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,260
And now there's two other guys who are in there running the show

225
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,260
This is, oh man, give me a year, give me MTV for a year

226
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,260
It is so obvious what you should be doing in this new world

227
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:14,260
It is so obvious, the whole that is there is so big I could, I could do a 360 with my airplane in it

228
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,260
So we're going to fill that gap, I'm sure pod shell is just going to do that

229
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,260
I'm pod casting independent producers, this makes no sense

230
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,260
No sense whatsoever

231
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,260
Yeah, you know what, it's a shame, it really is a shame

232
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,260
I was telling him what to do in 1993

233
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,260
What I registered MTV dot com, it's got to be doing something different

234
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,260
I don't think acquiring game companies is going to do it

235
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,260
And I don't think any virtual world, it's ancillary stuff

236
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,260
You can't get more than 100 people into one simulator at the same time

237
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,260
That would be, you can only see that it's an expansion of your brand

238
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,260
That is anything, you know, large quantities of audience can jump onto this

239
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,260
It's so simple, so easy

240
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,260
That's a corporate America, I guess

241
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,260
MTV not the only one doing funky things, I'm sure you've read about this

242
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,260
Hi Adam, this is Pana Yotis from Greece

243
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:26,260
I was reading today that Apple is taking legal action against the sites that use the term pod casting

244
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:35,260
And pod cast, because they think that the term pod cast is a copyright infringement of the ripod trademark

245
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:44,260
Well, I think this is stupid, and they should stop acting like they have a stick up their ass

246
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:51,260
But would it be a nice idea to start calling it zoom cast, would they prefer that?

247
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,260
Folder

248
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,260
Yeah, Pana Yotis are buddy from Greece, check it in

249
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,260
Okay, so this is what's happening, apparently pod cast ready

250
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:09,260
Who make a kind of like, I think it's, it may even be based on on juice or iPod or lemon

251
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,260
They make a ready to go download thing that you can pop on

252
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,260
I think it comes on a memory stick and they're trying to get it embedded in players

253
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,260
And it's definitely a very good idea

254
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:26,260
And they, so here's the report that came out sometime last week, late last week

255
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,260
That they received a cease and desist letter from Apple

256
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:36,260
Regarding the use of pod cast ready and my potter

257
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,260
Now this is, I have not seen an actual blog post report or the cease and desist letter

258
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,260
Which, it makes me cautious, very, very cautious

259
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,260
Yeah, it's things on the internet just grab, catch fire

260
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,260
It runs around like wildfire, everyone's saying they hate Apple and it's stupid

261
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,260
And they're trying to now grab the pod cast name

262
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,260
I'm not too sure about that, I really am not

263
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,260
Let me just go back to, when before Apple announced iTunes was at 4.9

264
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,260
Where they had pod casting built into it

265
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,260
I had a meeting with Steve Jobs and we went through like two hours

266
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,260
Went through a whole bunch of things and then at the end of the meeting he said

267
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,260
He went through his whole, he was very kind

268
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,260
He went through a whole wrap about trademark and how you have to protect your trademark

269
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,260
And he said, we're going to have an issue protecting our trademark with iPodter.org

270
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,260
And I can understand because it's a derivative of the word iPod

271
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,260
And he said, can you, can you do something about that?

272
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,260
So you know what, we'll change it to indiepotter.org

273
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,260
You know iPodter.org, the links will remain

274
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:47,260
You don't want to break the internet, there's a million fucking links to go from iPodter to now indiepotter.org

275
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,260
But there was no problem, I didn't see a real issue and I understand how trademarking works

276
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:59,260
Now if it's really true that Apple is trying to go after the use of the word pod cast

277
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,260
And any service or product, then I think there is a major problem

278
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,260
But I'm not sure, I'm really not my potter, I understand that

279
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,260
It's also, you know, the my, the derivative of iPod

280
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,260
When lawyers get together, I've been through this exact

281
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,260
Type of legal procedure with mtv.com where it can become confusing for consumers

282
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,260
So iPod, my pod, iPodter, my potter, I can understand that

283
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,260
But is it also about podcast ready?

284
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,260
I've seen no proof of that and I'm going to be, I'm going to be very cautious

285
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:38,260
about taking real stake until I've seen exactly what the letter is. Now here's what I think is going on

286
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,260
There's a great article on zdnet

287
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:52,260
Excuse me, which really extrapolates all of the trademarks that Apple is trying to

288
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:58,260
Has filed and is trying to acquire one of them actually is the iPod trademark itself

289
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,260
And it's a lot of legalese and a lot of explanation so you'll have to go to

290
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,260
Theysourceco.com and click on the link in the show notes if you want to read it all

291
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,260
But it does seem that Apple has been trying to

292
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,260
Trying to trademark iPod cast

293
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:19,260
And that's been rejected several times to keep coming back at him and the US patent trademark office

294
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,260
As slapped them a couple times and it feels like the lawyers are kind of on the

295
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:29,260
Loosing edge of trying to get this trademark for iPod cast and perhaps and that may be the case

296
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:35,260
Maybe they're trying to strengthen their own position by going out and protecting

297
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:42,260
The iPod cast future trademark by going after anyone who's using podcast in their name

298
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:49,260
And I think that if if podcast read it really did receive a cease and desist for using the podcast

299
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,260
The podcast nomenclature in podcast ready

300
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,260
Then I think it's just lawyers who are just not understanding the marketplace

301
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:04,260
Not understanding what is happening not understanding how closely bound Apple is to podcasting in this huge community

302
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:12,260
Of people who will turn around and revolt and rebel against Apple if they try to grab the name podcast

303
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,260
I think it's almost impossible for them

304
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:23,260
I think that there's just no way and and look at how stupid it is from a business perspective indeed as ponayota said

305
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:32,260
You know, do we want to call it zoom casting would you rather have that it's like you know how dumb can you be do not alienate your customers that way

306
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:41,260
Again, I'm I'm being cautious because I don't know if that's really what they're going after but I can see if they're trying to register iPod cast where

307
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:49,260
Sending out these letters regarding pod the use of podcast would make sense from a legal perspective

308
00:18:49,260 --> 00:19:01,260
But certainly not from a company perspective Steve jobs. I know you're listening or someone who will pass this on to you is listening that just makes no sense because what happens

309
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:07,260
First of all, who cares podcast it's already the word pod is in there you have the iPod

310
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:19,260
You know there it's it's it's probably not even good for podcasting and for independently produced audio to use the word podcast because so many people believe that they can only receive it if they have an iPod

311
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:26,260
Which is not true you can listen to it online in a web browser. You can download it. You can play it on anything you can burn it to CDs

312
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:34,260
But if you go that route and you try to capture the name podcast, you're going to get some extremely pissed off

313
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,260
Not just customers fans, but also other types of people

314
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:50,260
Hello Adam Kerry who abuses sexually blackberry. I wanted to tell you that this fucking bastards hit people scum

315
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:59,260
Apple Corporation are suing people because some people are using podcast in the name for example

316
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:04,260
They're suing now www.podcastready.com

317
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,260
Fuck them fuck you Apple Corporation

318
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:13,260
I wanted to say that I never in my life owned an iPod

319
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:26,260
And I thought that the name podcasting is coming from pots coffee pots for the sensor machine that you are mentioning on your podcast on your audio recording

320
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:35,260
And the coffee pots for sensor are actually the inspiration of the name podcast and podcasting

321
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,260
If there's nothing to do with Apple I never had an Apple iPod

322
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:46,260
I don't know what iPod is. I was convinced that it is about a pot for coffee machine

323
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:52,260
The cell this batch was dedicated to coffee pots for sensor

324
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,260
Yeah, and case you're wondering

325
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,260
Comic strip

326
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:02,260
Comic strip

327
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,260
Comic strip

328
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,260
You do not want people like comic strip blogger to be your adversaries

329
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:19,260
So let's find out if this really is the case where the cease and the cease letter which not one single fucking journalist has questioned

330
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,260
Not one not a single one everyone just reprinting

331
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:28,260
Please if it really is a cease and the cease against podcast ready

332
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:32,260
And it says because of the use of the word podcast then I will

333
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:37,260
Trash every single Mac I have every single last one

334
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,260
And I'll put it on video and we'll put it on perversion for profit

335
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,260
And you're going to do the same

336
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,260
Hey there, I'm Christina Curry, one of the hosts of the BJ blast

00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,260
We even learn about hippo camps

341
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:05,260
And I share the star of my most recent drama and the dressing room of London's top shop clothing store

You got to listen to it. It's very different from pod save the queen which by the way

349
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:38,260
Christina is getting ready to do a new one. It's just been busy with starting school and everything

350
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,260
Yeah, it's on its way

353
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:51,260
Little different. It's a highly produced. It's fast. It's a full of prizes and fun

354
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,260
And and I just love hearing Christina Martinez. I haven't I've only heard two episodes

355
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,260
So far. I think third one is now yet, but you like it as well

356
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,260
And this this is what I call what do I have a promo?

357
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:07,260
I had him curry. This is Walter Flange. Really really big fan from the Walter Flange show

358
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,260
I'm sending you this promo for my show and I've written a song

359
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,260
I'm sending you this promo for my show and I've written a song

360
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,260
Sorry strange things have been happening around the home studio lately

361
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,260
I think it's possessed

362
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,260
Let me try this again

363
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,260
Walter Flange dot com

364
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,260

365
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,260
I have to tell you fruit roll looks can't go down the garbage

366
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,260
Mom you've interrupted my promo

367
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,260
I'll play blue oyster cult for me. I'm not playing blue oyster cult

368
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,260
Do you hear that? Okay, seriously

369
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,260
There's something paranormal going on in this space

370
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,260
Since you know you were conceived in the parking lot at a blue oyster cult concert

371
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,260
Yes, and that information is haunted my days

372
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,260
Now, would you get kind of here and let me finish

373
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:58,260
Walter, all I want is to see you do your little show

374
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,260
Okay mom, you can say

375
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,260
Walter Flange dot com

376
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,260
Give me five

377
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:14,260
Put me next to Adam Curry on your whole drive

378
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,260
Don't fear the reaper on baby

379
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,260
I'm your man

380
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,260
Mom

381
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,260
Christ, what was that?

382
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,260
Oh my goodness, our new neighbor is upstairs

383
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,260
Sweet little lady probably walked into one of your heights

384
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,260
She walked into the light

385
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,260
Any chance is this house built on?

386
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,260
An Indian burial ground

387
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,260
Mom

388
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,260
Mom

389
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,260
Mom

390
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,260
Mom

391
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,260
Walter Flange dot com

392
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,260
Check it out

393
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,260
Alright, like it, like it very much

394
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,260
We're talking

395
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,260
Talking a David Epilito about getting Sid Bernstein to do a podcast

396
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:03,260
And you know, Sid Bernstein the guy who brought the Beatles to America

397
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:07,260
And he's still so incredibly interested and involved in new music

398
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,260
I like this would be great

399
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,260
Let's get this guy to do something with pod save music

400
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,260
I put the question to David

401
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,260
Here's part of the answer

402
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,260
Adam, you know, first of all, I got to say thanks so much for all the cool things

403
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,260
Just say about my stuff and the way I write and what I write and why

404
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,260
But I really don't have a choice in the matters

405
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,260
Just who I am

406
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,260
But I wanted to talk to you

407
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,260
I wanted to send you a sound file about your idea that you had about my buddy Sid

408
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,260
Doing a possibly a serious satellite radio show or a pod show

409
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,260
It would be really cool thing

410
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,260
And I floated a pest said because for years

411
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,260
I've been trying, I'm a nobody

412
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,260
But I've been trying to think of a way

413
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,260
To get Sid

414
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,260
He's still just passionate about young artists

415
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,260
He was the day that he brought the Beatles here

416
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:58,260
He managed the rascals and put the stones in Carnegie Hall

417
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,260
He's the same guy

418
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,260
He's just been around a little while longer

419
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,260
And he loves music and he loves young artists

420
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:11,260
So I asked him, I said, Sid, would you be interested in doing something on the pod show network

421
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:19,260
Would you be interested in doing a show that promoted new music and new ideas?

422
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,260
This is what he had to say

423
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:26,260
Yes, I would, I had learned from my good friend David and Toledo

424
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:30,260
What you're doing and it sounds like a great idea

425
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:40,260
And this is your show is giving circulation to no ideas to what matters today

426
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:44,260
And thank God for the internet

427
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:49,260
To express views that have to be expressed

428
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:54,260
You know, not getting the circulation that should be getting

429
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:59,260
But by daily press and from our commercial radio stations

430
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,260
I should do it as a heck of an idea

431
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,260
I'm an advocate of the idea

432
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:10,260
I've spent a lot of my musical life

433
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,260
And as a musician, I enjoy my musician

434
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,260
But I'm one who works with musicians

435
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:21,260
And part of my life has been doing courage

436
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,260
In the classroom life

437
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:27,260
I have been teaching at the New School for number of years

438
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:32,260
To encourage and to try to give publicity

439
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:36,260
In any way I can by voice to new people

440
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,260
Who need attention and who do not get it

441
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,260
Don't get the recognition

442
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,260
To writing in and a vocal talent

443
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,260
I like the idea so much

444
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,260
And I want to let my voice to it wherever I tap

445
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,260
Yeah, that is effing

446
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,260
Cool

447
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,260
So I'm going to talk with David E. Toledo tomorrow

448
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,260
You know, we've got some time zone differences, you know

449
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,260
And we're going to set this up

450
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:07,260
This is going to be, I mean, I'm thinking of maybe Sid says or something like that

451
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,260
Can you imagine if you put a microphone in front of that guy

452
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:16,260
I think it's a great, very mature, you know, very authoritative voice

453
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,260
And he's, and he can relate stories

454
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,260
But he can also, I think he can do a lot for pod save music

455
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:25,260
So David, I'm going to brainstorm a bit on that tomorrow

456
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,260
And then we'll get something going for sure

457
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:45,260
And then we have Sid Sid

458
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:50,260
Shows what we hear and see

459
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:55,260
On radio and on TV

460
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,260
And Sid Sid have you

461
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:05,260
What makes your last so tight

462
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:14,260
Does the religious rights rule over you

463
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:19,260
Those two fanatic fools

464
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,260
And you are outraged

465
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,260
Just rules kick

466
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,260
Freedom in my family

467
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,260
Just let Sid see

468
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:32,260
Have you

469
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:36,260
Are we also

470
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,260
Repressed

471
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,260
What's more

472
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:46,260
It's a press must be taboo

473
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,260
One journalist

474
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,260
Trots and boom

475
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,260
Watched up what's on

476
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:11,260
That's, I love that

477
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:15,260
If you want to hear, if you want to know exactly what the lyrics are

478
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,260
It's a little hard to understand, I think

479
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,260
Just like a lot of religious songs

480
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,260
Go to FCCFU.com

481
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,260
And you'll be able to see a video with a little bouncing ball that helps you

482
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:32,260
Join the fight to tell the FCC to FU

483
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:37,260
I've got to put that up a version for profit

484
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:43,260
FCCFU

485
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,260
Don't

486
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,260
I'm the next test drive girl

487
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,260
We're going to be test driving the Hummer H3

488
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,260
Hey Adam, it's all the test drive girl

489
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,260
Next time you're in San Francisco, we'll have to test drive Trinity

490
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,260
Oh, and by the way, folder

491
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,260
Why are you saying folder?

492
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,260
So much for tore the paper

493
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,260
This is a bunch of shit

494
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,260
Check out the test drive girl

495
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,260
Excellent

496
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,260
That's on that Pa choe

497
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,260
Plus great video of the test drive girl

498
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,260
Testing out any car she can get her hands on

499
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,260
I think the next one is the Hummer

500
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,260
It's just great to go with a camera

501
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:29,260
A Holly and Jay Donnelly

502
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,260
And they say hey, we just like the test drive this car

503
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,260
And they film it all

504
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,260
I'd love it

505
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,260
I've always dreamed of a show like that

506
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,260
Oh, oh my god

507
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:45,260
You know what happens with a satellite with camera, but Jesse stops by a satellite repair man coming after you

508
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:49,260
Satellite repair man, watching all of you

509
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,260
Can't fix your misconceptions and answer questions too

510
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,260
Turn nothing in the universe and you can't do for you

511
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:59,260
Satellite repair man

512
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:04,260
Satellite repair man

513
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,260
Well now here he comes, he's got something to report

514
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:14,260
Listen here, it's the best that you could hope to get from good old Uncle Jesse shorts

515
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:17,260
Is the biggest find is mess you've ever seen

516
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,260
Or it's the best from this week's pot of sphere

517
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,260
That might be what we really mean

518
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,260
Well it won't take long, but that's okay

519
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:27,260
It'll make you want to stand up and say I can't get enough

520
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,260
Out of Uncle Jesse shorts

521
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:33,260
No sir, so let's get right into Uncle Jesse's value packed

522
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,260
And very important, super sized

523
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:41,260
His Uncle Jesse shorts

524
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,260
That's right

525
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,260
Hello, Daly source code listeners

526
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,260
This is P-Dub, also known as Uncle Jesse

527
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,260
And I need some help

528
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,260
I'm working on our new show called Uncle Jesse shorts

529
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,260
And despite what my wife fries might tell you

530
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,260
It has nothing to do with me walking around the house

531
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,260
And boxers and black socks

532
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,260
Or favorite outfit

533
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:06,260
No, it'll be a show promoting all those great short podcasts out there

534
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,260
The ones that are usually 10 minutes or less

535
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,260
Well I've been trying to find as many as I can

536
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,260
And I've discovered that nobody has a directory

537
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,260
That can be sorted by average show length

538
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,260
Not even pod show

539
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,260
So while I have plenty of short podcasts that I'm aware of

540
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,260
It's going to be hard to track down the ones I don't know anything about

541
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:32,260
So if you do a short podcast that you would like to have featured on this new show

542
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:37,260
Drop me a link at playmy shorts at gmail.com

543
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:41,260
Playmy shorts at gmail.com

544
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,260
I have been a love short podcast

545
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,260
And they don't get the exposure they deserve

546
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,260
So send them to me and I'll try to get them up there on the satellite

547
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,260
And get you some new listeners

548
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,260
Thanks for the time Adam

549
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,260
Keep an eye on that satellite window

550
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:01,260
One, two, one, six, two, five

551
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,260
Six, three, five, seven

552
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:09,260
One, two, one, six, two, five

553
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,260
Six, three, five, seven

554
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,260
Hello Adam

555
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,260
It's my turn I have from the gentleman

556
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:22,260
We've been about on GSE465

557
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,260
About shadow falls

558
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:29,260
And doing a setup on it on pod show island

559
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,260
We're in the corner

560
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,260
I have to show out under it as a shadow falls

561
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,260
But I'd like to see if that's the thing expand a little bit

562
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,260
Wouldn't like to know how long I'll take it away

563
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,260
Because I do like the past

564
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,260
And I do love the palace and hang out there

565
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,260
So I'd like to see the shadow falls

566
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,260
thing a bit more in handstander

567
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,260
Expand a little bit

568
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,260
And I'll bring it to the waist out of ecstatics

569
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,260
Anyway, check out me get a show with a good name

570
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,260
She'll go and then.co.com

571
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,260
Scrunch out

572
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,260
Alright, dude, yeah, absolutely

573
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,260
And by the way apologies for the full paw

574
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,260
Last week when I was talking about this

575
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,260
So Brittany, I think it's you slam me

576
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,260
So you don't know we've had a shadow falls

577
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,260
Woods there for the longest time

578
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,260
And I'm talking about changing everything

579
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,260
You know, really changing everything

580
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,260
Having people whose avatars are

581
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,260
And our characters from the series

582
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,260
If you don't know what I'm talking about

583
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,260
Go to shadow falls.podshow.com

584
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,260
And you'll get quite an education

585
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,260
Audio drama is back

586
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,260
Theatre of the mind rules

587
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,260
And I think it's a great idea

588
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,260
But I do have to leave that up to my SLGF

589
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,260
Brittany Mason

590
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,260
She'll have to make the final call

591
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,260
And that because people do love the palace as well, you know

592
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:46,260
So hey, drop this number into your cell phone

593
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,260
And put the first get a plus in there

594
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,260
Because then that way if you travel outside the country

595
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,260
You won't have to reprogram the number

596
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,260
One

597
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,260
Two zero one

598
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,260
Six two five six three five seven

599
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,260
Notice I found the jingle again

600
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,260
Yeah, so whenever you have a question

601
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,260
That we can answer or address here on the Charlie

602
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,260
You just grab the phone and dial

603
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,260
Don't have to go to the show notes

604
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,260
Where the number of course is always listed

605
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,260
But it's handy to have around

606
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,260
I am and from my no body cast

607
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,260
I would like to thank you for playing

608
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,260
That palm line you show you me this is very popular

609
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,260
And I do

610
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,260
Oh yes, so are the ways of the pod father

611
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,260
Question

612
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,260
How does the plane get all of its power

613
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,260
Like all lightens

614
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,260
I'm like a

615
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,260
Get out of mind is it like an alternator

616
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,260
Because all I know is that it's a jet field

617
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,260
Which power is the engines

618
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,260
It's like an alternator

619
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,260
How does it get us power?

620
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,260
Because I don't think it could be

621
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,260
I find it at last that long

622
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,260
So play on the show

623
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,260
And all we have to hear the answer

624
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,260
You write by

625
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,260
That way

626
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,260
And I am in full of it

627
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,260
It's an interesting question

628
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:59,260
I don't know if it's an alternator

629
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:02,260
But if you're throwing jet fuel into something

630
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:05,260
That'll into a turbine that turns

631
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,260
Of course it can propel you

632
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,260
Also do a lot more with just a little bit of extra energy

633
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,260
So yeah

634
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,260
That's the same way it works

635
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,260
In piston powered planes

636
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,260
You've got gyros

637
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,260
And all kinds of stuff rolling around

638
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,260
Creating spark and creating electricity

639
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,260
It's pretty easy to tap into that

640
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,260
And use it

641
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,260
But of course you could be an airline pilot

642
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,260
And only use battery power

643
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,260
But you get some interesting results

644
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,260
Hello

645
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,260
I'm Mr. Robin with another cup that's called

646
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,260
On my way to St. Thomas today

647
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,260
That's last time

648
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,260
Kind of

649
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,260
Wonder and folder

650
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,260
Scruncher or cruncher

651
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,260
Instead I'm a folder

652
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,260
And a one time cruncher

653
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,260
So here's the scenario

654
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,260
Just imagine survival training

655
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,260
Out of the woods

656
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,260
Colorado

657
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,260
You've got to go

658
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,260
Do the paperwork

659
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,260
There is no paperwork

660
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,260
So

661
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,260
Got to use leaves

662
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,260
Pines straw

663
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,260
Whatever you can find

664
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,260
And that

665
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,260
Is crunching

666
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,260
It's long tailwind

667
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,260
Yeah tailwinds back at your Robin

668
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,260
Of course, inside works

669
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,260
And the diva cast

670
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,260
Up there

671
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,260
I think it's a

672
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,260
Fly 747's

673
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,260
So if you ever wonder

674
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,260
When you sit in there

675
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,260
Scrunched up

676
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,260
In your seat

677
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,260
Probably next to someone who

678
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,260
Does not belong in just one seat

679
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,260
And the guy in front of you

680
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,260
Was pushed to seat back

681
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,260
And crunched your laptop

682
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,260
Screen for the 20th time

683
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,260
You're wondering what the flight crew

684
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,260
What your flight crew is doing up there

685
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,260
Up at the front of the plane

686
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,260
They're worrying about important things

687
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,260
About what the rest

688
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,260
With branches and leaves

689
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,260
Yes, yes

690
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,260
This is podcasting

691
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,260
Exposing the true nature of the flyboys

692
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,260
Hi Adam

693
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,260
Hi

694
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,260
I'm Sam Idol

695
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,260
I'm really looking forward to seeing

696
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,260
Beatly caught ship being unleashed in the UK

697
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,260
Um

698
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,260
I was wondering whether you'd heard

699
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,260
About the floor

700
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,260
We just been around

701
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,260
Put cast

702
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,260
Paul

703
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,260
At the third number

704
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,260
130

705
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,260
The nice

706
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,260
Um

707
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,260
So we say

708
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,260
I'm too Islamic

709
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,260
Comment

710
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,260
And I've been quite a lot of

711
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,260
Comment friends

712
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,260
On his podcast website about that

713
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,260
I wonder if you'd heard about that

714
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,260
And what your opinion was

715
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,260
Um

716
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,260
Yeah

717
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,260
Very differently worth listening

718
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,260
There we go

719
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,260
With all your podcast

720
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,260
Paul dot com

721
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,260
And so that's it

722
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,260
Thank you so much for playing this comment

723
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,260
If you do

724
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,260
And

725
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,260
Um

726
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,260
I've become a folder

727
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,260
But I don't need quite no difference

728
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,260
Uh

729
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,260
If you give any website

730
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,260
They can tell me whether on the folders

731
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,260
Or scruncher please let me know

732
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,260
Okay

733
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,260
Thanks Adam

734
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,260
Okay

735
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,260
Uh

736
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,260
I think it's scruncher or folder dot com

737
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,260
This way you can find out if you are

738
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,260
And doubt is to

739
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,260
What the part of the population you belong to

740
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,260
The folders or the scrunchers

741
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,260
Regarding podcast Paul

742
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,260
Interesting

743
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,260
I haven't heard it yet

744
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,260
I am subscribed to podcast Paul

745
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,260
So I'll go and have a listen

746
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,260
And see what he said

747
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,260
And then maybe we can start a conversation

748
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,260
Sounds like someone tripped up

749
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,260
So it's going to be interesting

750
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,260
Controversy here in the UK

751
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,260
Keep your submissions coming

752
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,260
To btpodshow.com

753
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,260
Um

754
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,260
We've got this amazing amount of stuff

755
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,260
That's coming in a lot of videos

756
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,260
Stuff too

757
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,260
Just so much talent here

758
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,260
Just so much with no place to go

759
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,260
Can't wait

760
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,260
I think November is when we kick into high gear

761
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,260
Also next week

762
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,260
The digital music awards

763
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,260
Which pod show it's co-sponsoring

764
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,260
And

765
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,260
Of course

766
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,260
BT

767
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,260
British telecom is a sponsoring the show

768
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,260
I think we're going to be on the show

769
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,260
Which airs on channel for

770
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,260
I'll get all the details for you

771
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,260
I think that's Tuesday

772
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,260
Maybe October 4th

773
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,260
DMA06.com

774
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,260
All right

775
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,260
Why would you want more song here

776
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,260
Um

777
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,260
I saw this song

778
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,260
I hope that I find out about this

779
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,260
I'm just a sucker for a country song

780
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,260
Trendy Lane

781
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,260
When Angel's cry

782
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,260
I'm your daddy source code

783
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,260
Everybody

784
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,260
I'm all the directions

785
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,260
Right from the start

786
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:05,260
As you handed me your lines

787
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:09,260
I held back the tears

788
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:16,260
Until they had to fall

789
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:20,260
And I just watched you

790
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,260
While right at that door

791
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:30,260
You know I'm not that strong

792
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:35,260
And I don't want to cry

793
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:41,260
And any more

794
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,260
Now I'll be

795
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:49,260
Every beat of my heart

796
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,260
I knew I would lose you

797
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,260
Right from the start

798
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:59,260
But I came to realize

799
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:04,260
There's a power in disguise

800
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,260
In my life

801
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:10,260
With love dines

802
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:17,260
His God with the angels cry

803
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,260
When you close my door

804
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,260
I close one two

805
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,260
But there's still a window

806
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,260
You're waiting for you

807
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:36,260
If you say you're sorry

808
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,260
I don't want to

809
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,260
But there's still a window

810
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,260
You're waiting for you

811
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:48,260
If you say you're sorry

812
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:53,260
I will forgive you

813
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,260
Yes, I will

814
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:00,260
But there's still a thing

815
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,260
Now I just want to

816
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:06,260
I can love you

817
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,260
My whole life through

818
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:14,260
But I don't want to cry

819
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:19,260
Any more

820
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,260
This is a power

821
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,260
In disguise

822
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:32,260
You angels cry

823
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,260
Sorry

824
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,260
It's the yank in me

825
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,260
Trinity Lane

826
