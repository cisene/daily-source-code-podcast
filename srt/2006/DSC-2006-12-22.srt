1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey, there's this Chris of Tips on the Top floor, see you all in 2007. Have a good one.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Just from the top, from the top floor tips, from the top of right, from the top floor.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Either at him, this is the king, the king of Fubar.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You know Adam, I was, I was a little bit of the other day, and I heard you, and the lady Patricia, Patricia Pah.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I was always like Pah, but you and Patricia were singing a lot of old songs,

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and it made me think back to the days when Elvis used to sing lots of songs,

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and it made me kind of blue about the holidays there, Adam.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So I was a wonder if you might sing with me, sing one of my Christmas classics, blue Christmas.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
All right, here we go, one, it is two, and three.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh, I know the blue, Christmas without you, that's without you Adam.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, I'll be here so blue, thinking about you.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Well, Adam, I just wanted to say that epic Fubar Friday for Christmas and kicking off the

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
D.O.C. 518.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation radio content in my ears.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm guessing it's Adam Curry.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I did it five.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's Friday everybody, it's Fubar.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Come on.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Stop joking, Mark.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Go away.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I did it five.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Then, it's Friday.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Fubar Friday.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Here we go.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's it.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There you go.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I know you're going to dig this.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You see what I'm saying?

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The evacuation order acknowledged.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Sorry, minutesetty.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You can see.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Sorry, there...

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I see the,</�� Prinzipian image.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
음 for your foot.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There you go.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Say a diction and dance at every corner of our world.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Understand the cost of the car still exists.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And my family I'm at the meeting in my future.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The route that meets my eyes

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Okay, I don't have one that's good, but I'm fucking calling you now and I'm full.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I heard a song, the way you'll be.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Snooze must be written to me only.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And the energy of this melody is seen to them, say it's a time.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But they really, with a restless state of mind.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But the sound of the music charging in to fool me through and set me free.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So, here we are in the sky to get the birds I do.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And that's such a wonderful basis until I've found you.

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:13,000
To you feel the force of the music charging on to rescue you and set you free.

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So, here we are in the sky to get the birds I do.

52
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So, here we are in the sky to get the birds I do.

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So, here we are in the sky to get the birds I do.

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So, here we are in the sky to get the birds I do.

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So, here we are in the sky to get the birds I do.

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So, here we are in the sky to get the birds I do.

57
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So, here we are in the sky to get the birds I do.

58
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So, here we are in the sky to get the birds I do.

59
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So, here we are in the sky to get the birds I do.

60
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So, here we are in the sky to get the birds I do.

61
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So, here we are in the sky to get the birds I do.

62
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So, here we are in the sky to get the birds I do.

63
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So, here we are in the sky to get the birds I do.

64
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So, here we are in the sky to get the birds I do.

65
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I say this over and over again you know when you see something on the news or you read something in the newspaper and of course the only thing really true in the newspaper are the advertisements.

66
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And it is something you know about there is always something wrong with the story it is not amazing so the stuff that you don't know about is that completely correct.

67
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So, here is what I saw yesterday last evening on the BBC.

68
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And it was pretty cool they had the visuals graphics and they were explaining how airplanes land and what they were saying and here are the mistakes they were making they are saying well because of the fog the planes land on autopilot.

69
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I don't think so that yes planes can actually pick up a glide path and can glide all the way down but still the last couple hundred feet.

70
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You have to be able to see because the landing is done manually yes there are some aircraft that can do a complete it's look it's not recommended.

71
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I wouldn't want to sit in an aircraft is landing itself I really want to do that last little bit myself which is extremely important is really what pilots are trained to do.

72
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So, it's not true that the plane lands itself is just not in fact it's one of the most exciting things in the world for any aviator is when you're completely in the peace soup in the shit.

73
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And you're all you're doing is flying on instruments I gotta tell you this it's really is exciting because I've done it several times.

74
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So, you're not looking outside there's nothing to see because it's completely white it's a complete white out you're in the middle of the clouds or the fog or whatever it is IFR conditions as we call it.

75
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And particularly if you haven't been doing it for a long time you know if you actually look outside well then you get kind of a spatial disturbance like vertigo and before you know it you will have that aircraft upside down without even knowing you're even flying upside down.

76
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If you don't pay attention to the instruments by the way exactly what happened the JFK junior.

77
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So, you follow the you pick up the glide path you're looking at your instruments and yeah you can do it on autopilot but I've done it manually and you just keep following the glide path down and the tower can see you on radar and then all of a sudden.

78
00:09:42,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You break through the the bottom of the cloud or whatever the the distances that that you can have visual range and you see the runway and then if you've done everything properly and everyone's done their job then you are completely lined up right on the center line on the right glide path to just set it down nicely.

79
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So you do need to have some form of visual you need to be able to see something you need to be able to see the runway from wow I'd say it can't be much less than 150 feet probably 300 feet.

80
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So that's that's one part and and so they had that completely wrong in the BBC and then it was like he was showing the pointing out the radar antenna.

81
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And he said well you know even though they've got radar.

82
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's still very it's too you know it's there's too much going on for the radar to be able to to track the planes on the ground like hold on a second radar doesn't track planes on the ground okay.

83
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's done visually from the from the control tower so.

84
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The real issue is not necessarily take off so pretty much no problem either what the hell is that stay away from my jaguar.

85
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So taking off is not a problem but the the biggest issue is stuff happening on the ground so you know if you if you've been at a busy airport he throw of course is one of the busiest in the world.

86
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And you look at those planes stacked up one after another as they're coming in well they have to separate those planes much more like five to maybe even in severe conditions 10 mile separation.

87
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Because once you're on the ground you know it's like you got to be careful there's other shit going on there and and the pilot you know has limited visibility as well.

88
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:31,000
on the ground and then there's de-icing and all this stuff that just takes a lot of time so the airports aren't really closed.

89
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,000
They're just the reduced capacity 50% at least maybe even the 60% less capacity than normal.

90
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Let's just hope that the remaining 40% can include the in laws.

91
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I love them dearly really.

92
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You know what I'm saying right so I want to be with my family and they're very very busy.

93
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
For the holidays that whole thing yesterday about Christmas and the holidays.

94
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Paul Shepherd sent in the something that's exactly right he said interesting that the bridge used holidays as the word for vacation.

95
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
When the word holiday as it's entomology is it's entomology is holy day.

96
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I would have to say and I think I agree that when Americans say happy holidays were actually saying happy holy days.

97
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And I'm not quite sure how vacation could be the same as a holy day.

98
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So who's right the yanks or the brits.

99
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Hey Adam this is Ed Roberts from the pod safe Christmas podcast.

100
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You don't have to really out some like 80 tunes over at the pod safe Christmas podcast over the course of the Christmas season.

101
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I figured for the last four bar Friday with the whole due respect to the man jersey Todd that I would submit a one of my favorite pod safe Christmas tunes that were released this year to the pod safe music network.

102
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Now I'm a big fan of the band Chicago and this man the American angel kind of has that vibe to it, but especially true in their song the best part of Christmas.

103
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I tell you how much I like this song.

104
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I've been listening to it just like over and over again, especially as I've been getting ready for a I'm doing two one hour kind of mixtape versions of pod safe Christmas where I'm rolling out all the best tunes and I played over the course of the Christmas season this weekend.

105
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So kind of people have music for their Christmas celebrations.

106
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But as I've been preparing for this thing I just been listening this song over and over and each time I listen to it it gets better and better.

107
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So I hope you enjoy this song as much as I have American angel in the best part of Christmas.

108
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Enjoy Adam and Merry Christmas.

109
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The time is drawing here and we are getting much clearer about the good times than bad times and nothing between

110
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:32,000
There's a spirit capture here at you can read it in the air and with the sentence chilling winds and most don't seem to care.

111
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You can't put it right on, nothing we've been through.

112
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And even though it's Christmas, this is all I want from you.

113
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What I want to do is you don't get so sleepy.

114
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:01,000
If I give this my sin and my life's ain't enough, I only want to be with you on Christmas day.

115
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You can't put it right on, nothing we've been through.

It was DailySourceCode.com, a second life, here's one for you.

147
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,480
The illustrious Brittany Mason, who you probably know from Pod Show Island, has created

148
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:59,560
a video show, and you can find that at BrittanyMasonShow.podshow.com, I think you should

149
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,760
check that one out.

150
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,480
Hey Adam, I've got a proposition for you.

151
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,480
Oh, I like that.

152
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,760
How would you like to turn on thousands of women and not take the lovely lady Patricia

153
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
off?

154
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,760
Oh, that sounds like a deal.

155
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,680
Would you love to personally introduce women to a great way to use their hands, all

156
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,480
hours of the day, and night?

157
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,480
Ah, yeah, very good.

158
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,920
Hey, line out of the gutter.

159
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,920
Sorry.

160
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,600
I'm talking about introducing them to one of the most popular hobbies around.

161
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Scrap-up.

162
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Ah, yes.

163
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,440
My name is Lynette, and I'm the host of Scrapcast.

164
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,120
The world's first Scrapbook and paper arts podcast where we get to play with paper, scissors,

165
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,120
and glue, all the time.

166
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,920
Hey, why not turn some men on as well?

167
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:53,040
After all, Hugh Heffner is an avid Scrapbooker, and just look at he's got.

168
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:59,200
Scrapcast has been around since June 2005, but is brand new to the Pod Show family.

169
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,880
You can come check out the show at scrapcast.podshow.com.

170
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,480
Scrapcast isn't just a podcast.

171
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,640
It's Scrapbooking for your speakers.

172
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,640
Hmm.

173
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,640
Okay, Lynette.

174
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,120
And don't worry, Adam.

175
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,760
You've still managed to turn me on to podcasting that is.

176
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,800
Hey, girl, welcome.

177
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Fantastic.

178
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,640
Yeah, that's that's shit's big, man.

179
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,640
That's Scrapbooking.

180
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
It's pretty outrageous.

181
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
It's like knitting.

182
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,440
And we're looking at a number of knitting podcasts.

183
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,920
I know, laugh all you want, but there's a huge audience for that stuff.

184
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,400
Let's see if we can hook someone from the States on the Voice Mail line.

185
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:48,320
One, two, one, six, two, one, six, three, five, seven, one, one, two, one, six, two, five, six, three, five, seven.

186
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,320
And we've got to brush with greatness.

187
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
Hey, Adam.

188
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,840
It's out to us here from Rodondo Beach.

189
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,960
I am listening to DSC 516 here in Patricia.

190
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,480
And this is her open funny.

191
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,280
We're briefly and on the give a half-for-half talking about how big it is in the UK.

192
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,320
So, friend of mine, what I work with is woman, she, she's a teacher like me, but she

193
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:17,960
moonlight, that can be at the chart out in Rodondo Beach.

194
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,520
And that's where the half was last night, where the baby's sophomore yet, looking out

195
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:28,280
over the Pacific Ocean, drinking, tower greener, nothing fancy.

196
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:35,080
She said he was on his best behavior, so, you know, out of his eyes as issues with the

197
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,680
deaf holes Jews, but I guess he was on his best behavior last night.

198
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,360
So, all right, keep up the good work, Merry Christmas at the holidays.

199
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,360
Good, baby.

200
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,360
Thank you.

201
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,520
I love it when you send in to brush with greatness, looking for more of those, also from

202
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
the UK.

203
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,400
Remember, you got to put these numbers in yourself on it.

204
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,000
Don't forget the plus before them for easy access.

205
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:03,200
Plus, four, four, two, oh, seven, six, eight, one, three, seven, five, three, plus, four, four,

206
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:12,120
two, oh, seven, six, eight, one, three, seven, five, three.

207
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:19,360
You're on a black magic motion, to rock this mother out.

208
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:26,360
You're on a feast, don't bend that girl to try to cowbell out.

209
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:35,280
Now, let's all give a nod to the heart and work in the Lord, you're just in time.

210
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just in time.

211
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,840
Yo, what's up, AC?

212
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,360
This Jersey tide, the official musicologist of the Chacha.

213
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:49,280
Hey, every once in a while a band comes up on the Pod Save Music Network, that absolutely

214
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,200
blows at me away, and it makes it absolutely impossible for me to give you any other choice

215
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,000
for you to play on Fubar Friday.

216
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,560
Well, it's happened again this week.

217
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,280
This week, I'm bringing you the band's stereo file out of Brisbane, Australia.

218
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,440
They're on their way to LA to work with some of the team that put the Red Hot Chili

219
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,120
Peppers last down together.

220
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,120
And if this song super flies any indication, this band has got a crazy future ahead of them.

221
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,520
