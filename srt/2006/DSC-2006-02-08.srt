Payman Paris in 94.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, was it 95?

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
She was best studying abroad.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
He was on tour.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Playing in another dime.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
They potted hard and they potted wings.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
A little north of the sand.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He dreamed about her in so many ways.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
She dreamed about her in French.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Well, she knows what to do with my call.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
She knows how to make him feel.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That is the one.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He's another son, not like anyone.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Just needs time to heal.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
They met in New York a few months later.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He was still living alone.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Hugging the ball and masturbating.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Never answered his phone.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Never's date was a movie together.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Outside it Brian Pock.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And the spirit of St. Louis just went on forever.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So they drank wine until they saw stars.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh, she knows what to do with my call.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That is the one.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He's another son, not like anyone.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Just needs time to heal.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:19,000
They finally hooked up for the first time.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
When night before the Fourth of July.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
They finally hooked up for the first time.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
When night before the Fourth of July.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He fell so awkward saying goodbye to the girl who just changed his life.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Now my friend, they are in separate bars.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
She even gets that boy to go to the gym.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Now if you don't think that's love, you must be cynical.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh, make a man, you're just dreaming in French.

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah, because she knows what to do with my call.

He's another son, not like anyone.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Just needs time to heal.

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Well, she knows what to do with my call.

84
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,680

85
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,600
you know or don't play your promo i just look i'm doing this by myself here i've got no

86
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,840
producer you know my content has always been what i'm doing you should be able to do at home

87
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,600
that's why for the longest time we stayed away from uh... outboard gear uh... that's how

88
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,480
cast blaster came to life i'm using cast blaster as we speak yeah i've got a i'm ninety

89
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,440
dollar mixer that have attached to it and fifty dollar microphone uh... and uh... what is it

90
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:08,000
uh... like a forty dollar uh... preamp for the mic but really you should be able to do all

91
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,680
this stuff at home um... and of course with that comes the knowledge that i don't

92
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,840
as no way i can manage all of that and you know the show i try to keep the show around forty

93
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,320
minutes and even that's really really hard because it's just too much good stuff so don't take

94
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:29,920
it personally do please yes today i had a uh... uh... community test

95
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:36,800
listening to uh... what was the song uh... it was brother love uh... and my question was when i

96
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,800
heard brother love

97
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,280
say right uh... right stage right stage left right and you know state center stage

98
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,520
it was reversed on my headphones

99
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,160
yeah i got some good feedback on that one

100
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,120
starting off with window to the magic dot com

101
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,720
Paul jberry says all were correct in my end you must have had your ears on backwards

102
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,080
yeah

103
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,800
possible although doesn't the wire i'm i'm i'm using a pair of what are these oops sorry

104
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,000
jvc noise cancelling stereo headphones and i look to see if there was an r

105
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,920
or an l and there's not so i automatically presume

106
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,760
that the wire goes down the left hand side that may just be a uh... a right-handed person thing

107
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,720
as quansitoli points out

108
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,000
they man the headphone with the r goes on your right-yet

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,320
the l goes on the left

110
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,600
i learned this from podcast four on one or was it quit

111
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,080
with the producer from the quansitoli connection quaza totally connection

112
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,760
it's quansit or quaza

113
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,840
even misspelled it okay

114
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,200
uh...

115
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,240
yeah don't know but in in general uh... all the reports i got said that my system was configured

116
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,120
correctly

117
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,760
james chaplain said uh... hey must be a uk thing driving on the wrong side you know

118
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,880
here in Canada

119
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,880
to the left was left to the right was right and center stage was right in the middle

120
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,200
it helps when i listen to delta cia charlie and dobe digital five dot one on my home

121
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,320
pc

122
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,960
could we actually do something with that can i actually create

123
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,520
uh... surround sound and p threes

124
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,520
uh... or do you have to have something special for that i don't know anything about

125
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,760
uh... uh... about five dot one yeah i mean i've witnessed it watching movies and five dot

126
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,120
one is amazing

127
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,320
um... i don't know if you can do that with it with mp threes and with podcasting

128
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,040
and i really don't know if the five dot one gives you any

129
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,800
advantage other than a whole bunch of speakers

130
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,720
exciting day today it is the last day of the rocket boom auction on ebay

131
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,680
if you haven't been up to speed on this rocket boom

132
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,040
at rocket boom dot com which is of course uh... the daily video podcast uh...

133
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,040
uh... it uh... it's produced by Andrew and uh... hosted

134
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,760
by Amanda kongden

135
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,640
uh... they're trying a new model for advertising and they's they put up a

136
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,000
basically an offer uh... four five days a week long of a commercial running at the

137
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,440
end of rocket boom uh... with uh... i don't

138
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,920
the kind of guarantee uh...

139
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,280
one was it was a one million or two million i think two million impressions

140
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,760
let me just double check for a second yeah

141
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,040
uh... no one million one million views

142
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,280
over the course of a week

143
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,160
and you can bid on that now they have a reserve

144
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,200
which means you know there's a number they have in their head which at least has to

145
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,600
be reached before anyone gets anything

146
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,440
current bid fourteen thousand nine hundred ninety nine dollars and ninety nine

147
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,720
cents just under the fifteen grand

148
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,000
which would essentially mean in uh... advertiser terms a fifteen dollar cpm if it

149
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,160
were actually to go for that but of course

150
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,600
there's the creation of the spot you know the production of that is all included in uh...

151
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,360
in the price so i think the price would be a little bit a little bit lower

152
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,920
uh... let's see who the last bitters are eighty nine bid

153
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,680
so far highest bidder is dave taxes these are these are real e-bayers there's no

154
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,720
doubt about it five percent card dot com

155
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,600
uh... oh wow this is kind of exciting five percent card dot com had the the bid

156
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,840
uh... just before the the latest bid and bid fourteen thousand nine nine nine

157
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,600
nine then day from texas came in with ninety nine cents above that i wonder

158
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,840
if the reserve is fifteen thousand

159
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,560
personally i think it's higher i think they're probably more on

160
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,480
twenty or twenty five thousand

161
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,160
dollars

162
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,520
for the highest bid

163
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,760
uh... but it's the sea one day uh... where i am at right now

164
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,000
recording this podcast time left on the auction one day four hours fifty six minutes

166
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,040
uh...

167
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,720
i don't know tomorrow on this time at least we'll have we'll be at just hours away from the

168
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,240
closing bid so

169
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,120
and see if uh... if this actually gets sold or not it's exciting stuff i'm really curious

170
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,160
and of course the thing that i like most about all this is

171
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,400
that it is not traditional advertiser bidding on this stuff it's uh...

172
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,640
it's internet companies and and ebay people who of course have our you know by

173
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,880
themselves great entrepreneurs lot of these power sellers

174
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,280
right now

175
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,160
now let's talk about the card the cartoon controversy

176
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,880
one second my uh... i set up a screen saver on my uh... on my laptop that's running

177
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,240
cast blaster

178
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,880
and it's kicking into façade

179
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,840
having to log in again okay there we go

180
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,600
um...

181
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,600
yesterday i i started uh... i'll just call out a conversation amongst ourselves here

182
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,520
listening to the source code about

183
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,680
these cartoons that were published and the outrage that ensued and the violence that

184
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,880
came from that

185
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,520
and uh... i'm not seeing a lot of newspapers respond to this i think that they're

186
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,440
well but actually let's talk about all of that let's take it in order though

187
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,000
since i started the conversation yesterday i received just a ton of amazing

188
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,920
comments feedback most of them written most of them very very lengthy pointers to

189
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,880
websites of uh...

190
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,880
Muslim community leaders uh... i really learned an incredible amount

191
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,720
and you know and it's so hard you know because religion is something that is so easy

192
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,520
to interpret and of course throughout history has been misused for many many evil

193
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,400
causes

194
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:14,640
but in general i of course believe that any religion is based in uh... in love and understanding

195
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,760
and togetherness and uh... and saying otherwise just doesn't make sense because that

196
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,320
goes against i think human nature you want people to believe in something

197
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,200
good and positive and i believe that the founders of these religions of all religions

198
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,440
basically have that had that in mind with some lessons to

199
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,600
to live live a healthier life by

200
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
uh... i'd like to take

201
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,680
uh... religion out of this equation though because i think that's where we're messing up

202
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,640
and this audio comment that came from a 14-year-old listener to the source code

203
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:54,240
really put a lot of things into perspective when i'm talking about uh... islam

204
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,440
uh... the faith of islam uh... Muslims

205
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,800
so we can take this part of the story out and really talk about what i feel is going on

206
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
so i want to play this comment first

207
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,400
and this is mkp from the mkp show and pseudon use at mkp media dot net and i wanted to

208
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,640
comment on the Denmark editorial cartoons

209
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:20,000
i'm pressing one to clear up is that there is no law that says that uh... insulting the

210
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,400
proper moment based upon him uh...

211
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,000
anybody doing that should be killed there's no law that says that still shouldn't be done

212
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
but uh... killing is nowhere in there

213
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,560
but second is that uh... what it is that there's so angry about

214
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,680
is not only uh... religion being insulted uh... want to say they uh... i mean these people who

215
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,640
who are uh... hearing of these about that uh... what to say about is that there's a lot

216
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:48,080
of the basic says that any profits or uh... so any profits would be like including a

217
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:53,520
home mother Jesus or Moses or Abraham or whoever uh... you're not allowed to have

218
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,200
pictures of them

219
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,240
now

220
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,560
the problem with these people is

221
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,000
they they they're getting mad because uh...

222
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
of something that's going to stop

223
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,680
but they're not going about it

224
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,720
islamically so they're being kind of hypocritical

225
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,040
in the summer the wouldn't

226
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,960
a more one violent

227
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,240
is not part of the religion at all uh...

228
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,120
in fact the these you know the way of screaming people in the summer is a salamolica

229
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,040
which means peace be upon you

230
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,880
and there's no violence uh... anywhere in the prudon

231
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,560
so they're not going about it is something they at all i mean people in Denmark

232
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,520
they the cartoonists didn't know about this rule

233
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,440
besides the fact that he still did something they shouldn't have done regardless of

234
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,880
the rule or not

235
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,400
uh... being there but

236
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,760
he didn't know about it so the salamolica doing it would be

237
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,600
no writing a letter or even publicly doing it you know telling him and telling

238
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,640
everyone

239
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,480
straight out that that's not allowed and just asked for an apology i'm sure they would

240
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,920
in a realizing what they did

241
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,720
and so all this violence that kind of breaking a hundred

242
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,120
is some rules uh... because of one

243
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,880
which doesn't make sense at all

244
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,560
now the problem

245
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,080
with uh...

246
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,840
i think it's a word west but

247
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,000
the west is uh... doing

248
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,040
is that the whole comic was just

249
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,200
not it has nothing to do with freedom of speech was just

250
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,040
and it's kind of like if you started being racist on your show right now it doesn't

251
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,240
make sense it's not allowed doesn't matter whether freedom of speech or not

252
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
thinks something like a blank

253
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,760
that skin color people are stupid or something so

254
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,040
before bashing

255
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,640
uh... any religion

256
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,640
you should try and learn about a verse now another thing that i just want to come

257
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,520
down is

258
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,200
a lot of people are stuck on the whole seventy two versions thing

259
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,640
that's taken out of context and if you're going to look going to the

260
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,840
Quran

261
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,040
just read more than one sentence is all i have to say

262
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,880
uh... i'm sure that there's this online search engine thing where you can search

263
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,680
inside the Quran go ahead and search for that

264
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,960
the absurd it's in some other context because i've read it before but i'm

265
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,320
feeling it right now

266
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,880
most of the suicide bombers aren't considered martyrs in the song

267
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,280
uh... they're not considered to be people dying for their religion

268
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,120
oh yeah and one more thing i've never heard you say the word

269
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,520
fundamentalist or extremist on your show

270
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,480
but uh... just for your listeners uh... the term

271
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,880
fundamentalist uh... most of them

272
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,440
in the world in a mainstream media is

273
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,120
considered to be a violent person who you know is a terrorist or something

274
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,000
and uh... that doesn't actually make any sense there's no

275
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
violence anywhere in the religion the fundamentals of his uh... or actually

276
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,840
a prayer charity the book of rich to record once in your lifetime

277
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,200
fasting

278
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,800
in uh... the month of the month and uh... fame that's nothing

279
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,600
so no one there's violence

280
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,840
and uh... you know just i don't know that because i kind of hate it when i'm watching

281
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,360
news and something they say

282
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,240
extremist or fundamentalists is that makes no sense

283
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,560
that's like calling hill or an extreme catholic or something it's uh...

284
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,160
anyway so this comes getting really long i hope you can play this on your show

285
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,440
to clear up some confusion with people and uh...

286
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,560
took my podcasts and empty media dot net uh...

287
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,560
i don't do religious podcasts but they're on a gaming attack and check

288
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,320
them out to good podcasts and uh... if you ever have any questions about

289
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,960
this time just uh... just email me at mkp show at gmail dot com

290
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,320
uh... to the police will be guaranteed no burn absentees

291
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,880
and uh... by the way your camera was off by around five seconds yesterday i think

292
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,360
anyway uh... good luck with our show

293
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,360
and by

294
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
right on okay

295
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,040
so that is the the youth the youthful voice of his long and i think it's very clear

296
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,480
so

297
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,000
obviously the demonstration to we saw the violence we saw

298
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,800
was not burned down by hundreds of millions of muslims all around the world it was a

299
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,200
a relatively and i'm just gonna say relatively small group of thousands

300
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,360
maybe ten thousand in total maybe twenty thousand total but it was not millions of

301
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,280
millions so you can't say

302
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,240
and i agree with that you know that saying islam fundamentalists that's all

303
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,400
crap these are just trouble makers is what it is led by trouble makers

304
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,840
some other facts i learned from uh... email that came in

305
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,400
and this is something that uh... and i read three newspapers a day i watch uh... the

306
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,240
BBC news

307
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,920
um... there's so much that i want you know the background of this has never been

308
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,560
clearly explained to me

309
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,120
these cartoons apparently appeared

310
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,760
in september of two thousand five and it's taken all this time

311
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,800
uh... and from what i have read and this is from people on the street in

312
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,800
denmark and i appreciate people from denmark getting into the conversation

313
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,640
audio feedback would be even better obviously

314
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,480
but you know this was something that was uh... i think there were a few cartoons that were

315
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,360
published uh...

316
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,720
several people took this back to their country

317
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,600
uh... excuse me i'll give you download dot i give you dot com

318
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,680
uh... taken back to uh... their countries and their communities and start up

319
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,080
shit with it and apparently allegedly also using other cartoons that were

320
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,520
may not even have been published by any publication whatsoever

321
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,960
now i'm just gonna make a presumption here uh... i have been to scandinavia i've

322
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,600
not been to denmark uh... but i i've always uh...

323
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,560
thought that the Netherlands Holland is kind of uh... you know like a backup scandinavia

324
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,000
if you will it's it's they're they're not they're not that far apart really uh... in

325
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,560
geographic distance and i think the makeup of the countries may be very similar as

326
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,480
well you know you of course you have a

327
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,240
a language which is a pretty isolated you know where in the world do we speak

328
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,640
Danish you know we speak it in denmark uh... Dutch is the same way where do you speak

329
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,920
Dutch well maybe uh... a little bit of south african because it kind of is derived from it

330
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,920
but it's really in the Netherlands so you know with the media explosion that we've seen

331
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,600
in the past years uh... in the Netherlands there are like 15 commercial television stations

332
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,440
you know there's uh... an equal amount of commercial radio stations there's newspapers

333
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,160
everyone's fighting and jockeying for position and i'm and please in denmark let me know

334
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:13,360
i'm just gonna make a guess that most newspaper publications uh... our sensationalist

335
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:19,040
and uh... they love to publish it that gets shit stirred up uh... because that's that's and

336
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:24,720
it's not you know it's it's not that this is politically motivated it's in their DNA it's part

337
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,960
of their survival this is you know this is what the news media have discovered

338
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,160
is if they want to survive they need ratings ratings are based upon uh... people watching

339
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:40,160
people watching is based upon emotions the easiest emotion that is you pretty much the

340
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:46,320
same uniform reaction in just about every human being is fear joy is different uh...

341
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,480
love can be experienced differently but fear i think is pretty universal and that's what they

342
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,000
and you can't even blame them for it you know this just it's stupidity and

343
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,880
has nothing to do with journalism anymore so let me know if that's true i'm just going to

344
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,920
going to presume that now you probably also are a very

345
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,760
peaceful loving nation which the Dutch are as well and i'm just drawing these analogies you know

346
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,400
by the way people get uh... the Netherlands and and denmark infused all the time particularly

347
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:25,200
people in the u.s. hey you speak Dutch you're from Denmark um i'm i'm i'm going to also think

348
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,640
that because of uh you know i don't know what the history of the recent history is of your government

349
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,240
but you probably have had a version of what in the united states we'd call affirmative action

350
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,960
this is what i saw uh what i realized in the Netherlands after having been gone for 15 years and we

351
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:47,120
move back five years ago and stayed for a couple years is that uh immigration policy was completely

352
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,800
mishandled uh people came in from the east i'm just gonna say from the east because it doesn't

353
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,040
matter what their religion is they came in from the east with their own culture and we're not

354
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:05,680
asked to adapt to and to integrate into the Dutch culture on any level not even uh learning to

355
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,560
speak the language now if you're in the u.s you know and my wife had to go through this

356
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,520
too Patricia uh when you when you want to come to united states you want to live there you have to

357
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,280
pass a test and it sounds really stupid and trivial but you know what it does work and you know

358
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,960
you just learn a little bit of history national history um you have to be able to conduct that

359
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,160
i believe you have to be able to conduct that uh the test in English um and you have to prove you know

360
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,320
you just have to prove that you're uh uh a contributing citizen to society and then you're more

361
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,600
than welcome which of course is the entire you know the entire foundation of the united states

362
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,920
and their immigration policy and many of the countries that are now overrun by uh i think i

363
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:56,400
truly believe people running from the hills in uh in the middle east where uh their life is just you

364
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,240
know nowhere compared to what they think life could be look if you don't think they don't see

365
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,440
television or see pictures or there's no underground stream of information then of course your

366
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,520
mistaken you know go to Baghdad dude that's a western city people walking around with mobiles you know

367
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,760
it's this is not you know this is not all sticks and cave stuff oh man people on serious satellite

368
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,480
stars 103 i'm so sorry you can't listen to the rest of this conversation at least not now

369
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,320
go to dailysourceco.com when you get to the officer home and listen to the rest of it because our

370
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:36,080
satellite window is closed there you go now let us continue here so i think there's probably some

371
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:41,680
kind of version of affirmative action i saw this happening in the Netherlands and when people start to

372
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:50,160
not even test their rights but just express their opinions and and i'm not getting into a legal

373
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,440
freedom of expression freedom of speech thing just a human thing people like to express their

374
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:02,240
emotions their anger their outrage whatever the best example in the Netherlands is i can't really

375
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,880
call in my friend but i was an active colleague of his up until just weeks before he was he was murder

376
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:18,560
tail fanghoh Dutch filmmaker descendant of Vincent fanghoh who created with money from the Dutch

377
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:29,360
state by the way co-funded created a piece of expressionistic art in the form of film

378
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:38,960
about how the islam treats i'm sorry i shouldn't have said that how how women are treated

379
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,880
often in name of the coroner islam maybe that's a better way to put it because it it you know it was

380
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:55,280
totally an expressionist piece and what happened to tail is he was gunned down from his bicycle

381
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:03,840
in the middle of Amsterdam after just having done some shopping and then a note with the other

382
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:10,560
people who would be killed was stabbed into his chest with the notes the note was stabbed

383
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:22,320
into his chest right in his heart and they got the guy and he's currently going through the

384
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,080
legal system there's no death penalty in the Netherlands and no one's calling for it either

385
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,720
but the uh the way that this has been handled publicly i think is is quite poor

386
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,760
and that comes back to the you know this whole idea of almost affirmative action you know and

387
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:45,200
and tiptoeing around stuff because oh my god and maybe this is it oh my god we don't want to

388
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,400
piss off the entire nation of Islam we don't want to piss off all Muslims guess what guys you

389
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,960
want this is what i've come to realize you know there are people misusing religion i've done

390
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,960
so with christian gym with Judaism you name it for their own good for their own preservation for their

391
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:09,520
own advancement and and cracking down really hard on people who do this kind of stuff who

392
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,680
who use violence in any manner in any manner doesn't matter who you are or what you believe

393
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:20,160
and or the color of your skin it's unacceptable in our society and we need to stand up for that

394
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:28,720
and make it known embassies which were attacked as far as i know our sovereign territory

395
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,960
of the countries they represent so if you go to a US embassy or if you go to a Danish embassy

396
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:42,400
you were actually standing on Danish territory attacks against these buildings are of course

397
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:48,560
an attack against the country now i'm not too worried about you know a couple people shooting

398
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:53,520
AK-47s into the air and pelting buildings with eggs but when you start to burn it down you've

399
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,240
got to come out you got to come out and force you got to kick these guys ass and don't be afraid

400
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,400
because the entire nation of Islam and the entire population that is Muslim will not come and say

401
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:10,320
oh you can't do that you have to crack down on that stuff where's NATO in this is is then

402
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:16,720
mark a member of NATO aren't they mean come on what's going on with these leaders it's not

403
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:25,440
it's only a few thousand people it really isn't millions and hundreds of millions and i think we

404
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,520
just have to realize it you know look at cops you know there's no discrimination

405
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:35,520
between who's being picked up yeah you can say oh it's cops and black people it's cops and white

406
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,840
trash it's cops and this and it doesn't matter it's people who are doing bad things who need

407
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:47,360
it serious attitude adjustment now what is what is the the thickest to all this of course i don't

408
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:53,120
know i can only look back to history to see what has been done in the past and it could very well

409
00:28:53,120 --> 00:29:00,080
mean that the multicultural society will just have to become a reality whether we like it or not

410
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:07,440
because we only have really two ways to go i think that there's just millions of people who want

411
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,200
to leave the east and come west this is not the first time this happened this happened in the

412
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,120
Roman Empire too and they overran the the Roman Empire and not that they over overran and pillaged

413
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:23,120
and plundered it was too many people for the infrastructure to support it you know and now

414
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:29,120
where we have great social security and not everywhere but in many places there's great social

415
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:35,920
security there's facilities there's just no way you know you can't have 10% of the population

416
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:41,760
paying taxes to support the other 90% so there has to be a balance there so i think we can go with

417
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:49,600
complete lockdown nationalism close off every borders no way you're not coming in i think that is

418
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:58,400
probably not going to work then of course you could open it all up and let anybody come in

419
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,120
under certain rules and right now we're somewhere in the middle and it's and it's kind of not

420
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:12,640
clear and and i really don't know myself which which way i i think we should we should play it

421
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,920
everyone i'd speak to in the UK and in other countries in europe just say hey you know we don't want

422
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:25,680
any immigrants doesn't matter where they're coming from which of course is not true because they let

423
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,680
me in so let that be some food for thought for today and let's try and just take the

424
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:37,680
religious part out of the equation let's take the freedom of speech freedom of expression let's take

425
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:44,320
that all out of the equation this is just about people communicating and dealing with other people

426
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,600
i don't speak Arabic by the way i have no idea what people are saying half the time and what they're

427
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,760
all pissed off about so it's very hard to take things in context i just cannot i can no longer

428
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:01,360
trust newspapers or news media to tell me really what's going on i've learned so much directly from

429
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:08,800
people direct contact and if you want a yelling shout let's do that let's yell on shout if you want

430
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:15,920
a right nasty things if you want to create video shows where you say horrible things i'm really i'm

431
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:21,040
really okay with that because you know that's a level playing field that everyone can work with

432
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:31,200
oh boy you know we sometimes i think it's like what are we living in in some kind of special

433
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,960
time but if you see what's happened in history this is this is so not new this is just so not new

434
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:45,600
and i really hope we can get over this and just move on it would be nice but uh you know if

435
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:51,040
someone's gonna burn your house down you gotta go kick their ass it's just that simple and that's the

436
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:58,640
only way someone will learn but let's not do it with words of my laptop just go to sleep let's just

437
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:06,960
you know let's not be pussy footing around with stuff okay let's let's really let's really make a plan

438
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,480
and let people know in each individual country what is and what is not acceptable and just take

439
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,760
the religious part out of the equation please i'm tired of it oh my goodness okay hope that

440
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,720
made some sense it's it's it's it's such a tough topic to approach and just kind of doing a

441
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,120
brain dump on you hope you don't mind i'd love to hear back from you because of course it's just my

442
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:48,960

443
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,240
bit slow to play let me see if i can do this again hold on a second what the hell happened there that

Huddled with her mother, brother and infant son on a roof to keep canaveral.

470
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,160
Along with the assembled families of the six other challenger astronauts about to blast off in the space,

she thought the rumble of lift off and huddled baby closer in the cold.

What do you mean, mom? Ask her son. They're lost, she replied.

476
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,160
I know they are. The from framing him Massachusetts, a rare child with Grace Corrigan.

477
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,160
Mother of the late christmas call off.

478
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,160
They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths.

479
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:48,160
They wished to serve and they did it. They served all of us, the guests, Glenn Loney.

480
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,160
Jones, go be Rogers.

481
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,160
Lorna, onizuka.

482
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,160
The crap they're even seen is a major malfunction.

483
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,160
Totally years after Challenger, we shall see you.

484
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,160
Mad Dog, don't kill him.

485
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,160
Holy, holy, holy garbage heap, man.

486
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,160
That's madpod.com.

487
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,160
New member of the pod show podcast network, man.

488
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,160
It sounds really produced. This whole Challenger special.

489
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,160
Definitely going to check that out.

490
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,160
I don't know what's going on with Castblast. It's kind of weird.

491
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,160
Normally, I'll start up the program fresh each day and of course,

492
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,160
it remembers what I had the previous day.

493
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,160
But now I didn't do that today and I think I made a mistake.

494
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,160
It sounds like the sample rates are getting kind of mixed up.

495
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,160
Let me try one more promo here.

496
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,160
See if it works.

497
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,160
Hey Adam.

498
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,160
Chef Tom here in Chicago.

499
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:44,160
I'm a chef teacher chef and teacher who teaches cooking and specifically

500
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,160
baking at the cooking and hospitality institute of Chicago.

501
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,160
I've been providing baking information on the web for about the last eight years

502
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,160
through my website Let's Bake with Chef Tom.

503
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,160
I've recently added podcasting.

504
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,160
The chic podcast.

505
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,160
See HIC.

506
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,160
What I really love to do is bake bread.

507
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,160
You love bread.

508
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,160
I don't just love the crunch of fresh crusty bread.

509
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,160
I thought so.

510
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,160
We talk about sweet, sweet, but savory food every episode.

511
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,160
Don't you want to know how to bake?

512
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,160
Do you want to know why stuff works?

513
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,160
Or in some case cases doesn't.

514
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,160
I talk food science with some of the other instructors to our school.

515
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,160
We have episodes coming up about ice cream, cookies, and chocolate breads.

516
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,160
Mmm.

517
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:32,160
Check us out at Let's Bake. Frostbitten.org for the chic podcast.

518
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,160
Thanks for checking us out.

519
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,160
You're on.

520
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,160
Another chef hits the pod waves.

521
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,160
Groovy.

522
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,160
I like cooking podcasts.

523
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,160
Of course, I like to pretend I can cook.

524
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,160
And Patricia's really good at it.

525
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,160
Chef Tom, thank you very much.

526
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,160
So I think I've found a momentary solution around this cast blaster thing that's going on.

527
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,160
I basically reloaded all the clips that I'm going to play and they seem to be working fine now.

528
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:04,160
That's kind of a message for cast blaster mic because he needs to know what I'm doing when shit goes wrong.

529
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,160
Just a couple of brief things here.

530
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,160
First of all, there's a new geek brief out.

531
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,160
geek brief.podshow.com.

532
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,160
Callie, bringing you all the latest gadgets.

533
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,160
Dude.

534
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,160
Callie, looking good.

535
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,160
She changes wardrobe in the latest show.

536
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,160
And I like it.

537
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,160
Very, very cool.

538
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,160
And I got a cool email from podshow headquarters yesterday at him.

539
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,160
I was going to mention something about this the other day, but thought otherwise.

540
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,160
But as you brought it up again today, I had to warn you.

541
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,160
You may or may not know me.

542
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:42,160
But I'm working at the San Francisco office, and if just about completed a player for the podcast,

543
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,160
I think music network.

544
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,160
By the way, I think we're going to throw that into beta on Thursday.

545
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,160
No damn announcements.

546
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
Of course I know who you are Kevin.

547
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,160
Aren't you the guy they call Kevin Oz?

548
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,160
Unfortunately, we haven't met in person, but I will.

549
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,160
And we can have from now.

550
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,160
The reason for my emails this, I have many relatives and friends in the UK.

551
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,160
And one of them known for driving like a maniac has been driving like a little

552
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,160
lady for three years there now.

553
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:11,160
The reason there are many cameras all around the motorways that snap photos of

554
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,160
speeders.

555
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,160
In the Netherlands, there are quite a few.

556
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,160
And I've been tagged there, but in the UK, they are ubiquitous.

557
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,160
So forget about 90.

558
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,160
Don't even think about 80.

559
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,160
Once you're aware of them, you'll notice them everywhere.

560
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,160
I do have that built in warning system.

561
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,160
I have to admit.

562
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,160
And I think they all are kind of painted orange.

563
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
So you can see them.

564
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,160
But yeah, they're not, of course.

565
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
These are speed traps.

566
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,160
And you know what you guys are right.

567
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,160
And by the way, I'm not a speed freak at all.

568
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,160
I've never been a speed freak.

569
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,160
I've never given a shit about cars.

570
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,160
Really.

571
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,160
And I've had all kinds of cars.

572
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,160
Every stupid car you can imagine, I've had it.

573
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,160
I'm just as happy, tooling around San Francisco and Trinity as I am in the Super V8

574
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,160
Jag here in the UK.

575
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,160
And you're right.

576
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,160
It's ludicrous.

577
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,160
I'm going to keep to the 70.

578
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,160
Yeah, I mean, within 70, 75.

579
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,160
By the way, when I was cruising 90, there were people passing me.

580
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:08,160
So I was just kind of going along with flow in the right hand lane, which, of course, is the passing lane in the UK.

581
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,160
Very, very frightening.

582
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,160
And if I want to get somewhere fast, hey, the solution is there for me.

583
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,160
Delta's share.

584
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,160
I'll just grab the plane.

585
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,160
There's enough airports here in the UK.

586
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,160
So I appreciate all of you concerned for my safety and that of my family.

587
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,160
Okay, some pod safe music coming up.

588
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,160
A brand new one.

589
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,160
At least brand new to me.

590
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,160
It's been on the network for a while.

591
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,160
But first something very important.

592
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:37,160
If you create a music show that uses pod safe music, we're a looking for you.

593
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,160
Yes, we are.

594
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:48,160
In September of 05, we made landfall with the seven headed monster known as pod show music rewind.

595
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:56,160
The weekly compilation featuring the best independent music from the best independent music podcasts.

596
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:03,160
If you've got a music podcast, it's time to unleash the monster within you.

597
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:12,160
Now on pod show music rewind, we'll be presenting guest podcaster personalities.

598
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:18,160
Right alongside pod show music podcasts, like the rock and roll geek show, accident hash,

599
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:25,160
the scenes in the roadhouse, and the rest of the pod show music game.

600
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:36,160
And as always, the show is broadcast every week on Sarah Stars channel 1003, part of Adam Curry's pod show.

601
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:46,160
Just submit a podcast clip featuring pod safe music of any style or genre to pod show music rewind at gmail.com.

602
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:53,160
All clips should feature songs from the pod safe music network and be no greater than five minutes in length.

603
00:42:53,160 --> 00:43:01,160
Submit your clip today and you could be included on the next episode of pod show music rewind.

604
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:06,160
Check us out online at rewind.podshow.com.

605
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,160
Now that's exactly how a network is supposed to work and is supposed to come together.

606
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:17,160
I love it, so you're shot at promoting your show through the pod show music rewind.

607
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:22,160
Here's my shot that I guess coming around, poddle of dreams on the source code.

608
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:41,160
I love my shot, my house in my wife, this place my edge, my keys in my life.

609
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:51,160
I can't breathe yet, to make it again I have to find out just wherever I've been.

610
00:43:51,160 --> 00:44:02,160
But I'm happy, and seeing the blue's got the clothes on my back, and got nothing to lose.

611
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:10,160
Still got my friends, for sharing some food, just a little bit.

612
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:25,160
And seeing the blue's got the blue's got the blue's.

613
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,160
Ain't got no more.

614
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,160
No hope on no gas, just one wetting ring.

615
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:38,160
And I can't get my nails out of the floor.

616
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:46,160
No I don't need anything, just some good friends, and this bottle of dreams.

617
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:56,160
And I'm happy, and seeing the blue's got the clothes on my back, and got nothing to lose.

618
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:09,160
Still got my friends, for sharing some food, just a little bit.

619
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:19,160
Still got my friends, for sharing some food, just a little bit.

620
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:29,160
Still got my friends, for sharing some food, just a little bit.

621
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:43,160
Still got my friends, for sharing some food, just a little bit.

622
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:51,160
Still got my friends, for sharing some food, just a little bit.

623
00:45:51,160 --> 00:46:02,160
And seeing the blue's got the clothes on my back, and got nothing to lose.

624
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:10,160
Still got my friends, for sharing some food, just a little bit.

625
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:25,160
And seeing the blue's got the clothes on my back, and got nothing to lose.

626
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:34,160
Still got my friends, for sharing some food, just a little bit.

627
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:44,160
Still got my friends, for sharing some food, just a little bit.

628
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:54,160
Still got my friends, for sharing some food, just a little bit.

629
00:46:54,160 --> 00:47:05,160
Still got my friends, for sharing some food, just a little bit.

630
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:15,160
Still got my friends, for sharing some food, just a little bit.

631
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:26,160
Still got my friends, for sharing some food, just a little bit.

632
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:44,160
Still got my friends, for sharing some food, just a little bit.

633
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:54,160
Still got my friends, for sharing some food, just a little bit.

634
00:47:54,160 --> 00:48:04,160
Still got my friends, for sharing some food, just a little bit.

635
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:16,160
I believe tomorrow we will finally be able to open up the beta test of purchasing free and clear MP3s through the pod save music network.

636
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:28,160
You'll be able to do it with a credit card from anywhere in the world, as far as I'm aware, of course if that turns out to be different, I'm sure you'll let me know.

637
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:44,160
I think we'll have one song to test with, and the idea here was to make pod save for peace with every day we're Christmas, to make that the test song.

638
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:50,160
The reason being, obviously, is that all the proceeds of that song go to UNICEF.

639
00:48:50,160 --> 00:49:01,160
So you can help beta test and all the proceeds go to UNICEF except for nine cents, which is paid for the transaction, which is out of our hands.

640
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:10,160
We're not going to take any money during this beta period, and obviously nothing is going to anyone else except for UNICEF.

641
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:18,160
And SLOW is managing all that. So we're going to use that as the test song, and you'll be able to basically try it out.

642
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:27,160
And then I think it'll be as simple as artists just checking a box saying, make this song available and you'll be able to buy it for download MP3 free and clear.

643
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:35,160
It's a concept here. This is not a store people. This is a part of the unlabel. This is a part of, well, this is a part of something new.

644
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:47,160
That what comes into account here is trust and support of independent artists. That's really what this is all about. And hopefully it'll be successful test.

645
00:49:47,160 --> 00:50:02,160
Also tomorrow, and I'm just going to start warning you now. I believe I'm going to try out the DGAP system of the PDN. Now DGAP, another fine acronym stands for dynamically generated audio placement,

646
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:11,160
which enables insertion of tags, promos, and, of course, advertisements in Earthlink.

647
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:20,160
How's the D program going, by the way? Is it working with you guys? Are we messing up enough? No more anchors to send CO?

648
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:30,160
So the reason I'm warning you is that files may come in name differently. There could be different date structures. It may not work at all.

649
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:37,160
You know, any type of things you notice, I'd be very happy to hear from you regarding that, and obviously bear with us.

650
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:44,160
Well, this is what Daley's source code has always been about it. This is where we test it all. This is where we break stuff. And that's why it's every day.

651
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:49,160
Because if it's broken today, well, we'll probably have it fixed by tomorrow. And I'll see you tomorrow.

652
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,160
