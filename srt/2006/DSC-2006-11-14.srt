Oh, we're headed straight for....

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:18,840
We had it straight for the hit parade, it's on the pod save music network and music.potshot.com.

47
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,840
or you could go to potshot.com and click on music and you get a whole new kind of potsate music experience.

48
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,240
And after I checked yesterday, indeed the buy buttons will be showing up in the players.

49
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,160
And actually those will be the embeddable players will have the buy button linked right into it.

50
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,160
So you can help out your band, your favorite band, just if you're a fan or if you have a band,

51
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,800
buy embedding the player with the band songs. Of course, we pony up for the band with and all that stuff.

52
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,360
Of the 99 cents, 90 cents goes to the artist, 9 cents in transaction fees. We just want people to enjoy.

53
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:58,040
There's some major work going on in the background today here at the Curry Cottage in the affluent suburb of Surrey, known as Gilford.

54
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,040
You hear it there? Actually, it's not that bad right now. It was really bad early on like I was going to.

55
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,640
It's just, it was just par for the mood that I'm in. I had words with Christina this morning on the way to school because

56
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:16,600
it went those big teenager, you know, just a big mouth, you know what I mean? Then and she

57
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,600
sometimes she just forgets that, you know, if you say it in a normal tonal voice, it's okay, you know,

58
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:31,800
she gets so defensive. It really it really throws me off whack when when I'm with my daughter

59
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,480
after saying it just like bugs me for the rest of the day. It hurts me than more than her turn, right?

60
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,040
I guess that's it. Well, once in a while, I just got to say, please don't talk to your mom that way.

61
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,800
Don't talk to me that way. Don't talk to anyone that way. You're not going to get anywhere in life.

62
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,800
And you know what? In the past couple of weeks, I've talked to a lot of grownups who talk like that.

63
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,120
And it's annoying. It really is like no one ever said, hey, shut up.

64
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,040
So as always, when I'm feeling a little bit blue and I just don't know what to do, I reach down

65
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:08,280
deep into the pod safe music bag of tricks. And I come up with this song, which always makes me feel good.

66
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,360
You may sing a lot. You may sing a lot.

67
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,400
Here we go.

68
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:39,640
I think a look at my enormous feelings. And the happy times are coming to stay.

69
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:47,640
I got to sing and I dance when I glancing my pants. I am the feeling like a sunshine he did.

70
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,560
Take a look at how he normates.

71
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,040
Venus and everything is going my way.

72
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,480
Yeah. The Vinci's notebook and my enormous penis from the pod safe music network.

73
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,480
Speaking of which, check this out.

74
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,880
Hey Adam, it's Gizelle from San Diego.

75
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,080
You know, I was thinking about it and I wasn't going to say anything, but I'm on my way to work.

76
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,800
And I just have to tell you, I got really pissed off at you for saying that you thought I was

77
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,280
speaking my last song all to you. I was totally not taking it.

78
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,680
So anyway, I got pissed off and I stopped listening to your show. I have to admit it. I'm sorry.

79
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,920
I stopped listening. And then I saw my ex-boyfriend over the weekend.

80
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,440
Got all horny. Went out with him. I saw a guy that went like you.

81
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,320
I kid you not. He had blonde hair. He wasn't as cute as you, but he did kind of look like you.

82
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:47,240
Totally reminded me of you. And I got all horny again. Went home and, you know,

83
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:55,640
anyway, I made me think about you and I missed you. And I really really want to meet you.

84
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,920
And I really really want to do you. Anyway, if that makes me crazy, then I'm crazy.

85
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:09,240
I just wanted you to know how I felt. And hopefully we can get together someday and get crazy together. Bye.

86
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,120
I wish I had time to use my enormous penis. I certainly have opportunity.

87
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,680
Well, Giselle, I'm sorry. I really, you know, a couple of the people said to me,

88
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,360
they really thought it sounded like you were reading off a piece of paper last time.

89
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,320
So I didn't mean to offend you in that regard. How far is San Diego from San Francisco?

90
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,520
I'm going Sunday. I'm going to be on San Francisco next week.

91
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,960
We don't celebrate Thanksgiving here. So maybe there might be some lost souls to celebrate with

92
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,960
in San Francisco at the office. Giselle, if you want to come

93
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:46,280
celebrate Thanksgiving, then what am I doing?

94
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,240
Hi Adam. I see you still haven't found out to change the message at the beginning of the recording.

95
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:00,040
Okay. I can't live with that. I have a complaint to make. So this pod show plus

96
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,600
unbeater thing that I am currently getting when I try to go to any of the pod show sites.

97
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,760
We interrupt your pod show and be key pod show social media experience for a taste of the

98
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:17,720
plus. Fine. I've had a taste. Now I want to go and look at the shows that I want to go look at.

99
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:24,040
There's no sign on here saying whether this is because of a technical issue or whether this is going to

100
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:30,200
be, you know, try again in an hour. Try again in a couple of days. I'm not liking this dude.

101
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,840
I'm missing my shows. I want them back. Thank you very much.

102
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,040
Hi. Yeah. I apologize for that. What happened was we had an outage yesterday. I'm not

103
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,960
quite sure how long it lasted. I think at least 30 minutes, maybe even an hour and it was like

104
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:50,440
an infrastructure thing. And I've come to learn that, you know, someone says, hey, it's this

105
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,040
and this and this and the infrastructure and that's it. I just wait and then wait from to fix it

106
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,360
and they, they always do. But what happened in that case is automatically

107
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,880
our unleash page rolled over and went live, which of course we had changed for the unleash,

108
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:09,800
which was scheduled downtime. And without a doubt, that page should have changed for this

109
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,920
downtime. But I think that people were just trying to get stuff up in a hurry and didn't want

110
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,160
to bother with with any of the details. But I apologize. That was not the right message.

111
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,880
Absolutely. You mentioned something very interesting there at the beginning of

112
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:28,600
at the beginning of your comment that the phone, the phone lines, the daily source code

113
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,040
voicemail that you call to leave a message. Wait a minute. Those numbers of course.

114
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,600
And that's for if you're in the United States. If you're in the United Kingdom,

115
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
we have a number especially for you.

116
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,040
So I heard something really interesting on the BBC radio one. I think it was a

117
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,200
was the Chris Moile show and I was trying to remember the name of what they called it. I

118
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:24,920
think they called it the date diversion line. It was actually very funny. The concept is you use one

119
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,200
of those phone numbers. Like if you're in the US, you say, hey, you know, call me my US cell phone number

120
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:37,480
is 20665657. And in the UK, you can use the UK number. But since it doesn't have a greeting,

121
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,920
it's kind of undefined like it could be anyone's voice mail. And so if you meet someone

122
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,440
who wants to go out with you or is desperately trying to get a date and ask you for your phone

123
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,840
number, you give them the daily source code number instead. And then when they call in,

124
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,400
we'll play the comments back. We'll play the recordings back or what those people said.

125
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,800
So feel free to do that or anything else you want to do, they are after all your phone line numbers.

126
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:06,040
Hi, I'm Matt and Newton here. Hope I find you well. I just like to comment on the situation

127
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:12,840
or the conversation rather between yourselves and the man and woman who was speaking about

128
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:21,080
Port City PD. I found the conversation fascinating for several reasons, but I just wanted to say that

129
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:29,320
for me the strap line for you also the podcasting is Adam Curry. It's never been true.

130
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:37,160
That conversation, I have no idea why it really hit the spot for me. I think it almost bruised

131
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:44,760
the gap between reality and virtual technology etc. And podcasting and I really think that

132
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:53,880
that's the sort of thing podcasting should be and it really hit the spot for me. The lady that was

133
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:02,680
was speaking, I just want to say to her, you feel a fantastic job and I'm sure you make some

134
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:10,040
fantastic family therapists and just thank you on the last days that you helped. I hope

135
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,200
thank you well and I love to say and keep doing what you did. Take care. Thank you.

136
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,000
Folder? Scruncher? Bet you was a folder. Well, I appreciate the comment and you're right.

137
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:30,040
We do try to keep it civil here on the source. So this is a reference to Susanna Robin from

138
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,080
Inside Works, calling in about the Port City PD promo. And along the way in the conversation

139
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,520
in this back and forth, we've discussed the placement of where's my fucking latte,

140
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,480
which is a fantastic show, which Mark Yoshimoto Namcoff does, you know, from Pacific Coast

141
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:52,120
Hellway. And it's essentially diaries of executive assistance or personal assistance of Hollywood.

142
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,640
So not just of stars, but also of directors, producers, etc. And they're really, really entertaining

143
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:05,560
to listen to. And Robin noticed correctly that the logo for the show had gone from where's my

144
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:13,160
fucking latte to where's my F apostrophe C.K. ING latte. And question the censorship, which we're

145
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:20,040
past that. But luckily Mark Yoshimoto Namcoff was listening in and here he is with his

146
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:28,280
slant on what went on with the art for the program, where's my fucking latte? Is it fucking

147
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,800
without you? Well, I guess that's the question and no Adam. Keep your pants on because I'm not

148
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,160
talking about you personally. I'm talking about the letter you and how it applies to so-called

149
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:46,360
self-censorship and my show wears my fucking latte. Well, Robin from Inside Works mentioned yesterday

150
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,200
on daily source code that my show wears my fucking latte, which is a collection of Hollywood

151
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:59,640
assistant stories that I gathered here in town, had gone from where's my fucking latte to the

152
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:06,200
word fucking with an apostrophe where the you used to be. So it's fucking without you, which might

153
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,960
be appropriate for the internet. And the story, which is hardly worth telling once let alone twice,

154
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,600
is that Joe Carpenter called me up one day and he said, look, where's my fucking latte

155
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,720
tiles up on the front of the pod show site every now and then? And sometimes in the cosmic randomness

156
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:32,280
of the laws of random, it ends up right next to like bedtime stories for my kids. Now let me

157
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:38,440
make this clear. Joe did not tell me to change it. At no point did he say, you got to remove the word

158
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:45,160
fucking from the title because, you know, the word fucking next to bedtime stories is usually only

159
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,520
reserved for well pacific ghost hallway, which reminds me you got to come on the show and tell

160
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,480
that story about the time you passed out on out in John's yacht or even better the one with

161
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,640
Kurt Loder and the latex fist. But I digress. What it came down to is I understood Joe's concern

162
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:07,480
and he actually had a really good point. Is that the word fucking even with an asterisk in it?

163
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:15,000
Was just a salacious even more so? Some may even say titillating. I just like saying titillating.

164
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:21,800
Then the word fucking with the you in it because this way you can get away with just putting

165
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,600
fucking right out there without it really being fucking. And I thought, well that's pretty

166
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,440
fucking subversive and truth be told when the print version of where's my fucking latte comes out

167
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,240
with a whole bunch of other stories that weren't in the podcast. The plan had always been

168
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:43,640
to put the asterisk in in the word fucking anyway because I'd seen a bunch of covered designs

169
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:49,080
and the one that actually had the asterisk in it was to me a lot more eye catching

170
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,400
than the version that just had the word fucking on it and also we knew there would be a marketing

171
00:16:53,400 --> 00:17:00,360
problem with a version that just had the word fucking in it without the asterisk. So yes in the end

172
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,920
it was a business decision and not censorship that changed fucking from fucking to fucking with an asterisk.

173
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,800
And not only did I create this comment for you just so I could say the word fucking about

174
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:17,960
46 times on your show. Which I still fucking love I got to tell you I got to tell you man.

175
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:25,000
But also it gives me an excuse to tell you that in the latest chapter of where's my fucking latte

176
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,560
I dig into my own personal vault of stories and talk about how my upcoming podcast novel number

177
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,720
one with a bullet which started out life as a feature film script that I had optioned several times

178
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,320
all over this town and went through a lot of years of development hell. Before I realized

179
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:50,120
that screenplays are routinely taken away from their creators who are oftentimes left

180
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:56,040
with hardly credit on the final product and then how I was able to reclaim it and turn it into an

181
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:02,760
intellectual property. So Adam thanks for your time and in the end iTunes never allowed me to put

182
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:09,320
latte in their podcast directory. They're the ones that chose to censor it because of the title.

183
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,200
I have no idea what their fucking problem is.

184
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,800
Alright well that clears it up. Obviously the word latte is a problem mark. Can't you figure that out?

185
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:27,640
Look at my Google notebook. I really love this Google notebook. If you haven't seen it

186
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,520
where did you get it from? Google.com slash notebook and you can install it into any browser

187
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:37,720
and stores your notes on the server. These guys are so smart. It's kind of like an outline

188
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,440
because you can add subsections and so I'm looking at that now. A couple of things just

189
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:49,320
wanted to wing by you for a second. Good news looks like the clear channel breakup is starting.

190
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:56,040
We talked about this. The final phase in any company's existence or any industry's existence

191
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:05,720
actually is when the company starts to roll up and then it goes private and after that

192
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:11,320
after it has all the assets, a long-come guys like KKR. Let me see who's actually bidding for this.

193
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:24,280
Apollo Management, Carlisle, Sabirius Capital, Oak Hill partners. There's KKR. So essentially they're

194
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,680
going to break up this company and they're going to sell all the individual assets and that will be

195
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,880
the end of mainstream radio as we know it my friends because it'll just be bits and pieces and

196
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,640
not coordinated. No we're near the power that we have in podcasting. So that's a nice light note for

197
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:48,280
today. Great to link from Sinclair who sent me a link to openatc.com. If you're in

198
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:54,920
aviation, you got to check this out. You can download a KML file which is a Google Earth file

199
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:01,240
and it will show you with a five minute delay but it's exciting nonetheless. It will show you all

200
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,680
of the current IFR flight paths in any region around the globe and you can actually see the flight

201
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,720
numbers and see where the aircraft is. As of five minutes ago but still extremely cool in

202
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:18,120
it auto updates openatc.com. You definitely got to look at that. And then finally and this is a

203
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:25,240
little concerning. I've been getting a lot of people emailing me and a lot of pointers to this post

204
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:32,760
that Steve Gilmore put on his gesture lab which is gesturelab.com. And it's about the most

205
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,120
recent Gilmore gang. Now I want to say upfront that I feel the past weeks, maybe even the past

206
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:44,120
months of Gilmore gang have been really exemplary. The addition of Jason Calacanis has been fantastic

207
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,520
and I hear the same message basically. You know people listen to the show sometimes just because

208
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,240
they love to hate it so much which is great. Now that is the stuff that great shows are made of.

209
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:04,440
And Steve wrote this post, really emotional. The let it be gang is the title of it and he says

210
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:11,960
that he's really unhappy with the way he is on the show even though he knows the show is really

211
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,280
liked now. Maybe he doesn't want the show to be liked. I don't know maybe he's not trying to make

212
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,800
entertainment maybe he's trying to do something else but that's not clear from the post.

213
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,400
But apparently a lot of this came out during the most recent recording of the Gilmore gang,

214
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,440
the let it be gang. And so he only released three pieces. You know how he breaks up the show.

215
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,480
He only released three pieces and says he doesn't want to release the other piece of the show

216
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,040
because he hated the way he sounded on it and he felt that the whole show fell to shit. And obviously

217
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,240
I think that's a huge shame because I'd love to know what it's about. Interestingly enough,

218
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:54,920
Dan Farber, who was on the show, he has this he waxes very poetic about the only way that

219
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,080
audio and video and podcasting is going to work. He is a clairvoyant and quite a visionary.

220
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:08,120
And he says that independent is the way to go and this is the reason why Steve hates doing his

221
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,520
show on pod show. And he points to this page and I look at it and I don't see anything about that.

222
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:19,240
So maybe that was what was in the second half of the Gilmore gang that has not been aired. And I think

223
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,600
as an audience member, I think we deserve to know what's going on. I really think we deserve to hear about it.

224
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:31,480
So it's quite a shame. I really love to know more. And just if you read that post,

225
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,120
and of course I'll put a link in the show notes. It's emotional stuff. I'm like, wow, you know.

226
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,880
There's anything I can do to help. But I don't really know what the problem is because

227
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:48,200
everyone else seems to know, but I can't help. Otherwise, yeah, what I have done is

228
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,720
a company man and all I registered to Gilmorelessgang.com just in case.

229
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:14,680
Yeah. I just like to say what's the success. I think your screen phone to campaign is.

230
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:20,760
Every time I'm doing any activity involving tissues, I always think it's you with crying,

231
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:27,560
cleaning the staffing of fire. I always wish you a bad night's side. So maybe you should get

232
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:33,000
sponsored in this possible. It makes nice, soft toilet height for a mighty white mags.

233
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,120
If I can now. Roger. Roger. Roger. What a brilliant idea. I think that's fantastic. And

234
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:47,480
was it the wanker mags? Do you fold or scrunch after a, after a wank? Well, that's the next big question

235
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:54,040
on our minds. Roger and I've had some back and forth emails and private conversation. And I really

236
00:23:54,040 --> 00:24:00,760
don't think he's going to come to podcast con UK. Between you and I, I think that he feels that his

237
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:06,280
appearance, you know, people ridicule him or something like that. So I really want to build up his

238
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,600
confidence, but I don't think we're going to build it up before podcast con UK. But Roger, I just

239
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:18,360
do want you to know, even though you probably won't show up, you really are a pillar of podcasting

240
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:36,680
in the UK. And I just love you to death, man. Absolutely. Yeah, by the way, that domain name,

241
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:42,600
I registered Gilmore less gang.com. I used DS, the three checkout code got myself a great deal,

242
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:49,240
695, go daddy.com. All right, everybody on serious. I'll talk to you guys tomorrow. And for those of you

243
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,120
still here, let's listen to some more complaining. Hey, Adam, this is Steve Dinn from Halifax on the East

244
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,880
Coast of Canada. I was just listening to show 495 and I had a comment about what you said about the

245
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,840
Zoom. Now, I probably won't be getting a Zoom anytime soon, but that's beside the point.

246
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:11,000
My point is, who cares that the Zoom doesn't support podcasting? What does that even mean?

247
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,200
Why does a portable device need to support podcasting? Do iPod support podcasting? No, they actually

248
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:24,360
don't. iTunes supports podcasting. So you're going to accomplish the same thing with the combination

249
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:32,040
of any old podcast downloader like Juice and a fantastic feature of Windows Media Player that I

250
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:38,360
sorely wish was in iTunes. Media Player can scan a directory. So it monitors a directory on your

251
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:46,520
hard drive and can automatically add new files to your Media Player library. So I then used a dynamic

252
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:54,120
playlist to automatically sync un-listened to files from my Media Player library to my portable

253
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:00,200
player. And it's just goes to show the end-general. I think it's better to have multiple tools that do

254
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:08,440
one thing very well than to have a single behemoth that tries to do everything. That's the end of my

255
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:15,880
comment. So this is the start of my plug. SpineRadio.com. And folder. Yeah, folder. Okay.

256
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,000
I think well you make a good point. Although I don't look at these as devices. I look at them

257
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,960
as receivers. And I think that the general public looks at them as receivers. I spent an hour with

258
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:33,560
Christina yesterday. Here's what she wanted to do. She wanted to move all of her songs

259
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:41,320
from iTunes. She doesn't have an iPod. She lost it or broke it or whatever. Into her creative

260
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:49,080
Zen player. And what she was about to do, she was about to just delete everything. When she opened

261
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,920
up Windows Media Player, the software that controls the device. Because, you know, she doesn't know

262
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:00,200
any other way to do. It just doesn't know about, you know, about mounting it and opening it and

263
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,120
dragging stuff in directly. She just, you know, what popped open is Windows Media Player. That's the

264
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:09,880
way it's configured. And as she was about to just delete all of that, not knowing that it would

265
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,320
the same files because both iTunes and Windows Media Player scan your entire drive upon request.

266
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,880
Which, of course, everyone says yes. That's where, you know, I've seen people look at dialogue

267
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,520
boxes. Okay. Okay. Click. Okay. Click. Okay. Click. Okay. Then I don't even read anymore. So by default,

268
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:30,680
what happens? And it's just shitty software. You know, and all people who make software make shitty software.

269
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:39,640
The files were essentially the same because there were files that, you know, and all illegal

270
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,560
MP3s, I'm sure, as she had downloaded and put onto iTunes initially. And then Media Player had

271
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,720
scanned those same files. So she was about to delete a boot to delete everything, as you would say.

272
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,560
And so I was able to stop her, but it's really complicated. So I guess what we're all looking for

273
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:00,440
is a standard way, just so we can make it easy. It's what is what was attempted with the standard way to

274
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:07,240
subscribe, which is the RSS, why don't orange XML button? Well, that didn't work. And look at it now.

275
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,720
Now, you got like 20 fucking buttons to subscribe to stuff easily. That's not what you want. And would you

276
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,800
want a television or a radio that couldn't receive signals that you could receive on another

277
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,040
television or radio? I think that's the analog way that people still kind of look at these things.

278
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:30,120
Instead of podcasting support, perhaps I should say, couldn't we just have one comment? Maybe

279
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:36,360
just all players, when you plug them in, they just open up and then, you know, you can drag stuff

280
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,880
onto them. It wouldn't that be the easiest. It doesn't work that way with the iPod as example.

281
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:45,640
And the iPod has the market. But I think you know the point, just want to make it easier for

282
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,120
everybody. I know you know how to do this stuff. You know, you've been listening, you've been following

283
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:55,400
along. You had to learn. You didn't know from day one. It's much harder to learn when all the cool

284
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:02,200
people are doing it and no one's really sharing the information. It's just hard. Just trying to make it

285
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:08,200
easy. That's all. Well, I'm fat. And it just forces trying to hold my forces out. I want to get

286
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:16,440
serious yet. Because I sure wasn't looking. Man, I'm meant to. Ever since a day, we met.

287
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:23,480
Now I'm falling in deep prey. And for sleep, three hours a night ain't enough.

288
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:32,680
Yeah, just call their baby. Lord, help, baby. And just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

289
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,040
something tells me there's no such thing. A little bit of a little

290
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:49,000
and the next thing, you know, you're out behind the ring. And there's got to be strong and I'm trying to

291
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:58,760
hold on. But be in that tough thrill. But I'm all about her. One thing's for sure. I'm just a little

292
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:04,360
little bit of a little.

293
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:13,720
Ever since Rose, neighbors getting notes. She's been over three times this week.

294
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:21,000
The last little sweeten. Every time I see her, I'm thinking that I must be.

295
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:34,920
Something tells me there's no such thing. A little and the next thing, you know, you're out

296
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:41,720
behind the ring. A man's got to be strong and I'm trying to hold on. But be in that tough

297
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:49,000
thrill too. Because I'm all about her. One thing's for sure. I'm just a little

298
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:56,600
little. Well, I guess it sounds crazy. It's too late to save me. I know there I know, Rose.

299
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:05,160
So I must look funny. Down here on the one here, five just a little and a little

300
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:17,560
love. Something tells me there's no such thing. A little and the next thing, you know, you're

301
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:24,600
out behind the ring. A man's got to be strong and I'm trying to hold on. But be in that tough

302
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:31,800
thrill too. Because I'm all about her. One thing's for sure. I'm just a little

303
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:40,440
in love. I'm just a little in love. I'm just a little in love. I'm just a little in love.

304
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,800
Sean Patrick McGraw. The spot to save music never worth. I'm just a little in love.

305
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,040
Why ended up in Charlie for today? I'm happy now if you don't mind. All right, everybody.

306
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:57,080
I will be back here tomorrow. Take care of yourself. Bye bye.

307
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,680
