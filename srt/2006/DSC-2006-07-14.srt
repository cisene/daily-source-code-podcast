00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,280
Delta Sierra Charlie 421.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,280
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,280
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,280
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,280
Thank God it's...

9
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,280
There's a lot of entertainment grabber in the person.

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,280
Snap out of it.

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,280
What a hot odor.

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,280
Will it meet your filler cans?

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,280
Subcrime like a little girl.

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,280
It was a crime like a little girl.

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,280
Once you try to get jacked off under the table in front of the whole damn family.

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,280
And have some real problems.

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,280
Jack ass.

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,280
With how I wish you was wrong.

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,280
But try to get along.

20
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,280
Oh, yes he's right.

21
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,280
I should kiss him.

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,280
I just can't be beaten.

23
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Yes he's right.

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,280
How I wish you was wrong.

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,280
But try to get along.

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,280
Yes he's right.

27
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:25,280
I just can't be beaten.

28
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,280
Yes he's right.

29
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,280
But now I wish you was wrong.

30
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,280
Sunny combs and kitty cat rodeo.

31
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
Yes she's right.

32
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,280
And with a song like that, you know that she's here.

33
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,280
And she's right.

34
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
And she's right.

35
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,280
And she's right.

36
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,280
And she's right.

37
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
And she's right.

38
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
And she's right.

39
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
And she's right.

40
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
And she's right.

41
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,280
And she's right.

42
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,280
And she's right.

43
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
And she's right.

44
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
And she's right.

45
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
And she's right.

46
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,280
And she's right.

47
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,280
And she's right.

48
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,280
And she's right.

49
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,280
And she's right.

50
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
And she's right.

51
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
And she's right.

52
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
And she's right.

53
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
And she's right.

54
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
And she's right.

55
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
And she's right.

56
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
And she's right.

57
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
And she's right.

58
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
And she's right.

59
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
And she's right.

60
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
And she's right.

61
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
And she's right.

62
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,280
And she's right.

63
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,280
And she's right.

64
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
And she's right.

65
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,280
And she's right.

66
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,280
And she's right.

67
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,280
And she's right.

68
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:27,280
And she's right.

69
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,280
And she's right.

70
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,280
And she's right.

71
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,260
And it's right.

72
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,260
And they, yep, huh?

73
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,260
I've already started.

74
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,260
I've played a whole song already.

75
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,260
Yeah, that's where you said five minutes ago.

76
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,260
Sunny comes and kitty cat radio, of course.

77
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,260
So you can find that on the podcast and music network.

78
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,260
I'll just play a, I'll just do this thing before Patricia gets in here.

79
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,260
Okay, Adam, you totally called us out.

80
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,260
Yes, we were totally putting all this on.

81
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,260
The episode of Bone is already recorded.

82
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,260
And we already know the results, but we will never tell.

83
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,260
You'll have to listen for yourself.

84
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,260
I will tell you that it was the most fun I had in a long time.

85
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,260
I love C.C. and he loves me.

86
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,260
We were honored to be the first contestants on this show.

87
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,260
And personally, I can't wait for it to start playing.

88
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,260
It was so much fun.

89
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:35,260
And thank you, which you taught, Rutherford, for helping us out with this little promotion.

90
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,260
I believe it will premiere next week.

91
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,260
So go to bone.podshow.com and pre-registered.

92
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,260
So you don't miss it.

93
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:52,260
Actually, I participated in one of the very first pilot episodes, which never, of course, was posted.

94
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,260
But just to see how the game worked and how the questions were.

95
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,260
And I had a lot of fun too, I have to say.

96
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,260
Bone.podshow.com, the brand new game show from Podshow.

97
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,260
How do you only receive one thing?

98
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:10,260
Did you just not hear my wife said she would be right here?

99
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,260
Aaron Warm is posted on the webloggedcurry.com.

100
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,260
Adam, I don't exactly go for the you don't hear things I say.

101
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:23,260
This is referring to a conversation Patricia and I had where she said that just like Ron,

102
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,260
I don't hear a lot of things that my wife is telling me.

103
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,260
Aaron says, it's a catch 22 for poor men.

104
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,260
The proof that we don't hear stuff is that we didn't hear something.

105
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,260
How could we be sure that it was ever said if we didn't hear it?

106
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:43,260
Try turning the tables and trying to convince your wife that she didn't hear something that you said.

107
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,260
See if she goes forward or questions whether you've ever said it.

108
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,260
Hello, dear. How are you?

109
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,260
I was in a little bad.

110
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,260
I'm just feeling time until you get here.

111
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,260
I'm going to turn off the fan.

112
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,260
That's nice.

113
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,260
Well, it's loud.

114
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,260
Well, thank you for joining.

115
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,260
What were you doing?

116
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,260
You said you would be right there and then took another like 10 minutes.

117
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,260
I played songs. I played promos.

118
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:10,260
When no cleaner was here and then when he cleans the window and he's done,

119
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,260
he wants to check.

120
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,260
What the headphones on?

121
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,260
Wait with your story.

122
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,260
Yeah.

123
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,260
Have you taken glasses on?

124
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,260
You know, any of I want to sit here?

125
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,260
Yeah.

126
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,260
I'm disturbed.

127
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,260
You know, I have to take care of business first.

128
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,260
Yeah.

129
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,260
You know.

130
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,260
Okay. Well, why didn't you say, yeah.

131
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,260
I'm going to take care of business first.

132
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,260
I said that.

133
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,260
But I said I was starting the show.

134
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,260
Yeah, now.

135
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,260
So.

136
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,260
Your show.

137
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,260
Oh, now it's my show.

138
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,260
And your phone.

139
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,260
Oh, okay.

140
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,260
Oh, okay.

141
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,260
Oh, just wanted to make sure.

142
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,260
Did you hear that?

143
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,260
It is still my show.

144
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,260
Of course.

145
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,260
Yeah.

146
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,260
Would you please stop moving the microphone up?

147
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,260
I just moved it down.

148
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,260
Oh.

149
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,260
Yeah.

150
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,260
Because otherwise, you're talking on.

151
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,260
But I'm taller than you think.

152
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,260
No, you're not.

153
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,260
That's the more.

154
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,260
Why?

155
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,260
Because then you're projecting into the microphones, which better.

156
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,260
Okay.

157
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,260
Do you want me to, can I help you with something?

158
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,260
You seem to be swiveling an out of control on the bar stool.

159
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,260
Oh, I'm fine.

160
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,260
Don't worry.

161
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,260
Hey, baby.

162
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,260
How you doing?

163
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,260
It's Friday.

164
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,260
Yeah.

165
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,260
It's Friday.

166
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,260
It is.

167
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,260
Yeah.

168
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,260
I was so tired.

169
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,260
The whole week.

170
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,260
Yeah.

171
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,260
Well, we went to bed every night at one thirty.

172
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,260
What's the matter with your curse?

173
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,260
You don't want to go to bed.

174
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,260
You don't seem to understand.

175
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,260
You never hear me complain about being tired.

176
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,260
Even though I'm tired.

177
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,260
You're young.

178
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,260
You're still young.

179
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,260
Well, thank you.

180
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,260
When I was your age, I wasn't tired.

181
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,260
I know.

182
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,260
But why don't you just go to bed?

183
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,260
You don't have to wait up.

184
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,260
Just go to bed over.

185
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,260
No, I have to.

186
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,260
Because I'm afraid that you guys leave the candles burning.

187
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,260
No, honey.

188
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:41,260
I have an entire condo in San Francisco, which is still as far as I know.

189
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,260
I was not burned down yet.

190
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,260
Yeah.

191
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,260
And I've got candles.

192
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,260
Yeah.

193
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,260
I do lock the doors.

194
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,260
Excuse me.

195
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,260
This is.

196
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,260
It's that the reason why you stay up because you're afraid that we're going to leave the candles.

197
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,260
I leave the candles burning.

198
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,260
Leave the doors.

199
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,260
I do not.

200
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,260
I do not leave the door.

201
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,260
The refrigerator open.

202
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,260
I don't.

203
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,260
That's your daughter.

204
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,260
Stop it.

205
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,260
Oh, you really get me riled up when you do this shit.

206
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,260
Don't.

207
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,260
Don't be blaming me for like the fridge door of that crappy ass.

208
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,260
How can you even call it a fridge?

209
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,260
That's true.

210
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,260
Yeah.

211
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,260
It's not even a fridge.

212
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,260
It's like a cupboard.

213
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,260
But.

214
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,260
Okay.

215
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,260
So, did you hear me laugh?

216
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,260
Start laughing when you get angry.

217
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,260
I'm sorry.

218
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,260
I'm sorry.

219
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,260
You know.

220
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,260
Honey.

221
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,260
Girlfriend.

222
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,260
You have not seen me angry.

223
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,260
You have not seen the devil come out of me because the devil in me is wearing

224
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,260
Prada.

225
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,260
Okay.

226
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,260
So, I've already established.

227
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,260
I don't leave the refrigerator door open.

228
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,260
Okay.

229
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,260
So, I leave the.

230
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,260
So, the refrigerator door.

231
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,260
I'm not really open.

232
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,260
But you have to close.

233
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,260
Close it.

234
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,260
Okay.

235
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,260
Look, give me a checklist.

236
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,260
I'm good at checklist.

237
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,260
I have to do this before I go flying.

238
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,260
Give me a checklist.

239
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,260
And then then you'll know.

240
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,260
And then I'll even check it off on the piece of paper.

241
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,260
So, and in the morning you can get up and you can see that I did the checklist.

242
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,260
Okay.

243
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,260
So, it's the refrigerator door.

244
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,260
No candles.

245
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,260
Lock all doors.

246
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,260
That's the garden door.

247
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,260
Three things.

248
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,260
Three.

249
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,260
I want you to have the rest you need as an older woman.

250
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,260
So, okay.

251
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,260
What else?

252
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,260
Now you know.

253
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,260
That's it.

254
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,260
Exactly.

255
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,260
And just to know that you guys are still walking around through the house.

256
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,260
And, you know, you need somebody to just say, okay, guys.

257
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,260
Okay.

258
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,260
All right.

259
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,260
So, it is something totally different.

260
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,260
Yeah.

261
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,260
And I can't sleep when I know other people are still awake.

262
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,260
But the other people are your husband and daughter.

263
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,260
You know, we're fine.

264
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,260
The other people's in that we're fine.

265
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:40,260
It's so unfair for you to blame us that you are tired.

266
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,260
You can go to bed whenever you want.

267
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,260
I don't think it's that it's just getting up.

268
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,260
Did you bring your tea?

269
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,260
No.

270
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,260
Where's my tea?

271
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,260
I've made it for you downstairs.

272
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,260
Put it on the counter.

273
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,260
No, we're safe today.

274
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,260
What's the matter with you?

275
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,260
Because you were late.

276
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,260
And you're pretending like, oh, whatever, do you show?

277
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,260
Because you were late.

278
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,260
And I made tea for you.

279
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,260
Okay.

280
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,260
Of all the things we discussed Wednesday on the show, I already told you this.

281
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:10,260
What was the number one thing everyone caught onto and called in about?

282
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,260
Oh, the folder in there.

283
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,260
Folder or scruncher.

284
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,260
Sure.

285
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,260
You will not believe the things people are interested in.

286
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,260
Yeah.

287
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,260
And think it's important.

288
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,260
Check it out.

289
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,260
Hi Adam.

290
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,260
This is Jan from bucket at bucketpodcast.com.

291
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,260
I was just listening to Charlie and listening to your conversation about punching

292
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,260
versus folding.

293
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,260
And I have to say, I always thought the burning question about toilet paper was whether you put

294
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,260
the roll on so that it feeds from over or from under.

295
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,260
There's an argument in my house at least.

296
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,260
I don't know which is a different between men and women over and under.

297
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,260
Or maybe a fat regional whatever.

298
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,260
I'm totally over by the way.

299
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,260
And I'm a scruncher.

300
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,260
Hi.

301
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,260
Yeah, I'd need to see.

302
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,260
I'm a scruncher.

303
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,260
Yeah.

304
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,260
I need to be over.

305
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,260
You know.

306
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,260
I totally agree.

307
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,260
It has to be over the roll on the under.

308
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,260
Yeah.

309
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,260
And otherwise it could.

310
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,260
It's own.

311
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,260
It's own.

312
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,260
Through gravity.

313
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,260
It's own weight could unroll the entire roll.

314
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,260
Yeah.

315
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,260
Yeah.

316
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,260
Yeah.

317
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,260
I agree.

318
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,260
And hotels always do it like that.

319
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,260
So there must be a rule for it.

320
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,260
I like it over with little point in it.

321
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,260
And I think that ladies are more folders because of the scruncher.

322
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,260
Yes.

323
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:27,260
But most of them are, I think, folders because we're more sensitive there.

324
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,260
Dude.

325
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,260
I'm a folder.

326
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,260
But you're sensitive.

327
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,260
Oh, yeah.

328
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,260
Oh, you know.

329
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,260
You're so sensitive.

330
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,260
Yeah.

331
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,260
You know, there's something else that, you know, that always seems to be a point of discussion

332
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,260
is men don't put the toilet seat down.

333
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,260
Yeah.

334
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:48,260
And I think I'm a very simple solution to this controversy.

335
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,260
Why don't, why doesn't everybody agree that when you're done with the toilet, you put

336
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,260
the lid down.

337
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,260
Yeah.

338
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,260
I think women should also put the lid down.

339
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,260
I think there's nothing more to do.

340
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,260
I always do.

341
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,260
And the, and the real.

342
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,260
The lid.

343
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,260
That's what I mean.

344
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,260
So that way everybody does some work.

345
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,260
So it's not like women don't have to do anything.

346
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,260
But I see lots of women who complain about not men not putting the seat back down.

347
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,260
I hate that gaping.

348
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,260
I hate it too.

349
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,260
It's just like a big look.

350
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,260
Like, you're here.

351
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,260
Did you hear that?

352
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,260
Ready for you.

353
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:22,260
Did you read about, there's a McDonald's that opened up in Holland.

354
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:27,260
And of course, McDonald's is a franchise with the American company comes and checks it out.

355
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,260
And he had two of those urinals, the ones that,

356
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,260
the modern art urinals that looked like a big, big mouth with big red lips.

357
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

358
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,260
And the Americans said, you can't have that.

359
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,260
You have to take it out.

360
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,260
Well, I mean, it is kind of like putting your dick in a mouth.

361
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,260
I mean, let's be careful.

362
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,260
Even that.

363
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,260
That's the joke.

364
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,260
Uh-huh.

365
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,260
Yeah, but that's no human.

366
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,260
No, there's no humor in the McDonald's corporation when it comes to that.

367
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,260
But does the only thing they have on their mind in America?

368
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,260
Correct.

369
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,260
How come they didn't like it?

370
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,260
Maybe.

371
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,260
See?

372
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,260
See?

373
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,260
So we have scrunchers and we have folders.

374
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,260
And we have another category.

375
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,260
Oh, yes.

376
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,260
Oh.

377
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,260
Hey, Adam.

378
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,260
This is something that starts all the podcast.

379
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,260
And I, uh, we're just going to like to weigh in on the scrunching versus folding.

380
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,260
And I'm a roller.

381
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,260
Uh, try to figure that one out.

382
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,260
A roller?

383
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,260
But they have?

384
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,260
I think.

385
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,260
Well, listen to this next one.

386
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,260
Um, this is a roller.

387
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,260
A roller.

388
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,260
This next person, Dr. Oh, we know.

389
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,260
Friend of the show.

390
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,260
Oh, you've rolled it up.

391
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,260
No, no, no, no, no.

392
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,260
I think it's, it's roll around your finger.

393
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,260
Listen to this side.

394
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,260
Hello, Adam.

395
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,260
It's, uh, Dr. Oh, here.

396
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,260
You see, uh, noisy traffic sounds.

397
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,260
Oh, I'm over.

398
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,260
Pretty good.

399
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,260
I run out as well before.

400
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,260
And it just message.

401
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,260
I just want to say yeah, along with everyone else.

402
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,260
Um, condolences about your mum.

403
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,260
Um, I want to, to send a message before today.

404
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,260
How much are you talking about your mum?

405
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,260
Um, made me go up and see mine.

406
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,260
Uh-huh.

407
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,260
Uh-huh.

408
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,260
Because I thought.

409
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,260
I've been thinking about what you've been saying about mum's.

410
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,260
And unfortunately, I don't know everything else.

411
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,260
You know, then you realise that I should make more of an effort to get on a train

412
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,260
and travel three hours to see her.

413
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,260
Uh-huh.

414
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,260
Ah.

415
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,260
Ah.

416
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,260
I think people go visit their mum.

417
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,260
Yeah, you should.

418
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,260
Yeah.

419
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,260
Three hours by train.

420
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,260
That what a pain in the house, that is.

421
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,260
That is, yeah.

422
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,260
Um.

423
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,260
Um.

424
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,260
Break it through my mum.

425
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,260
And the, uh, folding or punching, uh, debate.

426
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:32,260
My mum used to tell me, and me to use two sheets of toilet paper.

427
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,260
See, it's got this.

428
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:42,260
Um, and I used to really get annoyed when toilet paper was not folded until I became angry.

429
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,260
Uh, and then sometimes I would just punch up just because.

430
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,260
But I also do the, um, to wrapping down the two fingers thing.

431
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:54,260
So, you know, and you're quite cool.

432
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,260
And it's quite cool.

433
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,260
And it's pretty cool.

434
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,260
It's hard.

435
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,260
It's hard.

436
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,260
I'm going to put it on.

437
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,260
Uh, so I shall leave it there.

438
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,260
Um, and the Elena?

439
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,260
Yeah.

440
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,260
Okay.

441
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,260
Thank you.

442
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,260
Dr.

443
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,260
She talks like she has still a piece of paper in there.

444
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,260
I know her.

445
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,260
I don't say that.

446
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,260
She's front of the show.

447
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,260
Uh, she's walking.

448
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,260
Yeah, I know.

449
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,260
But what is that rapid around your finger thing that's kind of, I don't like that at all.

450
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,260
That sounds like it.

451
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,260
Because you could rip right through and then, you know, then, of course.

452
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,260
You get the drink.

453
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,260
No.

454
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,260
Neal touch.

455
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,260
Oh yeah, that's not good.

456
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,260
And what if you nail by it?

457
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,260
Oh.

458
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,260
Which, of course.

459
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,260
Do you notice when you look at Big Brother, you know?

460
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,260
Big Brother is on how many people buy nails?

461
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,260
Well, that one girl is us.

462
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,260
Yeah, it's outrageous.

463
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,260
What's her name?

464
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,260
Many people.

465
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,260
Well, I haven't seen many in Big Brother.

466
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,260
Really, they all buy their nails.

467
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,260
Oh, everybody is doing it once.

468
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,260
It's just, I've never, ever, ever did it in my life.

469
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,260
But then again, my nails are really hard to do.

470
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,260
Yes, right.

471
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,260
The Korean ladies make them into rock.

472
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,260
No, but it's just disgusting.

473
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,260
There's so much dirt underneath your nails.

474
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,260
Don't stick it in your mouth.

475
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,260
Don't do that.

476
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,260
And you, and you know, and the look of, you know, those nails are just so.

477
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,260
They look so nervous those hands.

478
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,260
Yeah.

479
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,260
Very nervous people.

480
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,260
Chew it off.

481
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,260
Yeah.

482
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:27,260
Well, anyway, so Patricia and I really have one official Charlie mission for you.

483
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,260
Doesn't matter whether you fold or scrunch.

484
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,260
Yeah.

485
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,260
You need to use, excuse me, Sensei.

486
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,260
Oh, this Sensei moment.

487
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,260
Hold on, I had to email about that.

488
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,260
Brought to you by podshowradio.com.

489
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,260
Sorry.

490
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,260
How long can we just go on about the toilet paper?

491
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,260
Oh, forever.

492
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,260
Oh, man.

493
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,260
I could talk about pooping forever.

494
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,260
Fantastic.

495
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,260
That's a man thing.

496
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,260
It is totally a man thing.

497
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,260
Yeah, we women don't.

498
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,260
Anyway, you need to use wipes.

499
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,260
Okay, baby wipes or whatever the hell you call it.

500
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,260
Now, very talking about, you know, very, very important.

501
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,260
Everybody, that is the thing.

502
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,260
Just buy those baby things.

503
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,260
Don't flush them.

504
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,260
Always look at the package.

505
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,260
And you can read if it's flushable.

506
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,260
Why the flushables don't get the non flushable.

507
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,260
No, no.

508
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,260
It would be very careful.

509
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,260
You know, but these are also toddlers and baby things.

510
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,260
It says flushable.

511
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,260
I know they're Patricia hygiene moments.

512
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,260
Yes.

513
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,260
It is so lost.

514
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,260
I must say you're so, always in all sorts.

515
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,260
Everybody will have a very clean, beautiful, but non-sour.

516
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,260
No.

517
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,260
Non-sour.

518
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,260
Except after.

519
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,260
I was always so disgusted because when I was young,

520
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,260
I used to trim.

521
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,260
You know, we have the trims just like in San Francisco.

522
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,260
Like the lady in the trim.

523
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,260
In Rotterdam.

524
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:46,260
And I had to take the trim to go to gym or to go to ballet classes.

525
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,260
You know.

526
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,260
And when the trim was full and you already set down,

527
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,260
you were lucky to sit down.

528
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,260
People would come and shove their asses.

529
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,260
And, you know, got because it was very crowded with everything.

530
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,260
And the butts will just, you know.

531
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,260
Just kind of waft weight.

532
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,260
Waft? Yeah.

533
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,260
Past your nose.

534
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,260
Your nose.

535
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,260
And I always thought, what is the matter with these people?

536
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,260
Why do they smell?

537
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,260
Wow.

538
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,260
And I think that the solution is.

539
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,260
Proper hygiene is wipes.

540
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,260
We know there's, we've had all that wonderful product that we got.

541
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,260
I even wiped the dogs in it, but you know.

542
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,260
Okay.

543
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,260
You think that's a joke.

544
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,260
It's absolutely true.

545
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,260
And they have doggy wipes.

546
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,260
Yeah.

547
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,260
Yeah, but the doggy wipes.

548
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,260
The dog uses the, the people wipes.

549
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,260
No, no, no, doggy wipes.

550
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,260
You don't use doggy wipes.

551
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,260
Yes, I do.

552
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,260
I have it in the basket downstairs.

553
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,260
Really?

554
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,260
Yeah.

555
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,260
Those are doggy wipes.

556
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,260
Doggy wipes.

557
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,260
Oh, can I?

558
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,260
Are they substitutable in case the human wipes are?

559
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,260
I don't know.

560
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,260
Just a, just a two dogs.

561
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,260
Yes, that I, we'll get to your thing in the second.

562
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,260
Yes.

563
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:56,260
I talked about this movie, The Little Man, which is The Wayne Brothers.

564
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,260
And they want me to talk about it on the show.

565
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,260
And I said send me a copy of the movie because it opens today, actually, in America.

566
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,260
Send me a copy of the movie so I can take a look at it.

567
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:13,260
And I can tell people, it's one of these typical summer blockbuster really idiotic kind of kind of movies.

568
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,260
It really is American movie.

569
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,260
Yeah, you know the Wayne's Brothers.

570
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,260
The Wayne's Brothers.

571
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,260
From an living color.

572
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,260
Oh, those Wayne's brothers.

573
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

574
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,260
It's sure.

575
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,260
It's kind of like, remember the movie white chicks where they were.

576
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,260
Oh, okay.

577
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,260
So it's that, in fact.

578
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,260
Incredible.

579
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,260
Exactly.

580
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,260
But it's going to be a big blockbuster.

581
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,260
You know it is.

582
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,260
Because I'm always funny.

583
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:39,260
You know, seeing on the couch and, you know, it's nice, but not going to a theatre.

584
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,260
So they said, sorry.

585
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,260
We can't ship the movie to Adam.

586
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:48,260
This is coming from the guy over at, was at the media planner, Universal McCann.

587
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,260
Oh, yeah.

588
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,260
That was the name Bill.

589
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,260
No Robert.

590
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,260
Not Robert.

591
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:58,260
The biggest reason is that they've shipped DVDs of past movie pre-releases.

592
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:04,260
And they've been burned by employees forwarding the movie and then putting them online.

593
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,260
Oh.

594
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:09,260
So they don't want to send them out of any works that are afraid that I would rip the movie and put it online.

595
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,260
Yeah.

596
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,260
Yeah.

597
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,260
I wouldn't do that.

598
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,260
No.

599
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,260
So there are a couple things I can mention.

600
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:19,260
Because that's this podcast about the movie Little Men podcast.com.

601
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,260
With interviews from the Red Carpet Premier with Sean and Marlon Wayne.

602
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,260
Very, very funny.

603
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,260
Those guys are funny.

604
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,260
Great actors.

605
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,260
The plot is silly.

606
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,260
It's silly.

607
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,260
It's like quite chicks.

608
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,260
Okay.

609
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,260
Here's the synopsis.

610
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,260
They're little.

611
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,260
Check it out.

612
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:44,260
In the hilarious comedy Little Men, Sean Wains plays a man so anxious to become a father.

613
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:49,260
That he mistakes a short stature baby faced criminal on the run.

614
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,260
Played by Marlon Wayne's for his newly adopted son.

615
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,260
Oh, no.

616
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,260
Uh-huh.

617
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,260
Exactly.

618
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,260
Oh.

619
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,260
Oh.

620
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,260
Our daughter played hokey to go see the movies.

621
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,260
We found out.

622
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,260
Yeah.

623
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,260
Boy.

624
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,260
That was disappointing.

625
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,260
Yeah.

626
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,260
Horrible.

627
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,260
And she's no good at hiding that shit because she actually left the rest of the movie.

628
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,260
No, she looked me in the eyes and I said, you're lying.

629
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,260
You're lying.

630
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,260
Because I found the receipt for that.

631
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,260
Yeah.

632
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,260
I found the cinema.

633
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,260
It said Monday 11 a.m.

634
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,260
And I'm looking at the killing.

635
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,260
That's a school day.

636
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,260
Uh-huh.

637
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,260
And you know what?

638
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,260
She's so stupid.

639
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,260
She leaves it in her bag.

640
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:33,260
You know, while I always clean it out, get the stuff, you know, from lunch out of her bag.

641
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,260
So.

642
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,260
I don't think she'll be doing that again, though.

643
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,260
I think so.

644
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,260
No.

645
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,260
Because she saw that I was very disappointed.

646
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,260
Because I say.

647
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,260
I see.

648
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,260
Intelligent people don't do that.

649
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,260
Yeah.

650
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,260
No.

651
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,260
Don't do that.

652
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,260
So she's coming home with Dan today.

653
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,260
Dan, who, of course, was a accomplice in this.

654
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,260
You're going to give them shit.

655
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,260
Yeah.

656
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,260
You don't have to tell anything to him.

657
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,260
It's, I'm, I'm, you know, as my response to me.

658
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,260
No, I think you should give Dan some, a little bit of shit.

659
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,260
Just a little bit of shit.

660
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,260
Just a little bit of shit.

661
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,260
Shied.

662
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,260
Come on.

663
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,260
Get some shit.

664
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,260
Just a little bit of shit.

665
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,260
Stupid little brat.

666
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,260
Beat his beard to a pulp of food.

667
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,260
Really?

668
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,260
Why did she do my job today?

669
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,260
I don't know.

670
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,260
Is your ass out of balance?

671
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,260
Cheers.

672
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,260
Oh, hon, oh, hon, hon.

673
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,260
I paid her.

674
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,260
I'd have to present her with me.

675
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,260
Once to know if you're scrunch or a folder.

676
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,260
It's Patricia.

677
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,260
Patricia Pive from the daily source code featuring Adam Curry.

678
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,260
Oh, you know, Patricia.

679
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,260
Radiant smile like a baby with wind.

680
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,260
Really big, full-bodied hair.

681
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,260
Yeah.

682
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,260
Little big, you know.

683
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,260
Put a makeup on with a spade.

684
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,260
Femesing of the nose of the herd off.

685
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,260
Very short.

686
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,260
It's a bottom on the curb when she crosses the road.

687
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,260
That's right.

688
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,260
Miss Piggy.

689
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,260
Okay.

690
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,260
I'll tell her.

691
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,260
Pid ups head he uses a scrunched go for lovely to see Patricia.

692
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,260
Closer door on the way out.

693
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,260
It's time to play the music.

694
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,260
It's time to light the lights.

695
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,260
It's time to meet Patricia on the map.

696
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,260
But show tonight.

697
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,260
The talking about short.

698
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,260
Well, before we get to that, just, okay, go ahead.

699
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,260
Talking about short.

700
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,260
You know what I'm writing a paper?

701
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,260
What's that?

702
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,260
A new study by the

703
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,260
Medics at Bristol University.

704
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,260
Yeah.

705
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:26,260
Show that people with short legs have better sex lives.

706
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,260
No.

707
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,260
They have heart problems.

708
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,260
Really?

709
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,260
More heart problems than people with long legs.

710
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,260
You can't even know that.

711
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,260
You can't even.

712
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,260
It's got to do with the sort of a vein that goes through your body.

713
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,260
So.

714
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,260
It's.

715
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,260
It's the.

716
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,260
What does it said?

717
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:50,260
It means there's less chance of a clot halting blood flow and causing a heart attack when

718
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,260
You have long.

719
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,260
Longer legs.

720
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,260
Sounds like it sounds like they need to fill some of that page to me.

721
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,260
The arts.

722
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,260
Watch your weight and have regular.

723
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,260
No, you know what?

724
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,260
Like sure the man, especially sure the man.

725
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,260
Yeah.

726
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,260
You know.

727
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,260
They have more heart problems.

728
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,260
Isn't it stupid?

729
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,260
Well, who did this?

730
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,260
I have actually I don't have very long legs.

731
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,260
No, on your legs are beautiful.

732
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,260
They're nice and lengthy.

733
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,260
Well, they belong to my body.

734
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,260
Thank God.

735
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,260
He imagined them on me.

736
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,260
That would look pretty weird.

737
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,260
They look good with my body with my legs.

738
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,260
But.

739
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,260
Isn't that strange?

740
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,260
No.

741
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,260
It makes sense, I guess.

742
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,260
And you know that.

743
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,260
People with big heads.

744
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,260
Our often on American television.

745
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,260
Hold on one second, hun.

746
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,260
If you're listening to us and stars one or two on the serious

747
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:39,260
satellites, you can download the rest of the show at daily source code.com

748
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:44,260
and then we'll be back Monday with a full four hour block of the pod show on stars one

749
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,260
or two.

750
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:52,260
The bigger your head, the less chance you have of getting dementia in old age.

751
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,260
Really?

752
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,260
I'm lucky.

753
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,260
You're not.

754
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,260
I have a small head.

755
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,260
Of course, it's easy.

756
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,260
I need the small head to stick it up my ass once in a while.

757
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,260
It's very important.

758
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,260
Oh, God.

759
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,260
You know what's nice?

760
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,260
You know, well, go ahead.

761
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,260
I was going to say something else.

762
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,260
Kylie is back.

763
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,260
Hold on a second about Kylie.

764
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,260
No, just that.

765
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:21,260
I want to stay on the blood clot stuff.

766
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,260
We got an offer.

767
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,260
Oh.

768
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,260
Yeah, this morning on email from a Dutch company that makes a certain type of,

769
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,260
I'm not going to say the name of a certain type of healthy,

770
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,260
the margin like products.

771
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,260
Yeah.

772
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:38,260
And so the agency, it's gray advertising because the relationship,

773
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:44,260
send me an email and said, would we be interested in appearing in a commercial

774
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,260
for this?

775
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,260
Yeah.

776
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,260
However, we would both have to have high cholesterol.

777
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:56,260
And I said, well, they did that with Lulu here.

778
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,260
Well, I replied and I said, well, you know,

779
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,260
they pay well.

780
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,260
Well, I says it will have high cholesterol.

781
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,260
If you have high budget.

782
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:08,260
If you have high budget, we can have whatever cholesterol you want.

783
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,260
We adjust.

784
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,260
Oh, gosh.

785
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,260
I need some margin.

786
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,260
Now, it's probably a approach.

787
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,260
I think other people too.

788
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,260
Maybe.

789
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,260
No, it's not.

790
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,260
It's seen pretty individualistic because we fit into the age group.

791
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,260
Fuck.

792
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,260
What are you talking about?

793
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,260
I'm an old man, baby.

794
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,260
I'm going to be 42.

795
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,260
I remember when my dad was 40.

796
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:34,260
I was like, God, guys old 40 is old 42.

797
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:40,260
Well, the 40 is you have to, you know, have the regular checkups too.

798
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:46,260
For those of you who missed yesterday or Wednesday when we talked about the new drama series,

799
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,260
scripted drama, which means well written, well acted, well produced,

800
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,260
fucking brilliant shadow falls.

801
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,260
And you can pre-register.

802
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,260
It's going to happen this month.

803
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,260
Only a couple more weeks.

804
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,260
Shadowfalls.podshow.com.

805
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,260
Here's a clip from the first episode.

806
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,260
Here and gotten her car.

807
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,260
Hoping to find her friend from the college newspaper at home.

808
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,260
Hey, Ramsey, you in there?

809
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,260
I don't believe he is scared of it.

810
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,260
Jesus, you frightened me.

811
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,260
I'm sorry about that, darling.

812
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,260
Oh, I know that voice.

813
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,260
Who you know?

814
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,260
My name's Brian.

815
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,260
Brian Gend.

816
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,260
Say,

817
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,260
you look just like your father.

818
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,260
He, he, you know, my dad didn't you sort of.

819
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,260
I'm the one that killed him.

820
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,260
That's not good.

821
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,260
Yeah, that sounds good.

822
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,260
It's going to be great.

823
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,260
This is going to be perfect for all those trips I make.

824
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,260
Lovely.

825
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,260
On, uh, between here and San Francisco.

826
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,260
Yeah.

827
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,260
I love listening to drawn radio dramas.

828
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,260
An audio books and all kinds of stuff.

829
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,260
Yeah.

830
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,260
I love it.

831
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,260
I can really get into that.

832
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,260
It's a crazy reader.

833
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,260
So it would be very nice for me too.

834
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,260
I like to listen.

835
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,260
You devour the sun in the mirror every day.

836
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,260
I fall asleep.

837
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,260
I don't know what it is.

838
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,260
Really?

839
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,260
Yeah.

840
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,260
Now have for you.

841
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,260
Oh, my eye.

842
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,260
You even fall asleep when I read.

843
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,260
No, but I love to listen when I was young.

844
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:09,260
My mom always read all sorts of books for us.

845
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,260
Mm-hmm.

846
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,260
It's a lost art.

847
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,260
This is the telling stories and audio.

848
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,260
We have a couple of podcasts that I do it very well.

849
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,260
We love it.

850
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:20,260
But really, when it comes down to a whole piece of fiction, there's brand new.

851
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,260
I think it's fantastic.

852
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,260
I love it.

853
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,260
Sensei.

854
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,260
Excuse me.

855
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,260
God.

856
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,260
Kylie's back.

857
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,260
Is that what you wanted to say?

858
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,260
Well, no.

859
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,260
There was a big picture in the paper this morning.

860
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,260
I thought, oh, you know, I'm happy.

861
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,260
I'm happy for her.

862
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,260
Man, she went through it.

863
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,260
I think she went through it.

864
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,260
Yeah.

865
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,260
She's going to tell us now.

866
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,260
So there's a couple of interviews.

867
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,260
She's going to be on the TV.

868
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,260
She's going to be on the TV.

869
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,260
She's going to be on the TV.

870
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,260
She's going to be on the TV.

871
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,260
She did already.

872
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,260
She's got to do.

873
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,260
Letterman, Leno, and Parkie.

874
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,260
Yeah.

875
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,260
That's what she has to do.

876
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,260
I think so.

877
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,260
And she's going to tell us how she felt.

878
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,260
And, you know.

879
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,260
Don't have to tell me, man.

880
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,260
She thought, like, shit.

881
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,260
Well, she was very scared.

882
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,260
No kidding.

883
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,260
Yeah.

884
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,260
And the thing is, you know, when you're famous, you have to hide.

885
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,260
What do you mean you have to hide?

886
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,260
Well, you know, you have to hide inside because they're always,

887
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,260
paparazzi.

888
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,260
Paparazzi, looking for you.

889
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,260
See how bad you look.

890
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,260
Oh, man.

891
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,260
Did you see about those pictures in the Italian magazine of Lady Dye?

892
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,260
No.

893
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,260
No.

894
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,260
I didn't see the pictures.

895
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,260
No.

896
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,260
Well, they didn't publish them.

897
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,260
No.

898
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,260
But in Italian.

899
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,260
Yeah.

900
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,260
I had a publish it.

901
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,260
I would be to that.

902
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,260
Well, there's only one reason, of course.

903
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,260
To sell them.

904
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,260
To sell magazines, of course.

905
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,260
That is just without any reason.

906
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,260
That's true.

907
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,260
That's yeah.

908
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,260
That's without respect.

909
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,260
That's not necessary.

910
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,260
Horrible.

911
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,260
I've got a message from Callie.

912
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,260
Hey, Adam.

913
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,260
It's Callie from Geek.

914
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,260
Brief TV.

915
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,260
It's been way too long.

916
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,260
Hasn't it?

917
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,260
Here I go today.

918
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,260
I heard my very first daily source code.

919
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,260
It was the second podcast I listened to.

920
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,260
The first one was Dawn and Drew just a few days earlier.

921
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,260
Within six months, you convinced us to buy our first Mac.

922
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,260
And then we bought another one.

923
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,260
And another one.

924
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,260
And another one.

925
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,260
When Dawn and Drew quit their day job, we started an audio podcast.

926
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,260
Then Apple released the iPod with video.

927
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,260
We saw Tiki Bar and had the idea for Geek Brief.

928
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,260
It's a year later.

929
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,260
We have a worldwide audience.

930
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,260
And now, Pod Show Plus is making it easy for anyone to do the same thing.

931
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,260
It's amazing.

932
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,260
I just wanted to say thanks.

933
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:15,260
I also want to tell you about a new artist in the Pod Save Music network.

934
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,260
His name is Doc Bates.

935
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:21,260
And when we told him about the PMN, he loved it so much that he uploaded several of his songs

936
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,260
and moved his fan site to Pod Show Plus.

937
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,260
My favorite is my old pickup truck never lets me down.

938
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,260
Would you play it for me?

939
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,260
How can you refuse?

940
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,260
You're just this piece and make it really fast?

941
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,260
No, that's just the way Callie talks.

942
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,260
Really?

943
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,260
Yeah, that's what you're talking about.

944
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,260
You know, from a Geek Brief TV.

945
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,260
Yeah, yeah.

946
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,260
Maybe she just gets excited when she's talking about it.

947
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,260
Thanks, sir.

948
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,260
I bought some country, baby.

949
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,260
Don't you like the country?

950
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,260
Have the black top looking for a gravel road.

951
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:18,260
Yeah, my old pickup truck never lets me down.

952
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:24,260
She's got a mowing drive all the walls there.

953
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:30,260
Yes, she got a CVN, a CDN, a no-late track.

954
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,260
She's my old pickup truck.

955
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:37,260
And a lack of old pickup truck never lets me down.

956
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:43,260
Yeah, my old pickup truck never lets me down.

957
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:57,260
Oh my god.

958
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:10,260
Well, she takes me hunting in a fishy anywhere that I want to do.

959
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:16,260
We ain't never been stuck in a footnut street or snow.

960
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:20,260
He's got a tiger ball tower to keep a soul track.

961
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,260
Got a cooler in the run and a bed in the back.

962
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:28,260
Got my hunky turkey rope rocking over you.

963
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,260
Yeah, my own pick-up truck.

964
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,260
Never let's be down.

965
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:40,260
She's got a four-wheel drive, a one-to-one stereo sound.

966
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:45,260
Yeah, she got a TV and a CD and an old eight track.

967
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:50,260
She's my own pick-up truck.

968
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,260
Never let's be down.

969
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:57,260
Yeah, she got a CD and a CD and an old eight track.

970
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:02,260
She's my own pick-up truck.

971
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:07,260
Never let's be down.

972
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,260
Doc Bates, Missouri.

973
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,260
Missouri.

974
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,260
Missouri.

975
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,260
I'll pick-up truck.

976
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,260
Never let's be down.

977
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,260
I'm K-country.

978
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,260
How you doing, everybody?

979
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,260
Sorry.

980
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,260
I could do that.

981
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,260
I could totally live in some shit-kicking town and just do that.

982
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,260
You don't have a job.

983
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,260
Yeah.

984
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,260
Can you just imagine that?

985
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,260
How does that sound?

986
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,260
I feel like.

987
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,260
Big sound, a K-country.

988
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,260
How you doing, everybody?

989
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,260
It's Adam Curry, bringing you the country and western sound and the blues

990
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,260
that you love the tears to us.

991
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,260
We got it.

992
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,260
Missouri, buy it.

993
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,260
For some violence.

994
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,260
Some get-fiddled.

995
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
Okay, maybe.

996
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,260
Yeah.

997
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,260
We could always move.

998
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,260
Could always move.

999
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,260
I don't think so.

1000
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,260
Well, I could do it.

1001
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,260
I could do it.

1002
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,260
I could do it.

1003
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,260
I'm not a country girl.

1004
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,260
You don't like country music.

1005
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,260
I love country music.

1006
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,260
I really do.

1007
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,260
Yeah, yeah.

1008
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,260
I like it.

1009
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,260
Some songs.

1010
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,260
Of course, there's no country girl in me.

1011
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,260
Do you know when we used to play records backwards?

1012
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,260
Like the Beatles records.

1013
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,260
Yeah, yeah.

1014
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,260
And also the Osborne Black Sabbath.

1015
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,260
You could hear satanic messages.

1016
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,260
Uh-huh.

1017
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,260
You know what happens if you spin that country record backwards?

1018
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,260
You know what happens?

1019
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,260
Uh-huh.

1020
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,260
You get your wife back.

1021
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,260
You get your dog back.

1022
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,260
You get your car back.

1023
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,260
You get it all by.

1024
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,260
Uh-huh.

1025
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,260
Uh-huh.

1026
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,260
Adam C.

1027
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,260
Death Zero from the Area 51 group.

1028
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,260
Amen.

1029
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,260
Let's hear a short show.

1030
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,260
Sorry, 20, man.

1031
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:33,260
And you're talking about not getting enough audio comment.

1032
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,260
Criticism of odd show, odd show plus.

1033
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,260
You probably not going to want to play this something here.

1034
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:46,260
I've got one dippy thing that actually really is kind of making the sight look bad.

1035
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,260
Honestly.

1036
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,260
It's a bit of a sign of the teachers.

1037
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:54,260
The first thing I notice is, join now it's pretty and it is missing an apostrophe.

1038
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,260
And it looks unprofessional.

1039
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,260
It looks like some happens.

1040
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,260
It makes the sight kind of look half-assed.

1041
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,260
Like someone didn't know their grammar.

1042
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,260
Did not approach or eat.

1043
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,260
It is.

1044
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,260
Has an apostrophe.

1045
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,260
Looks unprofessional.

1046
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,260
It's all I can tell you.

1047
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,260
And I know it's from the last thing you guys are worried about.

1048
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,260
You're worried about things breaking.

1049
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:15,260
Otherwise, uh, as a soccerer got myself, I understand that.

1050
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:19,260
Yeah, somebody just needs to get in a photo shop and turn a apostrophe in there.

1051
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,260
It'll be happy.

1052
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,260
It'll probably take you guys a little bit better.

1053
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,260
I'm not sure.

1054
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,260
Now to me.

1055
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,260
Yeah.

1056
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,260
What?

1057
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,260
Well, on pod show plus, we have on the homepage.

1058
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,260
We have, it says, join now it's free.

1059
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,260
Okay.

1060
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,260
And it's, we spelled ITS.

1061
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,260
Yeah.

1062
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,260
And it should be IT apostrophe.

1063
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,260
Oh.

1064
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,260
Oh.

1065
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,260
Oh, no.

1066
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,260
That is important.

1067
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,260
I can never figure that out.

1068
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,260
I thought that.

1069
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,260
The apostrophe was, uh,

1070
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,260
No, because when you leave away,

1071
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,260
No, you leave away.

1072
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,260
You know, you leave a letter.

1073
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,260
It's, it's instead of the letter.

1074
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,260
Yeah.

1075
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,260
I don't know.

1076
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,260
But that's what you're saying.

1077
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,260
It was just such a hard language.

1078
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,260
There's so many exceptions to so many rules.

1079
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,260
You're quite good at it, actually.

1080
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,260
I must say.

1081
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,260
Yeah, you're very good at it.

1082
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,260
Have these things?

1083
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,260
At English?

1084
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,260
Oh, no, I'm not.

1085
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,260
This you are.

1086
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,260
No, I'm, I'm avoiding a lot of words.

1087
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:16,260
Listen, from a girl who, when she was a little girl,

1088
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,260
you used to take the tram and smell sour but in, in water,

1089
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,260
Damn.

1090
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,260
Although, and you've done quite well for yourself.

1091
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,260
You can give the way from Rotterdam.

1092
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,260
Oh, the way from Rotterdam.

1093
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,260
Yes.

1094
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:30,260
So we're planning a couple of trips for the next few weeks.

1095
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,260
Of course Tuesday, I'm going to San Francisco for the lower week.

1096
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,260
Because we have a board meeting.

1097
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,260
I'm looking forward to that.

1098
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,260
Because it's the first meeting in a long time.

1099
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,260
Are you ready?

1100
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,260
Oh, I do.

1101
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,260
Oh, yeah.

1102
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,260
Very much look forward to it.

1103
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,260
Don't you?

1104
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,260
I love it very much.

1105
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,260
I love the company, the people in the company.

1106
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,260
Yeah, you do.

1107
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,260
How are you kidding me?

1108
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,260
Yeah.

1109
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,260
Oh, yeah.

1110
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,260
It's totally makes sense.

1111
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,260
I know you're tired now and then, but you always say, yeah.

1112
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,260
But it's fun.

1113
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,260
I really love what I'm doing.

1114
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,260
I do.

1115
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,260
So there's no bed stress.

1116
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,260
I don't know.

1117
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,260
There's no stress at all.

1118
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,260
Really?

1119
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,260
To be honest.

1120
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,260
So when I come back, then we're going to Euro Disney.

1121
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,260
Yeah.

1122
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,260
That'll be cool.

1123
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:10,260
Kristina wants to go for her birthday and invite some friends.

1124
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,260
Well, she's inviting friends.

1125
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,260
I thought it was just one friend.

1126
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,260
I think it's a bad idea to have two friends.

1127
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,260
Because three is a crowd.

1128
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,260
It never works out.

1129
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,260
It's not a good idea.

1130
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,260
Yeah.

1131
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,260
Not a good idea.

1132
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,260
And we're getting the big ass goofy sweet.

1133
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,260
You and me, baby.

1134
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,260
Yep.

1135
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,260
We'll take the train, the fast train.

1136
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:37,260
It's three hours from Waterloo Station to the heart of the magic king.

1137
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,260
And then we can listen to, it's going to start yet.

1138
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,260
Shadow Falls.

1139
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,260
Shadow Falls.

1140
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,260
Yep.

1141
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,260
We can listen to it.

1142
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,260
Yep.

1143
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,260
That'll be cool.

1144
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,260
Yeah.

1145
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,260
Together.

1146
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,260
Yeah.

1147
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,260
And then we have this Sunday.

1148
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,260
I'm going to take you to a visit Lou.

1149
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,260
Yeah.

1150
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,260
So we're going to fly up to south.

1151
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,260
And that'll be a fun trip.

1152
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,260
Yeah.

1153
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,260
I'm so glad you're taking advantage of your personal, your private pilot.

1154
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,260
Yeah.

1155
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,260
Yeah.

1156
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,260
It's very good.

1157
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,260
And we want to go to the water that plays Captain Dan.

1158
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,260
Said he went to in front of France.

1159
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,260
But they have a beach, like 20 minutes from the air.

1160
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,260
We see that too.

1161
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,260
Yeah.

1162
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,260
Can't wait.

1163
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,260
But no big big picture.

1164
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,260
Don't make people jealous.

1165
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,260
What do you mean?

1166
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,260
Are you kidding me?

1167
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,260
I think all those lovely trips.

1168
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,260
No.

1169
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,260
No.

1170
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,260
I think that the listeners are very happy.

1171
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,260
Yeah.

1172
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,260
I'm going to take that off.

1173
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,260
Yeah.

1174
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,260
They're very happy for me.

1175
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,260
Because we stay home a lot.

1176
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,260
Yeah.

1177
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,260
We work a lot.

1178
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,260
That's true.

1179
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,260
All right, babe.

1180
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,260
What else we got going on?

1181
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,260
Today we want to go out for dinner because Christina's going to go first.

1182
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,260
Go first.

1183
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,260
Yeah.

1184
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,260
So she'll be doing a podcast.

1185
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,260
Yeah.

1186
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,260
I guess over the other day.

1187
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,260
Okay.

1188
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,260
Let's go and have a nice one.

1189
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,260
Can you have you booked anything?

1190
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,260
No.

1191
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,260
No.

1192
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,260
Because it's Friday night.

1193
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,260
You know, Gilford is quite popular.

1194
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,260
True.

1195
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,260
Yes.

1196
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,260
But maybe everybody used to go for dinner.

1197
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,260
At the Gilfest.

1198
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,260
It's a Gilfest.

1199
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,260
So yeah.

1200
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,260
I'll do that.

1201
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,260
What do you want to go?

1202
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,260
We're dressed for it.

1203
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,260
We're not going to say because then people are going to look at us.

1204
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,260
Yeah.

1205
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,260
All right.

1206
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,260
Yeah.

1207
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,260
I was bothered by the way.

1208
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,260
I haven't heard him in a long time.

1209
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,260
They were not with Roger.

1210
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,260
Maybe somebody's talking to him?

1211
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,260
Marcus Mowler from pot you HQ sent me an email.

1212
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,260
How's that?

1213
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,260
What's that?

1214
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,260
I don't have that.

1215
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:24,260
Maybe there else some mama the half.

1216
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,260
What?

1217
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,260
I said awesome mama.

1218
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,260
Yeah.

1219
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,260
That's the province where camps committee.

1220
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,260
Yeah.

1221
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,260
Yeah.

1222
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,260
Yeah.

1223
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:35,260
Um, was turned over to Iraqi forces today.

1224
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,260
Uh, what the hell is going on?

1225
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,260
What is that?

1226
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,260
What time is it?

1227
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,260
Is it maybe...

1228
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,260
Oh, Barbara.

1229
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,260
Barbara.

1230
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,260
Can you just close the door for a second then, huh?

1231
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,260
Um, sorry.

1232
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,260
Oh, it's not Barbara.

1233
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,260
I know that.

1234
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,260
What is it?

1235
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,260
Oh, it's somebody outside.

1236
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,260
Oh, okay.

1237
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,260
Uh, anyway, Camp Smitty is the, uh,

1238
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,260
the camp that I stayed at for about 10 days

1239
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:04,260
and did a live broadcast when the Dutch marines were there.

1240
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,260
Um, the, uh, the Japanese were just just arriving as we were leaving.

1241
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,260
Um, uh, the bridge weren't there yet.

1242
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:15,260
Um, so now they've, uh, they've left, uh, the province.

1243
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:19,260
It's secure and it's in hands of, uh, the Iraqi security forces.

1244
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,260
Yeah.

1245
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,260
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

1246
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,260
That's very good.

1247
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,260
Well, some of the work was actually real.

1248
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,260
Some of the stuff that was going on there.

1249
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,260
No, they did a good job.

1250
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,260
Absolutely.

1251
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,260
I still, I'm still waiting for my invitation to go to Afghanistan.

1252
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,260
Totally would go.

1253
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,260
Don't give me that face.

1254
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,260
Please don't give me that face.

1255
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,260
Don't give me that face, baby.

1256
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,260
All right.

1257
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,260
Anything else for the peeps before we, uh,

1258
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,260
check out into the weekend?

1259
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:50,260
Let me think, is there anything else?

1260
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,260
No.

1261
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,260
No.

1262
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,260
Yes, absolutely nothing going on in your life.

1263
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,260
Look, the sun is out now.

1264
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,260
It's because it was a little bit windy, but it's very nice.

1265
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,260
Mm-hmm.

1266
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:05,260
And I need a very nice relaxing weekend.

1267
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,260
Okay.

1268
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,260
That's what I want.

1269
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,260
Well, I'm going to be gone Saturday.

1270
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:11,260
I'll be gone Saturday, so you can have a nice relaxing Saturday.

1271
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,260
Of course.

1272
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,260
I will wake you up when I get up in the morning.

1273
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,260
Of course.

1274
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,260
Of course.

1275
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:20,260
You know, because Williams arriving 930, so I'll probably leave the house around 915.

1276
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,260
I'm sorry.

1277
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,260
You know, this is why I want separate bedrooms.

1278
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,260
I keep saying this is a good idea.

1279
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:30,260
We have our date, and then we can, you know, we can have dinner and then come back.

1280
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,260
And of course, we're seeing there won't be here tonight.

1281
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,260
And then we can do all kinds of dirty things.

1282
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,260
And then you can go to bed on time.

1283
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,260
And I can sit up and then...

1284
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,260
Hang on.

1285
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,260
It's chandelier.

1286
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,260
Yes.

1287
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,260
And then I can play around until whenever I feel I want to go to bed.

1288
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,260
Well, we have to find the right house.

1289
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,260
Oh.

1290
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,260
Here you can have your bedroom.

1291
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,260
Hey, baby.

1292
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,260
Oh.

1293
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,260
And you can sign the first day.

1294
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,260
No.

1295
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,260
Really?

1296
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,260
You're not saying that?

1297
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,260
Maybe it's worth it.

1298
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,260
Oh, yeah.

1299
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,260
First day.

1300
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,260
I let Trissoty.

1301
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:04,260
When you walk in, you set my circuit tree.

1302
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,260
Back it up.

1303
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,260
We've got to do it.

1304
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:10,260
When people swear it out, you always play cool.

1305
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,260
I think I know you feel.

1306
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,260
I'm going a bit.

1307
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,260
And you lock through what you're.

1308
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,260
And don't get it.

1309
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,260
Get your quit fix.

1310
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,260
In my car.

1311
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,260
You got a sweet truth and I'm your chocolate bar.

1312
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,260
Oh, no, no, no.

1313
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,260
Oh, no, no, no.

1314
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,260
Ah, no, nothing.

1315
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,260
Hey.

1316
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,260
Hey.

1317
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:33,260
Oh, you kiss provocers.

1318
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,260
Cause I do.

1319
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,260
Cause I do.

1320
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,260
Cause I do.

1321
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,260
Cause I do.

1322
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,260
Cause I do.

1323
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,260
New ya'll down.

1324
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:55,260
Yeah, I'm the catwalk, I like to play it to squid

1325
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,260
You don't really want to show, spray paint you

1326
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,260
Touching you

1327
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,260
And cruise yourself, don't be wrong

1328
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:06,260
So take a chance, give me a shot

1329
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,260
You think I'm bluffing, I think I'm not

1330
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,260
Get on your high heels, give me a heart attack

1331
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:16,260
I got a question for your sweet ass

1332
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:20,260
No, no, no, no, no, no

1333
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:27,260
In that sense, do you kiss all the first hue?

1334
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:31,260
Do you kiss all the first hue?

1335
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,260
Do you kiss all the first hue?

1336
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,260
Do you kiss all the first hue?

1337
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,260
Do you kiss all the first hue?

1338
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:45,260
Do you kiss all the first hue?

1339
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,260
Do you kiss all the first hue?

1340
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:50,460
Cause I do, do you do what I do, and with you

1341
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,260
If you do, what you do, what I do

1342
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,260
I'm good at you

1343
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,460
We're a little baby, you look so hot tonight

1344
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,660
Can I hold your hand?

1345
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,260
I'm thinking

1346
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,660
Now this is what we're going to do in our day today

1347
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,460
We're going to do all the things all the couples like to do

1348
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,260
We're going to go more movie

1349
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,260
We're going to have some dinner, take a walk

1350
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,460
Look at the moonlight, anything you want but baby

1351
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,660
I got a question

1352
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:50,260
Because I do, because I do, because I do, because I do, because I do, because I do

00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,260
Dango Jones, I like that

1355
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,260
Do you kiss on the first date?

1356
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,260
Yeah, right in the bus he was in a proper way

1357
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,260
Did I kiss on the first date?

1358
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,260
Then, shack on the first date

1359
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,260
Don't, shack on the first date

1360
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,260
No, no, no, no

1361
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,260
All right

1362
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:08,260
I take a look at that

1363
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,260
That's a good song

1364
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:10,260
You've heard it before

1365
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,260
Yeah, I could sing it

1366
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,260
Yeah, yeah

1367
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,260
Gee, it's just like

1368
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:17,740
Just like real hits, not amazing.

1369
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,740
Do you chag on the first date?

1370
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,860
Don't chag on the first date.

1371
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,460
Uh, I'd take it you haven't checked out

1372

No.

00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:27,620

My dream.

1384
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,900
Mm-hmm.

I enjoy your life the way you are here in the house.

1386
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,900
The other day Patricia said to me,

1387
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,900
I'm just living your life.

1388
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,900
I'm just living your life.

1389
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,900
Yeah.

1390
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:56,900
Yeah.

1391
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:57,900
But not, you know, in a bad way.

1392
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:58,900
It's pretty exciting.

1393
00:45:58,900 --> 00:45:59,900
No, in my life.

1394
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,900
It's very exciting.

1395
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:01,900
No.

1396
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:02,900
What?

1397
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,900
All right, baby.

1398
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,900
So, uh, we have a date tonight?

Yes, we do.

1400
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,900
Oh, I'm going to rip you apart.

1401
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,900
Oh, God.

1402
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:11,900
Okay.
