Delta's Yeracharly 372.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You gotta get angry.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You gotta get me.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That's the only way you can play.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I guess I'm not really an angry person.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You're an angry now.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And you as per sit in my ear.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Those amazing works I never thought I had.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And she said,

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Just close your eyes.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Lay our hands out.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And let your friends see us stay.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
All of them now, because I can take you over this down tonight.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
On my magic cup, it's all on time.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll take you away from the rising light.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The places you've never ever been before.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:38,000
As we passed in your bonestar,

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But she said,

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You remember to sew,

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Stroke back with feels.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That I'll sweat all the dreams.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And I'm dead in the ceiling like red

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Who we played, I didn't see.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And she said,

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Just close your eyes.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Lay our hands out.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000

And I'm dead in the ceiling like red.

40

And I'm dead in the ceiling like red.

60
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And I'm dead in the ceiling like red.

61
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,440
I was on television in the Netherlands and people project their baggage on to me with great

62
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:01,560
frequency and certainly in the last two years with podcasting, words are scrutinized, things

63
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,320
are, are looked at over and over again and people always love to post and start flame wars

64
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,080
and I rarely ever get into them because well with the written word, I really can't win.

65
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,360
I'm no good at it, but when you get into my realm into the realm of audio entertainment,

66
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:22,600
you get into podcasting, and particularly when you accuse me of bigotry, then I'm going

67
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:30,040
to respond to it and I've been thinking about, in fact, I didn't even sleep well last night

68
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:37,040
because of what I heard yesterday on Madge Weinstein's yeast radio episode number 366.

69
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:44,080
I actually tried to, excuse me, I actually tried to hook up with Madge for a Skype call

70
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,480
to discuss this, but I guess Madge was somewhere in hotel and was checking out and was traveling

71
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,600
so it didn't work, but maybe that's actually better because now I've had some time to collect

72
00:07:52,600 --> 00:08:00,480
my thoughts, there's an eight-minute rant at the beginning of this yeast radio episode which

73
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:13,000
really hurt me and it's so incredibly stupid in my mind that I almost, for a couple of

74
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,640
minutes, I've actually thought, wow, maybe this is just the publicity stunt, I mean it's

75
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:26,360
so lame and so off-target, particularly for me, my background as you know is I grew up in Amsterdam,

76
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,840
which is the Netherlands, one of the most tolerant societies in the world of multicultural,

77
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:39,360
multicultural, multilingual society and everyone just lets everybody else kind of live and

78
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,680
do what they do and I've always been that way and I've never, and by the way a country that

79
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:53,520
is dealt with horrible, horrible, bigotry and prejudice in the past 50 years think of the

80
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,480
second world war and how many Dutch Jews were annihilated, shipped off to concentration camps.

81
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:05,280
So I grew up with very clear values, not just instilled by my parents but instilled by the culture

82
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,400
of the country. So for someone to call me a bigot, now you really, you really get my blood boiling.

83
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:16,640
So that said, I have to preface what you're about to hear and the rest of the show with the fact

84
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:23,840
that it is a total exercise in freedom of speech and you will hear some very profound things

85
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,640
and some very profane things and I think those two often go hand in hand which is probably

86
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,240
why I get them mixed up all the time and I've done my homework and done a little bit of research

87
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,680
and let's see if we can get to the bottom of this and then hopefully move on after that because

88
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:47,840
I'll accept a lot of things but I will not accept the label of a bigot or someone who discriminates

89
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:59,600
based upon anyone's features, beliefs, heritage, etc. Okay so this is and actually I was very unaware

90
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,720
that this was a huge issue but apparently it is a huge issue until I do listen to you know

91
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,080
you know I listened to as many podcasts as possible and I listened to yeast radio yesterday

92
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:22,480
which started off like this. Imagine seeing a hair coming to you from the car, a Chevy Cavalier,

93
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,680
with a license plate in the front that says freedom. Never forget 9 11 with an American

94
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,880
plant flag and a lesbian. My name is Bad Weinstein this is serious. I was one or two and he's

95
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:46,000
radio dot com and I'm very angry today. I'm angry because my boss Ampery allows

96
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:54,160
they get into homophobics ridiculous statements on his show. Okay I'm going to stop right here

97
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,240
because I do want to set the stage properly because I'm going to be as I always am completely open

98
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,680
and honest and to start off Mad Weinstein you're not honest your name is Richard Bluestein you are a

99
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:13,680
white male and from what you've told me you're a homosexual white male and you are not a woman

100
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:21,520
you are not a lesbian in fact when I first heard Mad Weinstein and this is some big confusion as well

101
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:29,440
when I first heard Mad Weinstein in January of 2005 I was elated. I was so happy because here was

102
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,240
I was listening to someone in those early shows which I think were the best that has ever been

103
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:45,440
produced for East Radio. I truly believed here was a transgendered man from Chicago or a trans

104
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:53,840
sexual or transvestite but anyway very clearly someone who has a recognizable type of

105
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:03,600
self image who was just angry and pissed off and I really really enjoyed listening to that and I was

106
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:11,360
completely dismayed when I found that was where some confusion came in the register of all places

107
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,040
was so stupid to think that I didn't understand that Mad wasn't really a woman no I thought that

108
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,840
this was truly a transvestite a transgendered person who was just angry at the world and venting

109
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:30,000
on a podcast okay but when I found out that it's all an act because Richard Bluestein is a very

110
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,560
nice, very calm almost introverted person when you meet him face to face so just so you know that

111
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:44,320
this is a lie to start off with that Mad Weinstein is not a lesbian is not a woman

112
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:53,280
and I found out from Mrs. Slokum because he heard the show before me she whatever her it

113
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:01,360
that Adam's curry played this promo for some idiots that that referred to exam as a bunch of

114
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:09,360
faggots okay so before we go any further let's go back to daily source code episode 3-6-9

115
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,560
and listen to this is the second time I've played the promo actually this promo was first played

116
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,360
a couple months ago and I didn't catch it then and nothing really nothing really offended me then

117
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,240
although the second time I heard it and you'll actually hear this because I'm not just going to

118
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,640
play the promo I'm going to play a clip from the actual the hell was that stop it I'm angry over here

119
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,880
I'm going to play you a I'm going to so I'm going to play you this clip that

120
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,400
well you'll actually hear what I respond to because I cracked the microphone when I heard something

121
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,800
about fucking the guy at the ass or whatever it was and was like whoa you know that I hadn't actually

122
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,360
caught that one before and I heard nothing at all wrong with what was being said let's listen to it

123
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,000
and you listen in and then we'll talk about that in a second and we'll continue with Mad just

124
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
see you there

125
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,840
it's a me on the baby countdown I'm out now top one two with three I'm going to take that spot now

126
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,640
where you can drive down the jigsaw radio to be specific and I'll add to nature if you want to

127
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,120
come get it you're the best how you say yeah I'm serious when my fucking bag is that next

128
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,240
little I think you'll be in some line so there you go fuck this the faggot's at xm

129
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,040
now I believe that what the guys from hood hype who are not idiots by the way I think they do

130
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,200
a fantastic show and it's very difficult for a R&B in hip-hop to get played on the radio

131
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:38,160
outside of all the bubblegum crap that is being plugged day in day out but this was not

132
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:46,000
derogatory towards homosexuals this is a use of a word in the same way Mad Weinstein

133
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,680
the Richard Bluestein that you use the word Kant and I would never ever use the word Kant

134
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,560
directed towards a woman or a group of women and nor would you or should you so I think it's

135
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:07,360
there if all of xm was one group of homosexuals then I would have said well wait a minute that's

136
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,840
a problem but now it's being now there's a term being used which by the way I had no idea and

137
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:20,480
that's unfortunate that this is how we have to have this conversation I had no idea that that was deemed

138
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,840
a very offensive word I can understand if I said to someone who's gay I said hey you fag

139
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,800
but this is I think there's a distinct difference and of course as we get into this I'd really

140
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,240
like to know what is okay and what is not okay are we allowed to say queer are we allowed to say

141
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,480
queen or we allowed to say light-footed you know what what are we allowed to say if we are talking

142
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,840
about homosexuals should we say homosexuals should we say gay you really got to educate me on this

143
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:56,880
topic okay so I didn't respond to that because this is clearly the guys at Hood Hype saying

144
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,800
serious rocks xm sucks and this is just the way they happen to say it and I didn't pick up on it in

145
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,720
fact I did pick up on something I did find it maybe a little bit offensive for someone to listen

146
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:22,880
you'll hear me respond to that here okay and by the way as hip-hop lyrics go I have heard a lot

147
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:30,960
worse now when you use the word republican I think that is derogatory and in fact I think the

148
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:38,880
continuous use of that word match wine scene creates an even wider divide that we in the united

149
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,480
states then we have already between democrats republicans red states blue states that's actually

150
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:53,040
calling someone a name based upon what they are and xm is obviously not a satellite station full of homosexuals

151
00:17:53,680 --> 00:18:00,560
okay so to take this to the extreme extreme and saying that I'm allowing bigots to a promo

152
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,840
and idiots I'm among idiots by the way you're calling them idiots to promo something that is

153
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:14,160
bigotry on my show is just wrong okay it's just wrong now I do understand your point if it's offensive okay

154
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,200
and when people say hey I was offended by that I always respond in the same manner we'll get to that in a

155
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,720
second let's continue now and then so I thought well that's terrible and then I'm turning on

156
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,320
listening to Howard Stern Howard Stern every other word is fact fact fact and Howard talks about how

157
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:36,160
gay people should get married all the time he clearly clearly knows supports supports gay people

158
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:43,200
in terms of his I think his intention is actions but you know when you just use it

159
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:51,520
fact to uh to uh insult you know anyone like the all your derogatory word kind of like I use

160
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,760
kind right that refers to my hatred of women right okay so you actually are coming out and saying

161
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,120
you hate women and you don't really Richard it's your act okay this is the magic act that you hate

162
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,360
women and that's why you call them cons and because it's an act which by the way I don't always find

163
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,120
funny it seems to be okay all right and by the way the fact that you bring Howard Stern and

164
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:20,400
to this really started to convince me that you actually were doing this just to get some kind of

165
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,800
publicity going or some kind of controversy uh hopefully and I know that you're a Howard wannabe

166
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,840
I've seen you do a time and time again unsuccessfully I've seen you even bring in a black woman

167
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,680
to be your co-host trying to get a Robin Quiver's type of vibe so that's the only thing I could think

168
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:44,240
there now um you compliment Howard on his actions and uh you don't do that with me I'm not looking

169
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:51,920
for any compliments I'm not looking for uh for any uh any pets on the shoulder but please please don't

170
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:58,320
tell me that my actions haven't proven that I'm anything but a bigot that I'm anything but prejudice

171
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,280
and then I don't care about anyone what they say what they do who they have sex with how they

172
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:11,840
have sex in their private lives I don't care I have consistently given the gay community the same

173
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:18,560
access to everything that pod show has to offer everything that I personally have to offer okay

174
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,760
you don't mention that but I do sign your check and I actually don't sign your check and that's another

175
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:33,920
point I really despise the lie that I am your boss I am not your boss you know damn well what our

176
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:39,520
relationship is this is the same with every single podcast and every producer of a podcast every podcast

177
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,840
that we have a deal with I am not your boss I cannot tell you what to do I cannot kick you off the

178
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:54,240
network so to position me as I'm your boss and ooh boy aren't you the really big man now because

179
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,280
you're going against the man you're going I'm not your boss okay and you know it so that's bullshit

180
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,320
but that doesn't work because I am a woman and I am a lesbian you see how that works

181
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,320
how it turns out is it white male Adam Curry white male Richard bluestine white male okay

182
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,000
you don't know if I'm gay you don't know if I'm bisexual you don't know if I like being fucked

183
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,600
up the ass you don't know that I just mind I'm 41 years old I think have been around the block I

184
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,440
think I know what life has to offer I think I've explored the limits of my sexuality I don't need

185
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:37,360
to exploit that for a laugh like you do so yeah and they excuse that you don't listen to your

186
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,840
own show sorry that doesn't hold water anymore you used that one before but the cancer shit

187
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,240
excuse me this is two very different things I never said I don't listen to my own show I said I

188
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,640
hadn't previewed the cancer the promo where a joke was made about cancer I could have easily

189
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,880
not aired that show we went through that before this is something completely different and I

190
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,120
stand behind the promo from hood hype I stand behind it because it is something completely different

191
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,200
now let me just see if he talks about Mr. Slokham here so you know what and you wonder why you

192
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:22,720
now okay so I did get exactly one email about this from I guess Jeffrey Taylor is Mrs. Slokham

193
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:31,760
and it's not a long email it's one paragraph I'm gonna read it to you right now Jeffrey Taylor says

194
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,840
and it sent to me and copied to bloated lesbian at gmail.com mages email address

195
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:46,080
disappointing that you let the fuck the faggots at xm comment from hood hype promo flot pormo flies

196
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:52,880
as pormo atom the context of the epitets usage promotes anti-gay hate speech and perpetuates the

197
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:59,920
notion that faggot is an okay pejorative the national mental health association estimates that high

198
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:06,320
school students in the US here degrading words like faggots 26 times a day and contributing to

199
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,080
the culture of having faggot be the ultimate insult in US youth and urban culture also contributes

200
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:18,000
to the thousands of suicides by marginalized kids each year I request that you address what may have

201
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,240
been a careless mistake saying shit like that is not okay at all so I responded sorry

202
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:41,200
didn't even hear that part sorry I didn't hear anything derogatory and to say I mean what pedestal are

203
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:48,480
you putting yourself on here look at the world around you there are kids who are killing themselves

204
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,200
by throwing up every day because of magazines that project an image of what they should be

205
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,480
young girls are starving themselves to death we have hundreds of thousands of kids who are

206
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,080
fucking homeless who have no parents do you have one did you adopt a kid today to save them

207
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,760
oh no we're going to go on a little faggot rant against the pod father the boss

208
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:15,440
that really really tick me off and it's bullshit because it wasn't used in a derogatory fashion

209
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:22,880
in a derogatory way towards homeless sexual's it's a fucking word okay it's a word

210
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,320
that's gonna eat this that show why don't gay people listen to uh Richard you don't know

211
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:35,520
of gay people listen to my show you don't know that and I don't care who listens to my show

212
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:43,920
and if the bothers you don't listen and I do not wonder why I didn't I never said on eat this

213
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:50,080
hot show which was a stupid interview which was insulting to me because all that could come out

214
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,360
of the mouths of the three-part people who were interviewing me on the show was do I take it up the

215
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,600
ass who would I fuck who would I kill who would I marry why haven't keeping the girl been

216
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:05,440
signed a pod show really intellectual guys too I had him carries part whatever that thing is

217
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,840
silly source code well maybe it's because they don't want to be called a fucking faggot like they

218
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:15,440
did when they were in fucking eighth grade asshole okay who's the asshole here have you

219
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,880
listened to your own show do you wonder why you're not making a dent politically which you'd love

220
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:27,040
to do because you keep calling republicans republicans the language that comes out of your mouth

221
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:34,240
is atrocious and it's directed specifically at the people who you're trying to put down unlike

222
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,240
what I did here you know and I'm just sick of it not listening to how it I'm listening everything

223
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,600
and I like how it but it's like why does every other word have to be faggot faggot you know

224
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,080
I don't give a shit how famous you are whatever there's that's just shallow eight per behavior

225
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,760
so I have a question for Adam per ever quest for our certain which is what is the difference

226
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,560
between calling somebody a faggot and calling somebody a nigger or a chink or a cike

227
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:11,520
or calling someone a cunt what's the difference explain it to me why is it okay

228
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:20,000
to call somebody a fag or a faggot but it's not okay to call a black person a nigger or a

229
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,360
Chinese person a chink I'll tell you why I'll tell you what the difference is okay

230
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:32,320
because there is no difference if you're black it's okay to say nigger have you not noticed that

231
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,560
if you're gay it's okay to say faggot and you do it all the time

232
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,800
Kanye West she's a gold digger the the biggest in your face example

and it's one thing to do it as a joke but this is not a laughing matter Richard and you can ask

266
00:30:53,840 --> 00:31:06,080
made a very let's say an artistic skits about to chopping men's dicks off when they're in the glory hole

267
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:14,160
that's hands in addition to getting it as furry as by calling that a period big herd fag now that

268
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:22,400
is so incredibly unfair of you to say that mark you're motor nemcalf quote got to where he is

269
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,320
by calling me a big herd fag which by the way we've been going on with this joke for quite a while

270
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,800
never heard a peep from anyone because you don't think I'm gay you don't think I'm homosexual you don't

271
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,200
think I'm bisexual you don't think that I might have any kind of kinky things going on it might be

272
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,320
offended by the word fag you know what I'm not you can call me anything you will sticks and

273
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:52,160

274
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:58,560
dignation with wiki pedia people have said the most hurtful things I have to give you some credit

275
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:05,040
there magic you did come to my defense but not for all the nasty things that people said and mark

276
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,520
Yoshimoto Namco is a very very talented writer very talented performer and I happen to think he's

277
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,360
very funny and has nothing to do with his big-haired fag comment getting him to where he is it's

278
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:25,280
because we came up with a business relationship a business deal just like you and I know different

279
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,080
whatsoever you know there is a difference he actually makes me laugh yeah I'm just thinking

280
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:37,280
here in that word fucking everywhere you know what I mean it's a fucking word and if you're going to

281
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,600
do it then I want to hear you say nigger I want to hear you say spick I want to hear you insult

282
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,360
every single race now why do you have to push that on me why do you have to push your

283
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,960
thinking on to everybody else you've done this before and privately we've had this conversation

284
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,640
Richard we had this conversation where you said I want to have Steve Webb from life spring on my podcast

285
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,800
but I'm going to make a deal with him the deal is he has to he has to say I'm sorry I shouldn't do the

286
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:11,120
voice he has to say that gay people can get married under the eyes of God and I said to you I said why

287
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,240
you do that why do you want to force your lifestyle on somebody else he's not forcing his lifestyle

288
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:31,360
on you in fact Steve Webb who sent in a very civil comment to me about using Jesus Christ

289
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:38,880
in in what he felt were inappropriate matters we had a real conversation about it you know

290
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,720
not just all this hatred that you're spewing all of a sudden and I'm so pissed off we had a civil

291
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,960
conversation but he didn't try to force his religion on me he only said hey you know this is what I feel

292
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:58,160
about it and guess what we didn't have Muslims sending in comments saying well this is fucked up

293
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:03,360
shit oh you're doing his promoting Christianity didn't have any Jewish people sending comments in

294
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,840
saying well that's fucked up no it seems to come from the same place time and time again like you're

295
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:15,680
so fucking underprivileged will you're not you're a white male living in America you should be happy

296
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:23,360
and proud and color preference and all that shit because I or explain to me why it's okay

297
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,160
to say Fag and Fag at every five seconds I don't say it every five seconds you're trying to get

298
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:34,000
on the Howard Stern show is what you're trying to do and it's pathetic which results in that kind of hate

299
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:43,520
I disagree I totally disagree by the way Richard you're overweight you're fat I think that

300
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:49,920
people being called fat as a kid is a hell of a lot worse and causes a lot more damage than being

301
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:56,320
called a Fag in the eighth grade when you might not even know what the fucking word means and there are

302
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,040
kids who kill themselves all the time mainly because their parents are assholes results in thousands

303
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,480
of kids that kill themselves every year not to mention the fact that in some countries other people

304
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,600
kill take care of that for you oh okay right so now what are going to do we're going to

305
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:20,160
equate our society to other countries where they kill homosexuals and it's not just homosexuals

306
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,840
by the way they kill Christians they kill Jews you're not alone in this you don't have like some

307
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:31,440
kind of special little everyone hates me club except for the one that exists in your mind get over

308
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:38,240
it like our occupied or act like a ran where people get hung literally for being gay yeah I'm

309
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:45,120
fucking sick of it now we're taking it just too far I don't give a shit who you are if you're my fucking

310
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:51,360
boss so see now there you go again trying to be the big man I'm not your boss don't lie tell the truth

311
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,840
tell everyone what our arrangement is I can't tell you what to do in your show I can't stop you

312
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:01,680
from putting anything in your show I can't stop you from publishing anything in your show I am not your boss

313
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:10,160
it's a lie it's a fucking lie and it really that really pisses me off you're full of shit whatever it's

314
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:17,120
bullshit it is total fucking bullshit why am I saying this on my show because I want to get it played that's

315
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,720
yeah you know what there you go there's another clue

316
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,280
nudge Weinstein is sent in several audio comments that I thought were so unfunny just not fucking funny

317
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,960
that I didn't plan so I think that you're upset and worried that I wouldn't address the issue

318
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:40,240
and that's why you put it on yeast radio and lie about things about me being your boss you're not a big

319
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:51,280
a big you are big get big imploded but you're not all of a sudden fucking super here on ooo look at how

320
00:36:51,280 --> 00:37:01,600
dangerous this is look at this look at the high stakes on playing uh uh not true no I don't like it

321
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:07,200
because they're usually not funny what I like is the pissed off match this is actually a very good

322
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,120
example I really do like it when you're pissed off and I really do like it when you go off in the

323
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:16,880
rant and you're one trick pony that's what you do best give up all the rest okay give up the

324
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,960
Florence night and gale bit give up trying to be Howard Stern give up trying to be funny and video

325
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:29,280
because you're not your one trick and your one trick is good and stick to it uh now again I have

326
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:36,080
controversy on my show but it's probably why don't I I am not at all about controversy on my show okay

327
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,600
that's the way you think and you're trying to put your baggage onto me because that is exactly what's

328
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:47,920
happening here you want the controversy because you want to have the attention which is so

329
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:54,160
typical for you okay well I played it for a second he didn't even hear that comment give me a

330
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:01,200
fucking break I did not hear a bigot comment I did not hear bigotry I heard people just talking

331
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:08,960
okay not directed towards homosexuals if Hood Hype had said those faggot's a cue potter

332
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:21,040
I never would have played it never you know you just insulted people do you realize that oh

333
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,960
but it's okay I guess right if you're gay then you're allowed to insult other people

334
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,640
you I mean you started using the word nigger you started using the word chink what happened to

335
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:39,280
you you forgot that one kike spick what happened to all that oh because you're in some kind of

336
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,360
quote minority which I don't believe I think there's a hell of a lot more gay people who are afraid

337
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:54,000
afraid to come out because of this because they don't want to be represented by assholes like you

338
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:01,920
somebody's been calling them a faggot fuck that bullshit all you had to do was say you know I'm not

339
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:08,080
really comfortable with that word would you take that into consideration instead you call me a bigot

340
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:14,800
which I'm not and you know it and fuck words my actions speak for themselves and you should address those

341
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,240
you know and then you apologize for saying Jesus Christ as your friend radios I've been

342
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:26,320
oh no I'm not afraid I'm going to offend Steve Webb and you clearly have some bug up

343
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:35,280
your ass about that because someone else believes that same sex partner shouldn't get married

344
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,480
under the eyes of God and you have a problem with it you can't seem to handle it that's what that's

345
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:47,520
about I don't care if I offend Steve Webb I care if people say to me hey you know I have an issue

346
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:56,960
with that and I'm a listener of the show I'm working up a sweat here you know I thought to

347
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,400
ask you know that is such fucking bullshit so you wonder why people don't listen to deli so

348
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:10,000
no I don't wonder why people don't listen to daily source code and it's a lie the numbers continue to

349
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:20,560
increase okay and clearly you're listening clearly Zilla Fag is listening clearly Mrs. Slokham is

350
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:31,280
listening they're not tuning out they're tuning in so I've never said I wonder why no I said

351
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:41,680
why don't queue potters send me promos that's what I wondered okay nothing more nothing

352
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,200
let's go back and listen to the show I've never wondered about any group based upon

353
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,520
background heritage race religion or sexual preference if they listen to my show or not I mean

354
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,600
that's what podcasting is about I'll say what I want I say and I say it from the heart

355
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:10,400
all the time I never hold back certainly not in this case no they said me promos they suck

356
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:15,920
most of the promos are so stupid and so full of stupid language that I don't want to

357
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,640
offend the rest of the world with the idiocy that I get sent as promos once in a while they're okay

358
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:26,320
but here's an example magic you send me a nice little bit and talk about the golden tick and

359
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:37,200
then all of a sudden oh no I have a golden shower for you ha ha ha ha ha ha I don't need anyone

360
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,400
to kiss my ass unless I request it and I've had my ass kissed in a sexual fashion I really didn't

361
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,640
joy it I'll have you know our faces or our ears I don't know it doesn't work that

362
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:53,920
fucking way does it so you know just be equal if you're gonna say fact good fine say fact

363
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,640
but I want to hear nigger I want to hear a chink I want to hear a spit and I want to hear

364
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:06,240
some way to insult white people this is so stupid this is so incredibly stupid do you hear

365
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:14,160
yourself do you hear yourself and I want to hear that I want to hear it all yeah well you use

366
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:20,720
that all the time particularly directed towards women who you just said you hate you hate you hate

367
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,040
now do I really believe you hate women now probably not but you're so frustrated so

368
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,680
first and I know where this is coming from you are frustrated because you don't have the success

369
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:39,280
you feel you deserve and I've heard this before there was a big conversation a big thread

370
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:46,320
in the Q-Potter community why don't gay actors get to play the role of gay people in movies

371
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,720
because they're talented as nothing to do with whether they're gay or not it's because they're

372
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:59,760
talented capital T okay all of it's every and so or not at all or you can just explain to me

373
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:06,320
why saying faggot is okay it may be it's not derogatory but let's hear your argument maybe you

374
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:11,840
have one okay what I want to hear from you as first of all I'm going to restate it again

375
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:20,320
in this case this was not derogatory towards homosexuals you tell me what words are okay match

376
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,800
is it okay to use faggot if I'm talking amongst faggot's who are friends

377
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:33,680
like zilifag said potsay music from a faggot is it okay to say queer is it okay to say queen

378
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:40,960
is it okay to say gay tell me what can I say what will not offend you have a decent normal

379
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,320
conversation with me will ya but I think it's fucking bullshit you know and I think this gay people

380
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:51,440
we need to stand up for ourselves every fucking time people try to marginalize us no I did not

381
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:58,800
marginalize you my action speak exactly to the contrary I've done everything but try to marginalize

382
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:06,640
quite the opposite I've given you the exact same access the exact same resources the exact same

383
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:12,800
respect that anyone else gets from me anywhere in private life or in business life

384
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,640
because it's not fair yeah you can we can entertain you with our queer eye for the fucking

385
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:24,480
I don't watch queer eye for the fucking straight guy I'm not interested in that show

386
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:34,080
it doesn't entertain me at all I don't watch gay themed entertainment because it's funny because

387
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:40,080
it's gay I don't do that your problem is with Hollywood baby it's fucking Hollywood it's

388
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:45,040
get over it already and make a difference stop bitching and make a difference and do something

389
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:54,720
funny and entertaining for a change okay that'll help no I did not see broke back mountain

390
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:01,440
then have absolutely no desire to see it that's a movie that is only interesting for the American

391
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:08,080
audience who have been so suppressed that you can't even talk about homosexuality anywhere

392
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:14,720
except in a gay club we're in a gay community that's where you should be working on

393
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:23,680
I don't get entertained by that I don't have to see men hug by the way it's beautiful one

394
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,960
men hug it's beautiful one women hug and kiss and cuddle and make love and have sex

395
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:40,880
anyone can have sex with anyone I don't give a shit and I say as I do when I do as I say

396
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,480
you're only in the free cage that lives in your mind okay it lives in your mind and you've got

397
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:59,680
to break free from that you need serious help you really do because there's no physical cage

398
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:05,200
it's in your head the only restrictions that are placed are you are the ones that you place on your

399
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,560
self and you know what with the language that is used in your show the language that is used

400
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:19,840
in as an example of another cue potter show the Zilla Zilla Fag show excuse me that's what turns

401
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:28,880
people off because it's so easy to say mother fucker Kant bitch it's so easy to do that why don't

402
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:36,560
you try and get some new vocabulary okay like watching some fucking these DL even the

403
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:42,640
they fuck you all you know and why are cute potters in so you have the nerve to say what do you

404
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,120
insular because this is exactly what you're doing you're bitching and moaning about things that are

405
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:54,320
not true you're lying about it propagating lies that I'm your boss I don't even know if you listen

406
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:59,920
to the fucking show in fact everything that I'm hearing tells me you didn't you just read the email

407
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,760
from Jeffrey and when oh fuck that shit did you actually listen to the hood high problem

408
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,200
did you actually consider that this was not directed towards gaze did you consider that at all

409
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:17,520
oh sorry can I say gay can I say gays can I say homosexuals please tell me what words I can use

410
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:23,120
or insular because we treat each other like equals and I don't treat you like equals that

411
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:28,880
what you're telling me I want you to tell me that when I have not treated you with the exact

412
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,720
same respect as anyone else that I encounter in my life personal business business wise tell me

413
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,280
and tell me the same about fucking pod show the company that run and I've built from the ground up

414
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:44,640
tell me the company that you are a part of you're insulting me you're insulting the company

415
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:50,720
and it's based on lies because the rest of the world evidently thinks we're just a work to

416
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:58,960
call somebody you know that is so lame the rest of the world oh look at poor me the rest of

417
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:05,040
if I took on that attitude every single time I got yelled at flamed and called the most ugly

418
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:12,240
things that you can imagine hurtful names not necessarily based on my homosexuality but I've

419
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:19,920
had I've been called a fag a lot more than you imagine a hell of a lot more my entire professional

420
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:28,960
career I've been called a fag a pansy boy doesn't bother me because I switch it off in my brain

421
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:34,160
I think ah well whatever they're ignorant they're just putting their own baggage onto me

422
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:40,960
their own fucking baggage like you're doing my very existence just family so fucking important

423
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:47,040
because the Bible this the Bible that you're acting on all that shit I am acting on normal human

424
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:55,840
conversation and not on rants and and foul language from a group of people who feel marginalized

425
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:01,840
who feel that they've been put into a cage which is absolutely not true the world is open to you

426
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,880
everything that I have to offer is open to you as there is to anyone else that I'm working with

427
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:14,960
you're afraid afraid of what afraid of my sexuality I think not my friend I think not

428
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:22,000
I'm not afraid of my sexuality I don't feel a need to share it all the time like you do

429
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,000
just don't feel that need you want to do that fine I don't give a shit that's fine

430
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,280
but don't be surprised if your audience is not what you want it to be because of that

431
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:41,280
because you're talking to yourself you're talking to your own community which I think is a very

432
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:50,080
poor representation of the gay bisexual, trisexual, transgendered community a very poor representation

433
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,560
you're afraid that we're going to take over the world because we have a fucking talent

434
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,000
oh yeah oh yeah I'm afraid you're going to take over the world that's why

435
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:04,480
so what am I doing I've done nothing but try and help you take over the world I want you

436
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,840
you Richard Bluestein to take over the world with that talent that you think is so fucking great

437
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,040
but if you keep getting stuck in this stupid bullshit you'll never get anywhere

438
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:23,360
and you're marginalizing yourself no no more insults and q potters q wear gay lesbian podcast

439
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:27,840
we got to stick up for yourself and thanks for missus local for sticking up for yourself

440
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:33,280
and for emailing out of curry who responded to the xm think the comments are repeated again

441
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,920
was that the xm somebody I don't remember this the site that's at the promo said

442
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:45,840
xm's a bunch of facts no you didn't listen to it okay you didn't listen to it

443
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,840
and it's still is very different if if the promo would said the q potter or a bunch of

444
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:59,440
facts it never would have made it on the air never you know and

445
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:08,080
and this is like a road out of curry a long email one paragraph not a long email one

446
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:13,760
paragraph basically why this isn't right the fact that it does cause you know people to kill

447
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:23,200
themselves this kind of hate speech and your kind of hate speech doesn't right I'll tell you

448
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:34,480
if I was gay and I'm definitely somewhat gay not but not not even 50% but as I said

449
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,520
I've explored all the limits of my sexuality I know where I stand I'm very comfortable with where

450
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:45,920
I stand not afraid to talk about it but if I was gay and I'm thinking wow that's the community

451
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,880
I got to grow up in without asshole I'd shut up about it you better believe it if you're not gay

452
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:59,040
oh oh I'm sorry I'm sorry now I'll sudden you know all about me you know what I've been through

453
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:04,560
you know my life you know what I've had to go through is a kid you know what what trials and tribulations

454
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:09,440
I had to go through all of a sudden you're fucking special no way mother fucker you're not special

455
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,200
you know more special than a black kid growing up in the projects you know special

456
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:21,680
then growing up in Israel and having bombs thrown at you from the Palestinians or

457
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,120
growing up in Palestine and having the Israelis shoot you from the sky you know more fucking

458
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:31,920
special than that mother fucker in fact I think you're a lot less special because you're not at any

459
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:37,120
physical harm or danger right now you didn't drop homeless you out of your mind

460
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:43,200
get some perspective and you can't fucking imagine what it's like to grow up as a gay or lesbian

461
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:48,080
like an outcast like your life doesn't even make fucking sense oh and that's all that's the same all

462
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:53,280
over the world right that's the same everywhere Richard you you were an Amsterdam for a couple

463
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,920
years you know it's not true you know where I grew up you know that that's very different in other

464
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:03,200
parts of the world some parts are worse some parts are better some parts are hmm kind of uh

465
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:08,000
that's the way it goes but don't tell me what I know and don't know you don't fucking know me you don't

466
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,480
know what I've had to deal with you've no fucking clue particularly when it comes to my sexuality you

467
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:22,640
don't know so don't judge me and I don't judge you never have never will to think you're

468
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:28,640
except on your no talent the fucking only person in the world who doesn't like whatever sexer

469
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,560
supposed to like it doesn't like the sports you're supposed to like I feel like a fucking free

470
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:37,200
and then I have to deal with this bullshit when you grow up except fucking testosterone and

471
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,880
this really like radio which is more to go for it to pop gas to camp oh okay so now we're going to

472
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:49,360
marginalize radio by saying it's 10 testosterone induced switch on the bit fucking radio

473
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:54,880
Richard's turn it on listen scan around the dial that's not true it's absolutely not true

474
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:03,600
god my handle there are a few isn't satisfied with their own sexuality so they have to

475
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:09,760
there you go there you go again presuming that because people aren't satisfied with their own sexuality

476
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:16,320
meaning that boy I guess we haven't explored I guess we're really dissatisfied because

477
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:21,680
well gee you know what sexuality has nothing to do with it this is a beer's a wake-up call

478
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:26,640
folks wake-up call from Madge Weinstein wake-up call for the cute potters and Richard Bluestein okay

479
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:37,840
sexuality has nothing to do with being gay okay if you like anal sex if you like oral sex from

480
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:46,000
the same partner as a man if you like having sex with women it has nothing to do

481
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:55,200
with homosexuality if you're attracted if you are physically a not sex if you are physically

482
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:00,480
attracted and can fall in love and I think you know what that means no I'm sure you know what that

483
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:07,680
means if you can fall in love with someone of the same sex that is homosexuality not just the act

484
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:16,800
or the so-called act of homosexuality it's not in fact on eat this hot show I was very open

485
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:24,400
very honest and no one picked up on it within your so-called marginalized caged community I said

486
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:31,920
you know yeah I kind of like being a bottom I like the idea of penis but I don't like the

487
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:38,720
idea of being attached to a man I was open about that what do I get I get laughed at

488
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:45,120
laughed at by you pod father goes pod bottom and then when I said that Reagan Fox immediately went

489
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:50,800
into all kinds of gory details about oh well this Patricia put vibrator in your ass and I was honest

490
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:55,040
I answered all your questions honestly and you know what you didn't make me feel very welcome at all

491
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:00,240
go back and listen to the show fucker there's to marginalized make themselves feel better

492
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,800
temporarily or at least think they do to be wild you know that really the more I think about the more

493
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:13,840
angry I get about that I was so open I was so honest and you laughed at me and you you did not

494
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:20,960
at all welcome me into your community in that particular show go back and listen to eat this hot show

00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:28,320
where I was on listen to what I said and I was ridiculed ridiculed for saying honest things

496
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:33,840
about my personal sexual behavior which has nothing to do with my feelings towards the opposite

497
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:39,760
sex if I could fall in love with a man which I can't because I just don't have it in me that's not

498
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:48,320
me that's you that's fine I don't give a crap but you sir you are the one that is marginalizing

499
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:55,200
and not being fair and actually putting me down I realize you can't take any of it fucking with you

500
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:02,880
fuck this I am so fucking pissed off you know and you know Adam curry likes to take it and

501
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:07,280
you'll take anything that will save him from having to write you know to actually have to

502
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:12,480
talk during his show okay so now we're gonna go and slam my show right that's what you want to do now

503
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:18,800
can't can't win can't lose can't win either way if I don't play the promos then I'm then I hate the

504
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:23,280
queue potters I hate the queers I hate the gaze hate the faggots because I don't play the

505
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,000
promos but I shouldn't play promos I should be talking make up your mind sorry you got to listen to it

506
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,480
why don't you talk it's more interesting it's fucking promos anyway Jesus Christ

507
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,560
except when it's one of yours right which is so important to you that's when they're good right

508
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:42,400
I shouldn't be talking when you send me an audio comment and you play this fucking promos

509
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:49,040
from that psych psychopathic comics what right do you have to call anyone a psychopath what right do

510
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:56,000
you have what right do you have you have no right to call someone a psychopath or a stalker you

511
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,480
have no right whatsoever to do that certainly not in the position you're in the position that you've

512
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:06,800
taken good stalker who is not funny who is not you know clever like writer small

513
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:11,680
maybe it's not intended to be funny maybe and I have to say if you would listen

514
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,520
and if you would participate in the conversation comic strip blogger is actually quite intelligent

515
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:24,640
quite successful in business has his own podcast is a very talented artist and has some very

516
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:29,200
interesting things to say about what's happening right now in the European Union and he does it

517
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:36,640
in a very similar fashion to what you do using explodives pissing people off sound familiar

518
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:42,960
I think you just jealous who's just basically a psychotic person who was used as a child and

519
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:49,440
as acting out on his weird end right so if your gay is a child then it's not okay to call someone

520
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:54,800
gay or fag or whatever but if someone was abused as a child it's okay to laugh at them and to

521
00:58:54,800 --> 00:59:02,720
ridicule them is that what you're saying as I just said he's accomplished plenty on his own

522
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:07,600
that's clever now you have to draw the line on content maybe you need somebody to produce

523
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,840
or show for you now I think you need somebody to produce your show for you because that'll

524
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:17,440
get you back to the Mad wine scene that I started working with in January of 2005 that I fell in

525
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:22,880
love with someone needs to put your head back on straight stop trying to be Howard Stern stop trying

526
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:31,440
to be things you're not and stop please stop trying to make me feel that you're that I'm putting

527
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:38,880
you in a box and marginalizing you stop that because some of this shit just doesn't belong in it

528
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:46,960
you're saying to piss off the people who you know are you're part of yourself part of your

529
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,280
no you're starting to piss me off that's what's going on here

530
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:57,360
you know I'm not gonna hide what I think so because I know you're not gonna hide what you think

531
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:02,560
that was the agreement we made you liar and I think it's clear how pissed I am the fact that

532
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:07,280
this isn't even a comment I'm barely so scared this is going on my show only right I can expect

533
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:12,640
myself express myself the way I want to so I'm sure that Adam Perry and his show today it's

534
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:18,480
blamed how he didn't listen to his show and he should any apologizes but oh fuck that no okay so

535
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:23,360
that's where you're wrong all right I'm sorry I didn't rush ahead and listen to your show

536
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:27,360
and that I didn't get all my email to find out about it so I could have done it yesterday sorry

537
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:35,600
it took me a day later sorry about that oh shit you know this shit's all over the place it's

538
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:40,400
not even just everywhere yeah Keith and the girl it's perfectly fine to say fact but nobody

539
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,320
it's perfectly fine to say fact except when you don't think it's fine to say fact is that it

540
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:48,320
they're saying nigger because they're afraid they're gonna beat up but who's gonna you know

541
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:53,760
but assisting nobody's gonna hurt you if you're assisting well let me tell you

542
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:59,600
let me tell you so what you've done that you just you just completely

543
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:06,320
marginalized yourself what you just said is that people are afraid to say nigger

544
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:11,280
because they think some big black guy is gonna show up your front door and knife you to death

545
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:17,920
yet the same time people aren't afraid to say faggot because they're scissi boys

546
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:28,320
dude I watch porn there's a lot there's a lot of gay men out there who could fuck me up really bad

547
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:34,160
who could kill me with and snap my neck like a twig that's bullshit stupid argument next

548
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:42,000
yeah I guess again all right so that's it very very disappointing

549
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:49,440
very disappointing all right I'm done with this I've nothing left to say I've done about it what shit

550
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:58,560
I've done over an hour of this and I think I've made my point very clear if you want to have a civil

551
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:03,840
conversation if you want to tell me what the ground rules are for you would make you feel

552
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,960
comfortable and uncomfortable we can do that because it seems that other people who contribute to the

553
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:16,960
daily source code to my show can do that in a civil manner unlike you which really I did not expect at all

554
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:45,760
when I first met you thought you were pretty cool so when I liked to hang around

555
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:52,640
so I introduced you to all my friends pretty soon I was no doubt you were ahead of it with everyone

556
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:58,800
several on the scene then I started to get some subtle signs and didn't know exactly what they're

557
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:13,440
like the people that you'll know before corroborate your stories and the details of your shady

558
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:19,680
past and seems so gory and the things you said you're done and the places you have bad

559
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:28,480
I didn't meet up from Berlin without the stairs between you had a stink at you I saw a crack of a

560
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:37,280
little like someone on the case get out of my face I get out of my way stop hanging around my

561
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:45,680

562
01:03:45,680 --> 01:04:00,400
the fun will wait here I'm not a place and another town I guess you're pretty lucky

563
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:07,120
that I'm no one I was found out but eventually they all will see a decision I'm no doubt

564
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:12,400
because when you build out house I can't I'll tell you what you'll get if your strong wind's gone

I'll come along you'll get the end of the day you better think about this get not you I'll

01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:52,960
I'm still after them just get out of my way stop hanging around I'm still after them just get out of my way

575
01:06:52,960 --> 01:07:06,960
I don't need you around I'm still after them just get out of my way stop hanging around

576
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:38,960
I don't need you around

577
01:07:38,960 --> 01:08:06,960
I don't need you around

578
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:26,960
I'm still after them just get out of my way stop hanging around

579
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:52,960
I'm still after them just get out of my way stop hanging around

580
01:08:52,960 --> 01:09:16,960
I told you not to bring anything this morning and you're worried about that

581
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:32,960
I can't imagine because I could hear your answers and your reactions

582
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:50,960
I hate that I hate lying and I am a homophobic because I play this promo just made me so angry

583
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:58,960
I can do anything but you know the things that you boss is asking so that's not true

584
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:10,960
because you are the real boss I am the boss the homo thing now being married to me is almost being married to homo because of the homo

585
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,960
I don't want to get angry with you

586
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:20,960
I don't want to get angry with you

587
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:30,960
I don't want to get angry with you

588
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:48,960
I don't want to get angry with you

589
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:58,960
I don't want to get angry with you

590
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:16,960
I don't want to get angry with you

591
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:24,960
sometimes she had to defend herself because she was so nice about explaining the friend in our house

592
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:32,960
my mom's friend now he lives with a guy and they stay in our house

593
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:42,960
and she has a little girl she thought that was just the most normal thing

594
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:48,960
so it's so funny to hear this whole thing and it's stupid thing going on

595
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,960
for anyone to say that I am not comfortable with my sexuality

596
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,960
thank you

597
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,960
I think you said enough for that exactly what I'd be married to you

598
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,960
that is very funny

599
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,960
but really made me laughable

600
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,960
but it's stupid

601
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,960
it's just stupid I think that match just wants a lot of attention

602
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:18,960
I think so too and I'm still not sure if this was done to get controversy going to be talked about

603
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,960
he talked so much about Howard Stern and this as well

604
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,960
Howard Stern

605
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,960
I think we're exactly the same he doesn't give a shit

606
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:32,960
he's fine but he says Fag instead of gay instead of queer instead of queen

607
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,960
which one I just just give me the list please just give me the list

608
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,960
what word can I use if I actually am talking about homosexuals

609
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:44,960
not about a competitor to serious satellite radio

610
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,960
it's stupid

611
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,960
I'm coming from somebody who's dressed up and doesn't know who he is

612
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,960
thank you

613
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,960
all right we're that will leave it big thank you

614
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,960
it felt really good though to give it off my chest

615
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:00,960
yeah I heard you

616
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,960
downstairs

617
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,960
you cross the street

618
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,960
and by the way I was going to say

619
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,960
when those are open you know

620
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,960
it's so unfortunate that little Britain

621
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,960
isn't on in the United States

622
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,960
if people were to see that show

623
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:18,960
and how the United Kingdom how Britain

624
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,960
is so open

625
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:24,960
but not just that

626
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,960
but it's just funny

627
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,960
it's funny it's like laughing in yourself

628
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,960
and then yeah all that that's great Britain

629
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,960
or the Brits are very good at that

630
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,960
laughing at themselves

631
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,960
yes very good at it and then you have

632
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,960
always been hello it's Linda

633
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,960
so this is one scene between the university

634
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,960
and there's this woman which is of course actually played by a guy

635
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,960
and her name is Linda

636
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,960
and so students come in and request things like

637
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:52,960
you know I need my courses changed or I need my

638
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,960
I need to take the test over

639
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,960
and then she'll always have to call someone

640
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,960
to say you know I have this person here

641
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,960
here's the request they have and so

642
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,960
and it's a comedian who actually is a man

643
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,960
and he's a woman

644
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:08,960
what match really could be if she were funny

645
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,960
so it's Linda and then so incomes

646
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,960
you know this really boochy looking girl

647
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:16,960
and then so yeah I have to change my coursework

648
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,960
and so oh one moment I'll call you and she'll call and say

649
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,960
hello it's Linda yes

650
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,960
I have here I have Carol here

651
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,960
yes the butchee one yes you know the big fat

652
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,960
diek you know and so just keep on doing

653
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,960
and it's like hey let's Linda

654
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,960
yes you know I wasn't

655
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:34,960
but Lumpa here

656
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,960
yeah there's like a midget and call it Lumpa Lumpa Lumpa

657
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,960
the Chinese guy yes the Qingchan China man

658
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,960
and it's just funny you know get

659
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,960
over your fucking silly

660
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,960
and that wasn't okay

661
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,960
maybe only in America

662
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,960
maybe that's it

663
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,960
the country by the way and we did look

664
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,960
didn't we move because of the old

665
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,960
that was definitely one of the reasons

666
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,960
not actually because you are an American

667
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,960
and you're very proud of it

668
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:02,960
but I was very annoyed with certain things

669
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,960
you know that was a pity

670
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,960
we actually decided to move

671
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,960
when uh what's your name

672
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,960
Lidles mom

673
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,960
uh um

674
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,960
I forgot actually

675
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,960
Ronnie and

676
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,960
Ida Ida Ida

677
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,960
Ida came to our back door

678
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,960
and she said

679
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,960
Patricia

680
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,960
I'm the one that has to tell you

681
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,960
we had a conversation all the moms at school

682
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,960
we have a complaint

683
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,960
you have to wear a less tight clothes

684
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,960
when you come to pick up Christina

685
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,960
because all the boys are looking

686
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,960
yeah I know you're showing

687
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,960
of your figure too much

688
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,960
yeah meanwhile they

689
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,960
do not have the same figure that you have

690
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,960
so it's like projecting there

691
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,960
their own frustrations

692
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,960
if I could wear a beggy t-shirt

693
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,960
so you don't see my figure

694
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,960
you're showing off too much excuse me

695
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,960
yeah she's showing off

696
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,960
I have to go to school to show off

697
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,960
so

698
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,960
and that was actually the last thing

699
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,960
and then there was the magazine

700
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,960
that we had in a house

701
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,960
you know like playboy

702
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,960
oh big problem

703
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,960
I used to take showers with Christina

704
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,960
yeah I'd actually hold her in my arms

705
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:16,960
and when she was little

706
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,960
and up until she was probably about

707
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,960
five maybe or it was a chair bath

708
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,960
you're going to bed

709
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,960
we actually you and I decided

710
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,960
you have conversation still in the bathroom

711
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,960
while you were taking shower

712
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,960
morning when my daughter was in there

713
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,960
yeah I hear you too have a conversation

714
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,960
she doesn't even see it

715
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,960
but we actually actually

716
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,960
I stopped doing that

717
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,960
because we were afraid that she might mention that

718
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,960
and we could actually get into real trouble

719
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,960
later yeah but now it's another problem

720
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,960
no well you're not going in the bath

721
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,960
in the bathtub

722
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,960
but you're taking a shower

723
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,960
sometimes I have to say hello

724
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,960
do you know your naked

725
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,960

728
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:06,960
and we all die naked

729
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,960
no don't die naked

730
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,960

734
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,960
