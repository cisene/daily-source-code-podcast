00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:53,160

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:53,160
She's got a kid in her eye, because her name would imply.

19
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,160
Things are only designed.

28
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:45,160
You know people hate this, you always hate people talking about the sound of the show, I'm not going to say anything, but yes, I have a shitty sound

29
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:53,160
No, you don't have a shitty sound, we just have to get you another pet, we have to get another pair of those headphones, after I bought these wonderful Sony's

30
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,160
Yeah, that's where mine, I know there were yours, but this is so good

31
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Let's see

32
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
Hey baby, how are you doing?

33
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
Yeah, good

34
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,160
Did you get some messages from people asking you to come on the show?

35
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,160
Oh, yeah, oh, geez, really?

36
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
I wonder why

37
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
Did they didn't come from you?

38
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,160
No, they didn't come from me, what did they say?

39
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,160
Well, that they like it when I'm here and

40
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,160
And where the hell are you, is what they said, right?

41
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:29,160
It adds something to the show, you know, and that, you know, it's sort of an

42
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,160
Adam is more

43
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,160
Fuller, more

44
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
Fuller?

45
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Yeah, complete

46
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,160
I'm more complete when you're on the show

47
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,160
You're more complete when I'm on the show, I don't know what they mean, but

48
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
No, I understand that

49
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,160
Yeah, that makes sense

50
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Your hair is very pretty by the way

51
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
Oh, thank you

52
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,160
Yeah, I told you when I came home

53
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,160
But you haven't been on why you've been on the show once, kind of, quick, one point

54
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,160
Oh, that's what you mean, with a little bit of gold blonde

55
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
Yeah, but it's also, it's a different style

56
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,160
I thought I'll, you know, add a little bit of sunshine in it

57
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,160
Yeah, I thought I'd just suck up to you at the beginning of the show

58
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
So you don't go too hard on me

59
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,160
Go, you don't need to, you know, man

60
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
So, what's going on?

61
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
We got you Vaughn coming

62
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Your sister is coming

63
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,160
Yeah, and I like to contact Beaumacartney

64
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,160
For your sister?

65
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
For your sister?

66
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,160
We need a good woman

67
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
Uh-huh

68
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
It is a nice man

69
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,160
I have a nice woman

70
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Hold on a second, let's just back up

71
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,160
So your sister who has been single for how many years?

72
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,160
A long time

73
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,160
Yeah, long time

74
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,160
And, you know, she had some friends here

75
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,160
Like, what's a long time?

76
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,160
Let's just define a long time

77
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
Twenty years?

78
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
Yeah

79
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
Twenty years

80
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
Oh, my goodness

81
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
She's had a couple of boyfriends

82
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,160
Most of them capital L losers

83
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,160
Well, her biggest love was Steve Harley

84
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,160
You know, she, she lived with him for nine years

85
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
For nine years

86
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
From Cockney Rebel

87
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,160
And, uh, he started to drink

88
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
Uh-huh

89
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
Hugs and everything

90
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,160
Then he didn't know what he was doing

91
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,160
And then what happened?

92
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,160
He sent her home to Holland

93
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Oh, no

94
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
And she went, she loved

95
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Biggest mistake

96
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
And he said that later to her

97
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
But then he was too late, of course

98
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
She moved on

99
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
Right

100
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
But there still were

101
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,160
There's still in contact with each other

102
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,160
And I think that that was her real love

103
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
And he's remarried now, isn't he?

104
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
He married later on

105
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
He married a stewardess and he has

106
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Good for him

107
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
Yep

108
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
And well, no, no

109
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
They're gone a lot in their heart

110
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,160
Yeah, so easy

111
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
You know, I'll find a stewardess

112
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Well, excuse me

113
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
Don't I was clevering

114
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
First of all, it's a

115
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,160
Uh, it's not a stewardess

116
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,160
No, I'm not anymore

117
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,160
A flight attendant

118
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,160
A flight attendant

119
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,160
And don't put them down, dude

120
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,160
No, no, this is not what I'm saying

121
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,160
Not the flight attendant

122
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,160
Yeah, I'm from the aviation industry

123
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
I know

124
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
We defend our own hearing

125
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,160
Or did I say something wrong?

126
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
No, I mean like

127
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
Typical

128
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,160
I was traveling

129
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
I was very busy

130
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,160
And there was a nice woman in the sky

131
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
That's not an all typical

132
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,160
Like two people in show business

133
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,160
Hoking up at some television shows

134
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
Well, somebody's doing it mean to you

135
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
Yeah, I mean, that's not an all typical

136
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
You can't believe it

137
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,160
You can't believe it

138
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,160
You know, okay, but I still think that

139
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,160
They were meant for each other

140
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,160
Okay, so anyway, so that's not going to happen

141
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,160
So

142
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,160
Now you're trying to find Paul McCartney for her?

143
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
Yes, yes

144
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,160
She's a wonderful old-fashioned

145
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Very good-looking woman

146
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,160
And you don't find them like that at all

147
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,160
The Paul is looking for someone with a hook

148
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,160
You know, so we had Linda

149
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
With a hook on a hook

150
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
No, no, no, no, no, no

151
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
I'm not on a hook

152
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,160
I like captain hook

153
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,160
Madam captain hook

154
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
Paul, come here

155
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,160
No, Linda was a vegetarian

156
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,160
Yeah

157
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
Big Veggie

158
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
Veggie person

159
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
Yeah

160
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,160
And Heather, of course, had a wooden line

161
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
Oh, don't lie

162
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,160
I'm not laughing

163
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
Yeah, I'm laughing

164
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,160
Yeah, I'm laughing

165
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,160
But it's not, you know what I mean?

166
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,160
Yeah, it's just a joke

167
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,160
But anyway, so can you sister have some kind of deformity

168
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Or something that will make it

169
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
I think he's into that

170
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,160
No, he's interested in things

171
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah

172
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,160
There is something about people

173
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,160
With definite, look at Pete

174
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,160
Who's in the big brother house right now

175
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,160
Well, actually Steve Hardy had something

176
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,160
Yeah, it wouldn't lag

177
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
So

178
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,160
They're probably the same then

179
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
He had a deformity

180
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,160
Respected him and never talked about it

181
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
Of course, because it doesn't make any difference

182
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,160
But you see with people like Pete and the big brother house

183
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,160
Who has to read

184
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
He's going to win this thing

185
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
He's going to win because people like that

186
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
Once they can look at this

187
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,160
It adds something

188
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,160
It does

189
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,160
That's a lot of movement to your life

190
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Yeah, yeah

191
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,160
But you know, he should have because he's a nice guy

192
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,160
I believe that

193
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,160
He was like him as he was the nicest beetle

194
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,160
And yeah, he was the nicest

195
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,160
And so I think he needs an old fashioned woman

196
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,160
It can cook for him

197
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
He likes that

198
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,160
He's not somebody who wants to go out

199
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Do anything

200
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
Just wants to do a nice thing

201
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,160
Exactly my sister

202
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,160
But I think don't you think he is

203
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
Who is this?

204
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
She

205
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,160
Don't you think Paul needs a little

206
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
A little rest now

207
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,160
Yeah, he needs some rest

208
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,160
He shouldn't want to read my sister

209
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,160
Yeah

210
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,160
There you go

211
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
I'll be sure

212
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
You know what?

213
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
Is he going to come on the show?

214
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
I will

215
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
Ask her

216
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
I'll be sure

217
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
We have some plans of course

218
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
Oh, really?

219
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
Yep

220
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,160
What are your

221
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,160
Please

222
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,160
Tell me your mind

223
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,160
She's been very busy

224
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,160
She has a she owns a shop in Holland

225
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
So she's been standing on her feet a lot

226
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,160
And she's tired

227
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,160
So I said when you arrive

228
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
I've got flowers later

229
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,160
I have an appointment for you

230
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
Oh, nice

231
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
So we start off with a nice pedicure

232
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
And then

233
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
With the Korean muffin

234
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,160
Or then a Korean

235
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,160
Yeah, yeah

236
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
Hello

237
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,160
Oh, maybe

238
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
Swivel

239
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Swivel

240
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
Swivel

241
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,160
Swivel

242
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
She's on my bars full swivel chair

243
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
And of course, her feet don't reach the ground

244
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
It's just literally swiveling

245
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,160
180 degrees away from me

246
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
One more

247
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,160
She's fine

248
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,160
As long as I can go

249
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
Should I get the booster seat for you, man?

250
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,160
Should we get a little booster seat for Patricia?

251
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
Sit in the studio

252
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
So

253
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
You have just everything is high here

254
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
For you

255
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,160
For your size

256
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
Yes, man

257
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
So what I was like

258
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,160
And then we want to go a day

259
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,160
So you move the microphone up

260
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,160
But now whenever you're talking

261
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
Looking down

262
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,160
I'm going to go to London with her

263
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
Yeah

264
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
Oh, really?

265
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,160
What day is that?

266
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,160
I don't know yet

267
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,160
Because I've got to be in London a couple times

268
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,160
Next week

269
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
Oh, we have to go and see a museum

270
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
Uh-huh

271
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,160
The British Museum

272
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,160
I want to see the dresses

273
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,160
To go into the tower

274
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
Yeah

275
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,160
The British Museum

276
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
Yeah

277
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,160
Cool

278
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Yeah

279
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,160
So, you know

280
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,160
That's it?

281
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
No, no

282
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
And shopping

283
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
And high street shopping

284
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,160
A little bit

285
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,160
A little bit

286
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,160
She has a shop

287
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,160
So she doesn't need to shop

288
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
Yeah, that's true

289
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,160
That's true

290
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
That's true

291
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,160
Okay

292
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,160
You aren't aware

293
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,160
Because you don't listen to the show

294
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,160
But I gave away an iPod in a contest

295
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Really?

296
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,160
Yeah, it's a guy had a

297
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
He registered a domain name

298
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
And had a website

299
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,160
Troy needs an iPod.com

300
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,160
He was asking people for donations

301
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,160
And I said, you know, that's kind of cool

302
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,160
Because then someone else came in with

303
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,160
I need an iPod more than Troy.com

304
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,160
And I said, come up with the craziest

305
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,160
With the craziest domain name

306
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
You can think of

307
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
And the winner

308
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
Is very interesting person

309
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
You must listen to what he has to say

310
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,160
Hi Adam, this is Marty Abernathy

311
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,160
I am a 38-year-old

312
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,160
Transsexual scruncher

313
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
From Indianapolis

314
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
I'm a designer of crappy websites

315
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,160
You know, the thing there is

316
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
I don't care about someone being transsexual

317
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
What do you do?

318
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,160
I am a Paul Dior Scruncher

319
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
This is horrible

320
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
Yeah

321
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
Okay

322
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
And shitty URLs

323
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,160
Yes, that's right

324
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,160
I want an iPod on the daily source code

325
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,160
And why did I win this iPod

326
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,160
For my great humanitarian deed?

327
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,160
No

328
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
I won it for talking about

329
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
PILL

330
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,160
My mother is going to be so proud

331
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,160
Don't worry, my mom would be very proud too

332
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,160
I'm sure this will go in our scrapbook

333
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,160
Oh and Adam

334
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,160
I didn't register my URL at

335
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
GoDaddy.com

336
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,160
That was the whole point

337
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,160
It was like I was tying it into GoDaddy

338
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,160
Sanco Register, your domain name at GoDaddy

339
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
Yeah, yeah

340
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
The daily source DSC3 code

341
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,160
And get it for $6.95

342
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,160
So it just shows that

343
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,160
You know, contests are

344
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,160
Yeah, they're working

345
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,160
Yeah, only she didn't register

346
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
GoDaddy.com

347
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,160
I registered it

348
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,160
Directknick.com

349
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,160
I have an affinity for them

350
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,160
Because they kept me regular

351
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
During a flood

352
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,160
And a hurricane

353
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,160
That's loyalty

354
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
I want to pimp them

355
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,160
And help them out as much as I can

356
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,160
And finally I wanted to pimp my podcast

357
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,160
Because I mean, that's what I'm here for, right?

358
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,160
Check out the second thought to podcast

359
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,160
Or we discuss the differences in social interaction

360
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,160
In second life and in real life

361
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,160
Think of it as second life sociology 101

362
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,160
Okay

363
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,160
And yes, you upfront

364
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,160
This will be on the test

365
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,160
My other podcast is the fat-trany circus

366
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,160
I named it that because I'm fat

367
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,160
The fat-trany circus

368
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,160
Oh

369
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,160
I'm a tranny

370
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,160
And I've been called a clown in many of the forums across the internet

371
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,160
So check out STpodcast.com

372
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,160
For second thoughts

373
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,160
And the FTC podcast.com

374
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,160
For the fat-trany circus

375
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,160
PS

376
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,160
Podfather, I need you to forgive me

377
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
Uh-oh

378
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
Podfather, I've sinned against you

379
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,160
Uh-oh

380
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
Every time

381
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,160
The lady Patricia comes on

382
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,160
I think of one thing and one thing only

383
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
Bang and us both at the same time

384
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,160
No, it's not sex

385
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
Even though she is really hot

386
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
That's not what I think about

387
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,160
That's right, Podfather

388
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,160
I think of green acres and A4

389
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,160
A4

390
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
Do you remember green acres?

391
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
Yeah, cool

392
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Can I look at the Albert?

393
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
No, and I look like Eddie Albert

394
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
Anyways, gotta go, Podfather

395
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,160
Let's go

396
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,160
Green acres is the green

397
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,160
You do have a little bit of A4

398
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,160
A4, but it's not bad

399
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
No, no, no, no

400
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,160
No, just listen to me

401
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,160
No, A4 was the good one

402
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
She was the good one

403
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,160
She was the good one

404
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,160
Not the judge, I think you got it

405
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
I'm not a judge, I think you got it

406
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,160
You're the only object that I'd rather pass

407
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
Yeah

408
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,160
Yeah, yeah, the way it's about anything

409
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,160
You know, you're kind of like the

410
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,160
The New York socialite type, I guess?

411
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,160
Yeah, in country, in country life

412
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,160
Yeah, was the phone ringing?

413
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,160
I think the phone was ringing

414
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,160
I hope

415
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,160
Do you think the next door neighbor?

416
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,160
Do you think she got it?

417
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,160
The teenager is picking it up

418
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,160
I'll show her

419
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
She is quite a teenager

420
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,160
Now, did you tell your listeners about

421
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,160
Uh-huh

422
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
You know, that we wanted to have

423
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,160
And you organize a nice party for

424
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
I told them that I was going to

425
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
Arlis, you can say Arlisner's baby

426
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
Arlisner, not just Mark

427
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,160
Yeah, I told them that we were going to that place

428
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
Yeah

429
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,160
And how hard it was I could

430
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,160
So many pubs and places

431
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,160
Well, they don't want teenagers

432
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
They don't want teenagers

433
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
They don't want teenagers

434
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
Isn't it said?

435
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
That's said

436
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,160
Well, it's said because on MTV here

437
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
The same show that runs in America

438
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,160
Uh, my, what is it?

439
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,160
Super sweet 16

440
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,160
Yeah, that's what she's watching

441
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,160
Yeah

442
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
And she thinks, you know, I want to have a nice party

443
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
And so she's like, where can I find a pub

444
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
That has a door big enough for my dad to drive

445
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
With a big bowl on it

446
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,160
She's too young

447
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
She doesn't even want that

448
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
She didn't even mention it

449
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
She hasn't asked for it

450
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
And she never asked for anything

451
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Which is kind of cool

452
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,160
But she thought it was cool to have a nice party

453
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,160
And she wanted an Alice in Wonderland party

454
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
Right

455
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
That's the theme

456
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
Okay, so it was very hard

457
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
Because all the people I talked to

458
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,160
She said, no, you don't want any teenagers

459
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,160
Yes, problems

460
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
Yeah, because when you're 16

461
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,160
You can drink right?

462
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
True

463
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
Because here in England

464
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,160
And Christina wasn't thinking about that

465
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
She's not a drink herself

466
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
Teenage is drink

467
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Yeah

468
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
And then it starts

469
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,160
You know, they start to hit each other

470
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,160
And it's violent

471
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,160
And it's puking

472
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,160
And it's sex

473
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,160
And that's sad

474
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
You know, you know, my theory right

475
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,160
Where you can feel the frustration of a country

476
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,160
Or a community

477
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,160
By looking at what's happening in traffic

478
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Yeah

479
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,160
That's the gas station

480
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,160
And it was really busy

481
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,160
And I actually had to pull up into the

482
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,160
The pump for left hand gas tank

483
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
So even though mine is on the right

484
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
Yeah

485
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
You pull it over the trunk

486
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
You pull it over the trunk

487
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,160
And stick it in kind of upside down

488
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
And it was like two guys

489
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
A grown-up guys

490
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
You know, like my age

491
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
Yeah

492
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
Real men

493
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,160
And someone, you know

494
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,160
So everyone was waiting

495
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,160
And she was inside buying something

496
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
And paying whatever

497
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
And then she got into her car

498
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,160
And she drove

499
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
For whatever reason

500
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
They started yelling at each other

501
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,160
But it was really unbelievable

502
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,160
The things that they were saying

503
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,160
And I was like

504
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
It could tell it was like real anger

505
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
But I moved it especially

506
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
Because I didn't want to hear these things

507
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,160
Yeah, so anyway

508
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,160
Oh, just that that's

509
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,160
I was actually shocked

510
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
I was like

511
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
I was just very disappointed

512
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Yeah, I was really shocked

513
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Like, man, I can't I can't believe it

514
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
You know, just

515
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,160
Oh, for nothing

516
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Yeah, I was like

517
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
Go on a diet, you fat content

518
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
Oh man

519
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,160
Yeah

520
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
And yeah, I was thinking

521
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
Like should I say something to this guy

522
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
Like, you know

523
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
You're such a

524
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
They were like painters

525
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
You know, they had the painter

526
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
Smocks on and the latter on

527
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
And I thought, no, I'm a pussy

528
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
I want to get the crap

529
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
The thing is they're probably

530
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,160
Extremely unhappy

531
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,160
Because otherwise you're not

532
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
You don't do that

533
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,160
There's just no reason to

534
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
But I've seen it myself

535
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,160
You know, when I'm driving to the airport

536
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
The first eight times or whatever

537
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,160
That I drove

538
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
There's a lot of turns, you know

539
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
And you're following the navigator

540
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,160
And so I'd make a wrong turn

541
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
Then I'd go left and whatever

542
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,160
People who would be behind me

543
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,160
Would be frustrated with me

544
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Obviously trying to find the way

545
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
I know

546
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,160
But they would be really like yelling

547
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
Yeah, but like really

548
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
I mean, come on

549
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,160
They do that in New York

550
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,160
In New York, in New York

551
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,160
In New York, it's our language

552
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
This is how we speak

553
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,160
That's how you communicate

554
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
I'm one of those assholes

555
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,160
When you're when you're crossing the street

556
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,160
And don't walk

557
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,160
I am on the horn

558
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
And I'm on the accelerator

559
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
Fuck you

560
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,160
I know you

561
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
Fuck you because not you

562
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,160
But fuck you

563
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
Because you are

564
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
Fucking up the system in New York

565
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
I remember sitting next to you

566
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
When you were driving

567
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
In New York

568
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,160
You were always like

569
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
You want to die

570
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
You want to die

571
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,160
Mother fucker

572
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
Go ahead

573
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,160
Yeah, right

574
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,160
But that's how we do it in New York

575
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,160
That's just nice

576
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,160
That's nice

577
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,160
That's identify yourself as a New Yorker

578
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,160
I am a New Yorker

579
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,160
Fuck you very much

580
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,160
Get the fuck out of my way

581
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
The first thing I learned

582
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
When I came to live there

583
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
It was fuck off

584
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,160
No, it was

585
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,160
You have to put on a sort of don't fuck with me face

586
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,160
And I didn't know that in the beginning

587
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,160
So they fucked with me constantly

588
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Then I think you got the don't fuck with me face

589
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,160
Don't you dare fuck with me face

590
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,160
Yeah

591
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,160
You need that

592
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,160
That's what gives you respect on the streets

593
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
Nobody ever did anything

594
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,160
Was said anything would touch me

595
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
Or that's what it is

596
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,160
Is it sort of attitude

597
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,160
But it's disappointing

598
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,160
But they can't see my face

599
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,160
I'm in the car

600
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
So that's why you have to be a little more vocal about it

601
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,160
But I'm glad I'm in an English car

602
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,160
I mean that's a different

603
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,160
Oh, that doesn't make a difference

604
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,160
Otherwise you're that fucking foreigner

605
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,160
No, because I know just when I had a different

606
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
Oh, they were very courteous

607
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,160
Yes, true

608
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,160
They thought, oh, poor woman

609
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,160
She does, oh, she's Dutch

610
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,160
Yeah, but that's because you got to it

611
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
And nice ones

612
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,160
Oh, my dad

613
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
Yeah, no, I'm the

614
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,160
I'm the

615
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,160
I don't get that treatment from the guys

616
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
No, they don't see my friends

617
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,160
That's a big-haired faggot

618
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
It's on

619
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
It's on

620
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,160
Believe me

621
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,160
You in that jag

622
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,160
Exactly

623
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
Glossy lips

624
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,160
They're just like, god damn

625
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,160
Damn

626
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,160
It's follow that bitch

627
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
No

628
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,160
Comics were bloggers sent in a comment for you

629
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
Oh, yeah

630
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
Hey, Patricia

631
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,160
It's a toy boy

632
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,160
Adam Kerry playing Prince Charming

633
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Properly still

634
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,160
Well, screw him

635
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,160
My question is to you

636
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,160
Patricia

637
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,160
Bye

638
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,160
I have impression

639
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,160
That you are too vague about your ethnicity

640
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,160
About your origins

641
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Saying that you are half Dutch, half Greek

642
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,160
But that inner reality

643
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,160
You don't fear any association

644
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,160
To neither of them

645
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,160
That you're a cosmopolitan

646
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,160
And others such bullshit

647
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,160
If you're pardon me, my friends

648
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,160
So

649
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,160
Mrs. Rishuoshi

650
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,160
Could you tell me

651
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,160
Would you believe in European Union idea

652
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,160
Particularly because your current right to about in UK

653
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,160
Is based on European Union citizenship

654
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,160
Do you think the Patricia that European Union has long-term future

655
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,160
For example, 100 or 500 years

656
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,160
Or will it fall apart

657
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,160
Soon or sooner

658
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,160
Patricia

659
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,160
Don't be flipping what she was she

660
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,160
Love it

661
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
Or hate it

662
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Speak up babes

663
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,160
Yeah

664
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,160
Two questions there

665
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
Two questions

666
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
Locker

667
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,160
Locker

668
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,160
Conextive vlogger

669
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,160
Lotka

670
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,160
Oh

671
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:41,160
I am too different

672
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,160
I am too different

673
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,160
I love that

674
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,160
Lotka

675
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,160
You got to be old

676
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,160
You have to remember taxi

677
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,160
I am too different

678
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,160
Okay

679
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,160
Play it on and baby

680
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,160
You know

681
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,160
I've been traveling so much

682
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,160
That I'm still looking

683
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,160
For a place that I feel at home

684
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,160
And

685
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,160
So

686
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,160
I was born in Holland

687
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,160
But I always wanted to go somewhere else

688
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,160
And whenever my parents said

689
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,160
Come on, hop in the car

690
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
We're going over the border

691
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,160
I was happy

692
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Really

693
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
Yeah, I always liked it

694
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,160
So I'm sort of sigoina

695
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
Gypsy

696
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,160
Yes

697
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,160
So

698
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,160
You are 100% Dutch, right?

699
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,160
I'm 100% Dutch, yeah

700
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,160
Hold on, hold on, hold that thought baby

701
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,160
Because the satellite window is closing

702
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,160
Yes, wave goodbye

703
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,160
Shake those movies for the serious satellite listeners

704
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,160
You felt a draft

705
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,160
Yeah

706
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
Peed up, close the window

707
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
She feels a draft

708
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,160
Yeah

709
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,160
PCH is next for y'all

710
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
Talk to you tomorrow, bye

711
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,660
Okay

712
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,160
So

713
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,160
Now

714
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,160
Well

715
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,160
Of course, but in the Dutch

716
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,160
I mean Holland is a very small country

717
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
So everybody

718
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,160
Do you feel like Holland is your home

719
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,160
That's

720
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,160
Who knows?

721
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,160
Don't be wishy-washy

722
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,160
No, no

723
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
Have you ever felt like Holland was your home

724
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,160
Okay

725
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,160
You lived in a...

726
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,160
I always wanted to live somewhere else

727
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,160
Miss Pie, during your glamour years

728
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,160
You lived in the United States of America

729
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
In the garden state

730
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,160
Yes, I did

731
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,160
Known as Jersey

732
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,160
I love that

733
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,160
Okay

734
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,160
Did you feel...

735
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,160
That was home for you?

736
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,160
I lived in Germany a long time

737
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,160
When I was...

738
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,160
I think six years old

739
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,160
And...

740
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
Oh, before that

741
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,160
And after that

742
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,160
Did you feel like that was home?

743
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,160
No

744
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,160
Well, I loved the bridge

745
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
How about New Jersey?

746
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,160
No, Jersey felt very much like Holland

747
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,160
Did you...

748
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,160
Maybe you felt more like a Jersey girl than...

749
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,160
Absolutely

750
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,160
Absolutely

751
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,160
Yeah

752
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,160
Yeah, yeah

753
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,160
Yeah, yeah

754
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,160
You're a golden hair flowing

755
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,160
The convertible

756
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
Mm-hmm

757
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,160
That's very Jersey-Gurly

758
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,160
Yeah

759
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,160
The coupé rings

760
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,160
You're kind of a chef

761
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,160
Well, and also being in show business

762
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,160
You always heard

763
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,160
Especially in the time that I was working

764
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,160
That...

765
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,160
Oh, you're from Holland

766
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,160
Oh

767
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
You know?

768
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,160
Oh

769
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,160
Oh

770
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,160
I love that city

771
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,160
I really love your work

772
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,160
You're from Holland

773
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,160
Yeah

774
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,160
It's a pity you're not coming from America

775
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,160
You would be such a big, big star

776
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
Or, you know?

777
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,160
Oh, it's a bit of, you know, come from England

778
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
Or anything

779
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,160
But Holland

780
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
Yeah

781
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,160
Can be right

782
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,160
Yeah

783
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,160
You know, it can be good

784
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,160
That is kind of...

785
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,160
It changed a little bit with chalking blue

786
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,160
And all the things

787
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,160
You know, but still, but still

788
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,160
Golden Earing

789
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,160
But that's it

790
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,160
But that's it

791
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,160
That's it

792
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,160
So how about England?

793
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,160
Well, I always wanted to be British

794
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,160
Don't know why?

795
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,160
Do you want to become a British citizen?

796
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,160
Yeah

797
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,160
What?

798
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
Do you want to become British?

799
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,160
I would love to

800
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,160
Really?

801
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
Yeah, I'm thinking about it

802
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,160
Wow

803
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,160
That's it

804
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,160
But I'm still...

805
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,160
You're still getting the vibe

806
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
Still getting the vibe

807
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,160
So what if you don't...

808
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,160
What if it turns out that this is not the right place

809
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,160
I mean, you're trying to shoot route now

810
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,160
Yeah

811
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,160
You're trying to grab onto a place

812
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,160
Where you can...

813
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,160
Oh, it doesn't work

814
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,160
Because you don't need to live somewhere

815
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,160
You know, in the place that you are

816
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,160
Or, how do you say that?

817
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,160
I don't know

818
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,160
What are you trying to say?

819
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,160
Do you have a day geworden?

820
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,160
Represent?

821
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
Yes

822
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,160
You don't have to live there

823
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,160
But I love to be British

824
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,160
I've been British all the time

825
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
Maybe everything was different

826
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,160
Yeah, it would have opened more

827
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,160
Doors, I guess

828
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,160
Excellent

829
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,160
Yeah

830
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,160
I got a piece here that I'd like to play for you

831
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
Normally I wouldn't put it in a show with us together

832
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,160
Because it's a little bit long

833
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,160
But I was going to let you hear it

834
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,160
Anyway, you just have to listen to this

835
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,160
Remember I told you about Chubby Checker

836
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,160
He was on the strip podcast

837
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,160
Yeah

838
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,160
Talking about how he felt that he's been so dist

839
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,160
Because he never gets any airplay

840
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,160
But he invented...

841
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,160
You know, stuff that he invented back then

842
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,160
Like hip hop

843
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,160
And he said that was the pony

844
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,160
And he said, you know, he had like 30

845
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,160
30 top...

846
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
More hits or whatever

847
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,160
Yeah

848
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,160
But he's really frustrated

849
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,160
But he doesn't get the airplay

850
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,160
Did you just thought I was very frustrated

851
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,160
Did he came up with the...

852
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
No, no, no, no

853
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
No, I haven't lined up

854
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
And now because the link

855
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,160
No, no, no, no, no, no

856
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,160
No, no, no, no

857
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,160
But now that you mentioned

858
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,160
Are you frustrated?

859
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
Sometimes

860
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
Okay

861
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,160
No, no

862
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,160
Of course everybody is

863
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,160
No, has nothing to do with it

864
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,160
It's just because it's such a good piece

865
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
And I wanted to play it for you

866
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,160
But I figured I'm going to play it for you

867
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
But I figured I'm going to play it for you

868
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,160
Might as well do it on the show

869
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,160
So then I can play it for everyone

870
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
Yeah, yeah

871
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,160
Yeah, yeah

872
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
No link with frustration

873
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
Okay

874
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,160
Okay

875
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
So

876
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,160
Chubby Checker is saying that he's frustrated

877
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,160
That he doesn't get any airplay

878
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,160
He says, you know, it should be

879
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,160
The Beatles, Elvis Presley, and Chubby Checker

880
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,160
He felt that he belonged

881
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,160
You know, in that triage

882
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,160
And I didn't know much about the history of Chubby Checker

883
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,160
Do you know anything about Chubby Checker?

884
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,160
Well, I remember

885
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
I remember

886
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,160
It's so clearly seeing it on the news

887
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
On the news

888
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,160
On the news

889
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,160
There was a big thing

890
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,160
When Chubby Checker came to Holland

891
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,160
And he had this hit

892
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Twist

893
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,160
Right

894
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,160
And they even showed it on the NTS

895
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
The Dutch television service

896
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
Yeah

897
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,160
Yeah

898
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
Did they have NTEU

899
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,160
NTEU

900
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
NTEU

901
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,160
Steak thing

902
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,160
NTEU

903
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,160
Steak thing

904
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
Yeah

905
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
Okay

906
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,160
And so he was a very big star

907
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,160
Do you think that he belongs next to Elvis and the Beatles

908
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,160
As influencer of music?

909
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,160
No

910
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,160
No

911
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
Okay

912
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,160
Do you believe that he gets enough credit

913
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,160
for what he has done for the music business?

914
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,160
Yeah, I think so

915
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
Because he never hear about it

916
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,160
But it was a big, I'm telling you

917
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,160
But the thing is on the news

918
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,160
Right, so do you think that he's today

919
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,160
Still gets enough credit

920
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,160
For what he's done

921
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,160
Does he deserve credit?

922
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,160
Yeah

923
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,160
He does deserve it

924
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,160
Yeah, for what?

925
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,160
Well, for being the first one

926
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,160
With this lovely dance

927
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
It's lovely new moves

928
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,160
And

929
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,160
It was a totally new era

930
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,160
You're not going to believe what you're about to hear

931
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,160
You're not going to believe it

932
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,160
And I'm just going by the supposition that

933
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,160
The satellite repairman Uncle Jesse

934
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,160
Peter Lee Fenton

935
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,160
Does nobody's talking about

936
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,160
Okay, are you ready for this?

937
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,160
Hold on

938
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,160
We're going to do a single first

939
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,160
Because you know he can fix your misconceptions at any time

940
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,160
The satellite repairman

941
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,160
Coming after you

942
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,160
The satellite repairman

943
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,160
What's he going to do?

944
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
He'll fix your misconceptions

945
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,160
And answer questions too

946
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,160
Learn nothing in the universe

947
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,160
And he can't do for you

948
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,160
The satellite repairman

949
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,160
What?

950
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,160
The satellite repairman

951
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
Here it is

952
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,160
Hey, this is PW Fenton

953
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,160
Of digital flats

954
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,160
My word

955
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
I've just finished listening to the

956
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
Chubby Checker in a view on this

957
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
Script

958
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,160
Thestrip.potshow.com

959
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,160
All I can say is that it

960
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
Makes me live it

961
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,160
He compares himself to Elvis

962
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
And the Beatles

963
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,160
My record

964
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,160
And the industry is

965
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,160
It's probably the best batting average

966
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,160
In the music industry

967
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,160
It's not that it still holds

968
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,160
Maybe the top five or the top ten

969
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,160
In the music industry

970
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
Of all the 60s

971
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
There was always the Beatles

972
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,160
And there was a British invasion

973
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,160
There was Jimmy Hendrix

974
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,160
And there was Woodstock

975
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,160
A score of a lot of things that happened in the 60s

976
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,160
Uh-huh

977
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,160
The number one record in the 60s is a twist

978
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,160
And not only that

979
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,160
Here's the number one

980
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,160
Only on the number one twice

981
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,160
The twist

982
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,160
All of the great things

983
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,160
It happened in the 60s

984
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,160
The twist

985
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,160
Elvis came back out of the army

986
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,160
In the 60s

987
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,160
And the Beatles came off the plane

988
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,160
In the 60s

989
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,160
Woodstock

990
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,160
And Motel

991
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,160
And Ray Charles

992
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,160
And out of all the 60s

993
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,160
The twist was the number one song

994
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
Of the decade

995
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,160
Only song to be number one twice

996
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,160
First platinum

997
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,160
Let's twist again

998
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,160
And at the same time

999
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,160
It was the Grammy winner of the year

1000
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,160
And the way we danced

1001
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,160
And the way we danced

1002
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,160
In the 60s and 70s

1003
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,160
At the 80s

1004
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,160
And the 90s

1005
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,160
And now 2000

1006
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,160
It's all about show

1007
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,160
We took a very quietly

1008
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,160
Hidden in the archives

1009
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,160
Of the music cabinets

1010
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,160
When

1011
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,160
If he should be comparing himself to anyone

1012
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,160
It should be the monkeys

1013
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,160
And Millie Vanillie

1014
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,160
Chubby checker

1015
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,160
Was manufactured

1016
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
By Dick Clark

1017
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,160
Dick Clark

1018
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,160
Spotted a great tune

1019
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,160
Written in perform

1020
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,160
By a great artist

1021
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,160
Who was just a little too black

1022
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,160
And scary

1023
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,160
For mainstream

1024
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,160
A.K.A. White America

1025
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,160
Clark

1026
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,160
The most powerful man in the record industry at the time

1027
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,160
Made a record company

1028
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,160
And an artist

1029
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,160
And offer they couldn't refuse

1030
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,160
And the myth of Chubby checker

1031
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,160
Was born

1032
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,160
When Ernest Evans

1033
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,160
And that was his name

1034
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
Vegas style cover artist

1035
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,160
Doing imitations of popular artists

1036
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,160
Was offered the chance to record a song

1037
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,160
For the powerful Dick Clark

1038
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,160
He was willing to do anything

1039
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,160
Including imitating Hank Ballard's voice

1040
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,160
And taking on the name

1041
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,160
Chubby checker

1042
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,160
But don't take my word for it

1043
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,160
Listen to the man who actually created the twist

1044
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,160
Mr. Hank Ballard

1045
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,160
A few years ago

1046
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,160
I created a two hour radio documentary

1047
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,160
About the blues history of the Tampa Bay area

1048
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,160
One of the items I covered

1049
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,160
Was the birth of the twist

1050
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,160
At a local high school dance in Tampa, Florida

1051
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,160
I had the great honor and good fortune

1052
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,160
To talk with Hank Ballard

1053
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,160
Before he died

1054
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,160
Here's a portion of that documentary

1055
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,160
Having to do with the twist

1056
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,160
Next comes an interesting bit of Tampa folklore

1057
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,160
From the late 1950s

1058
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,160
Hank Ballard in the Midnighters

1059
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:30,160
Was a touring R&B band that made frequent stops in Tampa

1060
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,160
In 1958

1061
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,160
They were playing a high school dance in Tampa

1062
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,160
When Hank noticed the kids were doing some kind of new dance

1063
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,160
They were swinging their arms back and forth

1064
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,160
And twisting their bodies

1065
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,160
Right then and there

1066
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,160
Hank found the inspiration for a hit song

1067
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,160
The Midnighters was doing a dance

1068
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,160
I can't think of the name

1069
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,160
We didn't know he was going to hear the downtown camp

1070
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,160
We were playing a gig somewhere

1071
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,160
It's been so leaner it's been a long time

1072
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,160
And he was twisting about it

1073
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,160
And the lyrics just came to me

1074
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,160
We left the upper and then we went to Miami

1075
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,160
And I got a test with a guy named Hindustone

1076
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,160
Hindustone had a record coming to Miami

1077
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,160
We went to the high school

1078
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,160
He took it totally equipment

1079
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,160
Recording equipment

1080
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,160
We went to the high school and recorded it

1081
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,160
That was the first version

1082
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,160
I recorded it three times

1083
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,160
The story really caught on

1084
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,160
Of course the story doesn't end there

1085
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,160
King Records pressed Hank Ballard's twist

1086
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,160
And a copy fell into the hands of Dick Clark

1087
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,160
Clark loved the record and seeing dollar signs

1088
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,160
Started searching for an artist to record it

1089
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,160
His original choice was Freddie Cannon

1090
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,160
When that didn't happen, he settled on a local Philadelphia performer named Ernest Evans

1091
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,160
Who we now know is Chubby Checker

1092
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,160
He went into the studio and recorded as close to an exact copy of Hank Ballard's recording

1093
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,160
As you will ever hear

1094
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,160
Yeah Freddie Cannon, he had a first shot in Dick Clark talking about it

1095
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,160
And Nick, he knew Dick Clark has nicked David Checker

1096
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,160
And interviewed you in clone and did a clone version of my written a twist

1097
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,160
Yeah, he did a hell of a clone

1098
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:21,160
He glared with the audition about fifteen different people

1099
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,160
You know trying to get somebody that's not supposed to meet

1100
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,160
And it seems to have a tickle of the person in the past

1101
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,160
You know he had a, you know he had a, he has a gig with him

1102
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,160
Presbyton's name, the artist you know

1103
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,160
Then the most powerful man in pop music went to King Records

1104
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,160
Sid Nathan to make a deal

1105
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,160
Hold back Ballard's version of the twist

1106
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,160
And I'll make it worth your while

1107
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:52,160
Here's what happened man. Here's what happened. I'll let it find out. Read it well.

1108
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:58,160
I'll declare when I read the version when he had made a deal with King Rickard.

1109
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,160
Two King Rickard, the president of King Rickard, the lead student of Nathan.

1110
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:09,160
If you hold back Hank's a ruler version of the twist, I will make think of part of the time he had found.

1111
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:15,160
That's what happened there. King Rickard had to publishing him on the fingerprint time and the twist.

1112
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,160
So you too, and I wonder if I could kind of do what American men stand playing to it at Rickard.

1113
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:26,160
And that's the story of how the twist was born in Tampa, and why we never got to hear about it.

1114
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,160
If you've never heard the two recordings side by side, you'll be amazed.

1115
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:38,160
First, I'll play a verse and chorus of Chubby Checkers version, followed by Hank Ballard's original recording from 1958.

1116
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:47,160
Come on, baby man.

1117
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:51,160
Come on, baby man.

1118
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,160
Come on, baby man.

1119
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,160
Let's do that.

1120
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,160
Take me back my little hand.

1121
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,160
And go like this.

1122
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:18,160
Come on, baby man.

1123
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:27,160
Now here's Hank's original version.

1124
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:32,160
Come on, baby man.

1125
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,160
Come on, baby man.

1126
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,160
Come on, baby man.

1127
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,160
Come on, baby man.

1128
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,160
Come on, baby man.

1129
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,160
Come on, baby man.

1130
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,160
Come on, baby man.

1131
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,160
Come on, baby man.

1132
00:38:52,160 --> 00:39:05,160
Okay, so did Chubby Checker do a great job with his covers and his career?

1133
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,160
Sure he did.

1134
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:11,160
Was he as important as the Beatles and Elvis?

1135
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,160
No way.

1136
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,160
They were originals.

1137
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:20,160
He was a cover artist and always will be.

1138
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,160
Yeah, that's amazing.

1139
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:32,160
So the dance, this is the part where Chuckers, Chubby, Chubby Checker's story breaks down,

1140
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,160
is the dance was their first Hank Ballard saw the dance, then made this song.

1141
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,160
Isn't that incredible?

1142
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,160
Yeah, but, but Chubby had a hit with it.

1143
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,160
Right, but, but.

1144
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,160
But if Chubby never, you know, recorded well because back in the day,

1145
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,160
I'll tell you why.

1146
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,160
Back in the day, American bandstand, right, was the place for music.

1147
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:00,160
So Dick Clark, you know, basically, because the publishing writers still with the record company

1148
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,160
that had Hank Ballard.

1149
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:05,160
So they were going to make the money whether Hank Ballard had a hit or Chubby Checker had the hit.

1150
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
Hank Ballard wasn't going to make shit anyway.

1151
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,160
I'm sure he got shafted.

1152
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,160
So Dick, what was wrong with him?

1153
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,160
What do you mean?

1154
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,160
With Hank.

1155
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,160
Two black.

1156
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,160
Oh yeah, he was two dark.

1157
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,160
Yeah, that's what I heard.

1158
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,160
I mean, this is what was going on.

1159
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,160
Chubby Checker is kind of coffee color.

1160
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,160
Yeah, he's a bit like, you know.

1161
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,160
Yeah, so he married a Dutch woman.

1162
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,160
So Dick Clark.

1163
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,160
He basically said, look, why don't you, you know, I'm going to play this one to death

1164
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,160
on American bandstand because he had kind of a monopoly on what people could hear.

1165
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,160
Yeah.

1166
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,160
And you think Dick Clark got also from the records.

1167
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,160
Yeah.

1168
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,160
And wasn't it something that was in Holland absolutely not done.

1169
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:52,160
You were not interfere with the record business as a presenter and everything.

1170
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,160
Oh, I think that I think it's that way everywhere.

1171
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,160
Yeah.

1172
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,160
It's absolutely.

1173
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,160
Yeah.

1174
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,160
I mean, that's the machine.

1175
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,160
That's the machine.

1176
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,160
But the American there was normal probably.

1177
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,160
Yeah, but, you know, this is, this is what we're breaking through.

1178
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,160
Baby.

1179
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,160
Stopping all that shit.

1180
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,160
Yeah.

1181
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,160
Yeah.

1182
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,160
Yeah.

1183
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,160
Anyway, yeah, I think he's cool.

1184
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,160
And he was the first one that we saw doing the twist.

1185
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,160
He did that very well.

1186
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,160
And we loved it.

1187
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,160
He just has the tone down.

1188
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,160
I mean, yeah, if you hear that whole interview, the whole interview was about

1189
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
Chubby Checker.

1190
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,160
While I was listening to him.

1191
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,160
Yes, man.

1192
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:32,160
I remember that he, he, we know him as a man with a lot of attitude.

1193
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,160
And I think that he still got it.

1194
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,160
He's still got it too.

1195
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,160
And I think that ruined his career a lot.

1196
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:44,160
He probably convinced himself that he really did, you know, come up with the twist.

1197
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,160
Nothing wrong with thinking.

1198
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,160
It's always good to think more of yourself than, you know, it's, it helps a little bit.

1199
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,160
Yeah, but I think it's at the same time was also a frustration that he didn't actually.

1200
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,160
Yeah.

1201
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,160
And that's, that's what you hear.

1202
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,160
Well, sometimes you have people with a character like that.

1203
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,160
Yeah.

1204
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,160
You know, whatever they do, they just think the frustrated.

1205
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,160
And I know he did, but he married Miss Holland.

1206
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,160
Yeah, you got a good look or didn't he?

1207
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,160
Yeah.

1208
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,160
I mean, I bet you they're still married.

1209
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,160
I think they're still married.

1210
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,160
I think that a very good marriage, a beautiful daughter's beautiful children.

1211
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,160
And you always turn this, turn this something positive baby.

1212
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,160
That's so good of you.

1213
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
Oh, I know.

1214
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,160
So good of you.

1215
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,160
All right, we should stop.

1216
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,160
I do have, um, like, that's it.

1217
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,160
That was a very interesting story, Mr. Curry.

1218
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,160
Yeah, I thought you'd like that.

1219
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,160
Yeah, I enjoyed that.

1220
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,160
Oh, thank you.

1221
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,160
Thank you.

1222
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,160
Thank you.

1223
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,160
Oh, shoot.

1224
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,160
That reminds me.

1225
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,160
I've, uh, another draft.

1226
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,160
On the draft?

1227
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,160
No, not another draft.

1228
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,160
Um, so I had another contest.

1229
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:52,160
Uh, you know, at the end of each podcast, uh, on pod show you here, um, get more great pot.

1230
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:57,160
Get this podcast and more great ones like it on the high performance podcast,

1231
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,160
the little reading network from pod show and limelight networks.

1232
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,160
And then you hear this, oh, I love it.

1233
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,160
Yeah.

1234
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,160
You know, that the female voice.

1235
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,160
So people started, you know, kind of guessing who that voice was.

1236
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,160
And I said they'd never guess it.

1237
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,160
They'd never guess it.

1238
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,160
And you know, most people think it's you.

1239
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,160
Some people think it's Callie.

1240
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,160
This is a great brief TV.

1241
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,160
Oh, I love it.

1242
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,160
That's kind of what it is.

1243
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,160
Yeah.

1244
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,160
But it's not you.

1245
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,160
You didn't do it.

1246
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,160
No.

1247
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,160
Uh, and I told people to go to daily source code.com and, uh,

1248
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,160
uh, enter what they thought was the right answer.

1249
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,160
And Rob us didn't.

1250
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,160
Rob us didn't.

1251
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,160
Rob us didn't.

1252
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,160
Just Rob.

1253
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,160
His comment is there.

1254
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,160
Posted eight eight two thousand six at twelve twenty nine central time.

1255
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,160
Says.

1256
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,160
P. W. Fenton's wife.

1257
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,160
Roz.

1258
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,160
What?

1259
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,160
Yeah. He got it right.

1260
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,160
I have no idea how we figured that one out.

1261
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,160
But he got it right.

1262
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,160
So he wins it.

1263
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,160
What should he win?

1264
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,160
He wins a prize.

1265
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,160
I hadn't figured out what the prize was yet.

1266
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,160
What should I give him?

1267
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,160
Do you have some panties?

1268
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,160
We can give away.

1269
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,160
Yeah.

1270
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,160
One of Patricia's panties.

1271
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,160
Can I have, can I go with you autograph him?

1272
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,160
Yes.

1273
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,160
Just one.

1274
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,160
All right.

1275
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,160
Yeah.

1276
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,160
Oh, we can do lots of contests with that.

1277
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,160
Cool.

1278
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,160
Yeah.

1279
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,160
Okay.

1280
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,160
So Rob, congratulations.

1281
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,160
Yeah.

1282
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,160
Really.

1283
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,160
Yeah. That's cool.

1284
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,160
That's a good present.

1285
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,160
You, you would thought it.

1286
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,160
Yeah.

1287
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,160
When I just met you.

1288
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,160
That's how you got me, baby.

1289
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,160
Yeah.

1290
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,160
Mm-hmm.

1291
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,160
Speaking of which, you know, our 18th wedding anniversary passed.

1292
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,160
Yeah.

1293
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,160
And.

1294
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,160
I already told everybody you felt that this was a really important one.

1295
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,160
All of a sudden, for some reason, because 18 is like, what's a good number?

1296
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,160
It's always important.

1297
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,160
There's been years where we both forgot it.

1298
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:42,160
Yeah, but then probably we were very busy or, you know, now we're here.

1299
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,160
Yeah.

1300
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,160
And you came.

1301
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,160
I was really busy.

1302
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,160
I just came back from America.

1303
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,160
And then it's like, oh, shit.

1304
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,160
Tomorrow's our wedding anniversary.

1305
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,160
So I didn't have time to buy you anything.

1306
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,160
And I want to go buy something.

1307
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,160
But then the airspeed indicator broke.

1308
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,160
So we were too late to go buy anything in Holland when I was.

1309
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,160
Oh, you thought it was a nice day.

1310
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,160
I, I'll go flying.

1311
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,160
That was, you flew off.

1312
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,160
I fucked that up, didn't I?

1313
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,160
Yeah.

1314
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,160
And then he came home.

1315
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,160
That's it, tell it.

1316
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,160
And he hurts.

1317
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,160
Do you think we look so bad?

1318
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,160
So bunches of, or it's free.

1319
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,160
Three, three.

1320
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,160
Three bunches of, who was all that flowers.

1321
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,160
It was the last ones at the gas station.

1322
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,160
Brownleeves.

1323
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:24,160
And, and then those green curly stamps in it that I really hate.

1324
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,160
That they put in every, every bunch of shitty flowers.

1325
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,160
You know, that's new, that's new way flowers.

1326
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,160
I don't know what it is.

1327
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,160
So sort of stamps with nothing with one leave.

1328
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,160
It's in there.

1329
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,160
And he said, yeah, I thought you'd like those.

1330
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,160
I said, you know, yeah, I don't like them.

1331
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,160
I hate them.

1332
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,160
I'm an old fashion woman like beautiful flowers.

1333
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,160
Beautiful pink and white and gorgeous.

1334
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,160
And, you know, not green stamps.

1335
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,160
I said, I was sorry.

1336
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,160
And they were so old.

1337
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,160
They were they stink.

1338
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,160
Unbelievable.

1339
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,160
Okay.

1340
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,160
At the column real short.

1341
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,160
And.

1342
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,160
But.

1343
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,160
I put them in vones room.

1344
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,160
Which you, she will think, oh, that's nice.

1345
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,160
Got a bunch of flowers here.

1346
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,160
They're old, but.

1347
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,160
Stinky, but.

1348
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,160
I'm sorry.

1349
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,160
I was confused.

1350
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,160
I really was.

1351
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,160
I hadn't thought about it when I made the appointment to go flying.

1352
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,160
I just wanted to go flying.

1353
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,160
It been, it been three weeks.

1354
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,160
I had a rough time before that.

1355
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,160
I just wanted to go flying.

1356
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,160
And I didn't think about it.

1357
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,160
Yeah.

1358
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,160
But I love you.

1359
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,160
Yeah.

1360
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,160
I love you.

1361
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,160
Just because of you.

1362
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:39,160
Well, 18 actually happens to be a very important number.

1363
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,160
Yeah.

1364
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,160
Did you know that?

1365
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,160
Listen.

1366
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,160
I told you.

1367
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,160
Hey, Adam, this is Tom Rockle from Buck.

1368
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,160
I drive time podcasts.

1369
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,160
Listen in the number 436.

1370
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:52,160
And heard you say that you guys had kind of decided for some reason that number 18 in your

1371
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,160
anniversary would be special.

1372
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:58,160
Well, number 18 in a Jewish context is very special.

1373
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,160
That's why 18's wedding anniversary.

1374
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,160
And that kind of stuff is is really important because 18 is the number for life.

1375
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,160
So when you say, look, I am, which is too life.

1376
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:14,160
You're actually also saying, two 18 because high or a wife is the number 18.

1377
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,160
And so I'm sitting there thinking that to myself,

1378
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,160
it was like, I bet you didn't even know that.

1379
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:23,160
And then immediately after you say that, you follow it up with or you day.

1380
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,160
A subliminal context or just a just happens dance.

1381
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,160
I don't know.

1382
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,160
Talk to you later.

1383
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,160
See?

1384
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,160
Oh, by the way.

1385
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,160
Full order.

1386
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,160
Full order.

1387
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,160
See?

1388
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,160
You were Shalamil.

1389
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,160
Shalamil.

1390
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,160
That day you were Shalamil.

1391
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,160
The chicks is calling me a Shalamil.

1392
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,160
Yep.

1393
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,160
Stop already.

1394
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,160
Yep.

1395
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,160
Okay.

1396
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,160
Yeah, I'm done.

1397
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,160
I feel, I feel bad now because I'm a bad husband.

1398
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,160
Good.

1399
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,160
I'm a bad, bad husband.

1400
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,160
Yeah.

1401
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:58,160
But I have to say sometimes when you come home, you just have gifts.

1402
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,160
Just like that.

1403
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,160
Just because.

1404
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,160
Very nice.

1405
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,160
This is true.

1406
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,160
Nice.

1407
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,160
I don't know what the message is.

1408
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,160
But a nice eye cream.

1409
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,160
The must be a mess.

1410
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,160
No, there's no fucking message there.

1411
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,160
No, no.

1412
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,160
No.

1413
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,160
It's.

1414
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,160
You're looking.

1415
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,160
Look, where do I get a chance to shop?

1416
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,160
This is exactly two places.

1417
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,160
You're sitting in a play airport at the airport or in the plane.

1418
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,160
Yeah.

1419
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:27,160
Although sometimes if I do go out shopping for myself, I'm always looking for stuff for you.

1420
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:32,160
If I go in, but this like one time in three weeks in San Francisco that actually went out to market street or something to go get something.

1421
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,160
Yeah.

1422
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,160
I didn't buy anything.

1423
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,160
I bought nothing.

1424
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,160
Yeah.

1425
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,160
So.

1426
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,160
But I think you'd like that because I see how this is revitalizing eye live.

1427
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,160
No.

1428
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,160
New, new, new flashing new at me.

1429
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,160
Yeah.

1430
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,160
Yeah.

1431
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,160
And then remember that boob cream?

1432
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,160
Yeah.

1433
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,160
For you daughter.

1434
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,160
Yeah.

1435
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,160
Is that a message to her?

1436
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,160
No.

1437
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,160
I saw this thing.

1438
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,160
It's like make your boobs look bigger and firmer in the airplane.

1439
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,160
I'm virgin.

1440
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,160
Oh, that's interesting.

1441
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,160
And then.

1442
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,160
And she comes to this.

1443
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,160
The flight attendant comes up to me and says.

1444
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,160
Who did not have huge boobs.

1445
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,160
And she says.

1446
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,160
What do you want to order?

1447
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,160
Oh, this is.

1448
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,160
Wow, this is new.

1449
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,160
She says, yes, I've heard that's quite good.

1450
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,160
I said, have you tried it?

1451
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,160
No.

1452
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,160
She went.

1453
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,160
Oh, I've got no.

1454
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,160
No.

1455
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,160
As you can see.

1456
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,160
It's like, it looks like a socks baby.

1457
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,160
This is shit.

1458
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,160
She had a shining work.

1459
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,160
Yeah.

1460
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,160
I'm perfume.

1461
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,160
You're perfume.

1462
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,160
Yeah.

1463
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,160
Whenever there's a new like J-Lo.

1464
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,160
Yeah.

1465
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,160
Well, fuck the flowers.

1466
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,160
Perfume is good.

1467
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:37,160
But the new J-Lo is confusing because she comes out with new stuff.

1468
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,160
So off and listen.

1469
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,160
Listen.

1470
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,160
This is a marketing lesson.

1471
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,160
So often, I saw it.

1472
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,160
I'm like, is that still new or is that new again or is-

1473
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,160
The model didn't look different.

1474
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,160
Yeah, same model.

1475
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,160
Exactly.

1476
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,160
So I was confused.

1477
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,160
