Delta Sierra Charlie, 432.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And the next generation radio content in my ears.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Fantastic.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's now curry.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Those mornings.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Start off nice gym ass.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Baby.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's not a right.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You should say it now.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
All the things that you know.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I want to do.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I want to be there.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I don't feel new.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You feel me.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And tonight,

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You gonna be my baby.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm telling you that I feel new.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And you telling me that you love me too.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But I need more than you can prove.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I need to know the money.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
All the time.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You should know that I'm flying into the future.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And tonight,

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You gonna be my baby.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And you'll lose my money.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You'll secure me.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But I need more than you can prove.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But I need more than you can prove.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And tonight,

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You'll lose my money.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You'll lose my money.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And tonight,

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You'll lose my money.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You'll lose my money.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You're a race baby.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
When the close hurt don't come,

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't go all the only you'll be blind.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I know you'll rewind me.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But you thought so.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Baby.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Without you.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,500
Free me.

52
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Free me.

53
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,000
If I'm telling you that I feel new.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And you turn into the piano to

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But I think more than you're in trouble

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But I hope to know you love me

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
All the time

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You should know that I like your heart, baby

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And I love the light, tell me

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And you wish for me like you as a child, baby

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And you want a bottle, baby

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Love me

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And you want a bottle, baby

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And you wish for me like you as a child, baby

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And you wish for me like you as a child, baby

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And you wish for me like you as a child, baby

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And you wish for me like you as a child, baby

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And you wish for me like you as a child, baby

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And you wish for me like you as a child, baby

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And you wish for me like you as a child, baby

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And you wish for me like you as a child, baby

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,080
not work. It's been one of those mornings, my friends. Six o'clock came too early today.

73
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,640
Haven't really had this kind of an awakening since, uh, since I got here for this trip.

74
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:24,280
Oh, man. So tired. Sometimes I feel like I'm in, uh, in my own little private big brother reality show.

75
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,640
Yeah.

76
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,000
Walked away from his family.

77
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:37,640
You. Okay. I thought there was kind of a cool tune. I had that, uh, in my playlist on the podcast music network for, um, I don't know.

78
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,440
Like a week now or something every single day. And I thought, oh, maybe we should play it today. Now, but today is the right day.

79
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,080
We're up a kind of late last night, deep bugging.

80
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:52,760
Uh, this is one of those things. Um, you when you get sporadic reports from around the world saying that a certain page,

81
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,640
in this case, I'm podger plus the my page for some people was loading really, really slowly. And none of us could see it.

82
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,360
Uh, I couldn't, I hadn't seen it in, uh, at the cottage. I hadn't seen it here at the condo.

83
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,600
Obviously not at the office. And then last night, finally Andrew Grummit had it at home.

84
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:17,160
So then we got in touch with Jersey Joe out on the east coast. And, uh, we basically were working with people around the globe.

85
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,600
And, uh, I think we, we got to the bottom of the problem. I had to cut out at a certain point. I just couldn't stand in my feet.

86
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:33,080
Um, and I don't think the, uh, the problem has been resolved as of this morning. We said in senior email saying as much, but, uh, this is, uh, that's one of these things.

87
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:39,240
You know, it's, uh, servers are, uh, interesting animals. As are the people who maintain them, by the way.

88
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:49,800
Jersey Joe, how you doing? Yeah. So a little bit tired. Yes, they were at a great day at Pod Show HQ, uh, took, uh, the, uh, engineering staff out to lunch.

89
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,840
Got to know each other a little bit better. So many people have come in so quickly. And we, you know, eventually,

90
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,760
we're sitting at the table like 15 people, um, and all very diverse backgrounds. Some of them have

91
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,960
known each other from previous, uh, work experience, uh, but it was just really good to get inside everybody's head.

92
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,040
And, uh, really, it was an opportunity to lay it all out on the table and just say, okay, how do you think we're doing?

93
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:19,320
Um, and it was a cleansing man. It felt good. Really did learn to shit load yesterday. Really did.

94
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:27,960
Here's an example. I was talking to sod, uh, who, uh, to something. I don't know if, I don't know if

95
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:34,440
you'd listen to the daily source code. Um, he's our search specialist. And, uh, who also has a very

96
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,000
interesting background, which, of course, is not searched. But it's what really interesting is what

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,840
it's been doing for the, I guess the past two, two or three years. And so we're talking about,

98
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,600
uh, the show, and he said, you know, you know how I know when to, oh, it's actually does listen. He says,

99
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,920
you know how I know when to go and listen to a show. Um, because this, this is what it was about.

100
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:58,200
It was about the show notes. And you noticed yesterday, as I said, I changed, uh, the way I'm doing

101
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,880
show notes. So I'm not giving you a complete rundown with time codes. And my personal feeling is if you

102
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,040
want to listen to this show, you listen to the show. You know, if you just want to listen to the

103
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,280
little bits, then someone else is going to have to extract that and pass it along to you. That's fine.

104
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,880
That, to me, that's, uh, that's perfectly. In fact, it's fantastic. But I don't want to,

105
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,880
you know, this isn't, this is my painting. This is my part. You know, if you don't like it,

106
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,800
don't listen to it. Uh, if you don't like what you're hearing fast forward, but I just don't feel

107
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,800
right about giving you, uh, hooks deep into the program. I just, my personal feeling, you know,

108
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,120
anyone can do whatever they want. And so I'm, I'm rethinking what show notes should be. And,

109
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,920
and quite honestly, after I talked to Sada, then he said, you know, um, what I'll do is, uh,

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,840
I'll read through the comments. I thought that was interesting. He says if there's a lot of

111
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,480
comments and, um, and if people are talking about an interesting topic that was discussed in the show,

112
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:55,000
then I'll listen to the show, um, and I was like, wow, what a one-of-mind blower that is. Of course,

113
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,240
that makes so much sense. So immediately we said about, um, discussing how to, how to weigh indexing

114
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,200
of comments that are associated with the show, which, of course, in Podio plus is great because

115
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,920
it actually is attached to the episode. Uh, so, so we can do that kind of stuff. And then, uh,

116
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,840
and then, then my head just started spinning about all the different things we can do with the context

117
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:21,640
of, uh, of comments. Um, so leave a comment to daily source code.com. You know what, and, and,

118
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,360
in this, in almost three weeks now that I've been out here, I have not fulfilled on my, uh,

119
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,920
upon my obligation. I feel so shitty. I have not gone to see little man, the movie. And I was talking

120
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:40,520
to Ron's son, um, two days ago. Was it Sunday? And we had brunch, Augie. And he, he was telling me,

121
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,760
he would, he wanted to go again. He wanted to go with me to see the movie and can. That's how much

122
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,120
he liked it. And the last thing that I would be perfect to get Augie on to do a review. But, uh,

123
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:56,200
I don't think, uh, I know, I know he's not up this early. So maybe Friday show, when I'm back in the

124
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,440
cottage, um, then we'll have a little better time to different, so I'll be able to give him a call.

125
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,240
I shoot that may not work either. I don't know. He says it's really, really good. So I do

126
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,600
intend on going. Um, and again, this is, uh, you know, the reason why I have to go to the movie

127
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,280
theaters because, uh, they really want to advertise the movie on the daily source code. And I said,

128
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,800
send me a DVD and they said, well, we can't do that because, you know, if piracy, as it

129
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:26,440
thanks for the trust. But we predicted it, Patricia and I predicted it would be a summer blockbuster.

130
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,120
So that definitely came true. It's a way in brothers. You know, you can almost expect a good

131
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,400
silly laugh from them. And of course, I'd like to be properly medicated when I go. But I'm going

132
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:44,040
to go see it. I think I'll take Christina for sure. Turning on the TV in the past two days, all I see

133
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,320
on television. Of course, this is summer, right? And the summertime, um, it's all reruns and

134
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:56,520
not all reruns with most of it is. And, um, it's all about Mel. That's right. Mel Gibson,

135
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:03,560
his career is over. The superstar has fallen. It's like, geez, I can't believe the crap that

136
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,680
they're talking. So, you know, look, first of all, of course, you shouldn't drive them to the influence

137
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,680
of alcohol. And, you know, maybe he yelled at the officer and you know, maybe it was,

138
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:19,480
maybe it was inappropriate what he said. But, you know, for to say, his career is, and this is

139
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,080
very consistent. You know, his career is on the brain, gets teetering and maybe he does have a real

140
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:31,640
problem with alcohol. You know, just, uh, it's just people are just jumping on this with joy almost.

141
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,400
It reminds me a lot of the internet, by the way. If anyone fucks up for for any reason or even

142
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,280
looks like they've fucked up, people jump on it. This has led me to the conclusion that whenever

143
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:52,040
you have, how should I put it? Whenever there's no risk of the person you're talking about,

144
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,640
punching you in the face, particularly when, um, you're separated by a series of tubes,

145
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,880
known as the internet, and there's almost complete anonymity. And even if they know who you are,

146
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,960
still, you know, you could be separated by thousands of miles of distance. People will say

147
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,160
the darnedest things about you. They really will. And she don't have to be Mel Gibson who messes up

148
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,800
and then all these jackasses on television are just taking the Mickey out of you all the time. It can be

149
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,800
anybody. Uh, it'll be interesting to see as we move forward in the proverbial 15 minutes of fame

150
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,400
for everybody. How many people really like being the center of attention anywhere? It's just, it's,

151
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,560
it's so easy for people to take shots. This is what happens. You know, I see this, we were talking

152
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:44,840
about this yesterday as well, that I've, I've yet to see a mailing list or, um, anywhere where people

153
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:50,520
can be a forum, you know, anywhere where people can basically collaborate, ever end in anything good,

154
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:57,400
or have an indefinite life cycle at the end of the day. People start disagreeing and, and then the

155
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:03,000
flame war start and then the, the, the, the signal to noise ratio of that particular channel of

156
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,560
information just becomes crap. You know, and it is. It's human nature. I think it's, it's, that's

157
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:16,760
is why we're at war all over the fucking place. It's the same thing. I guess humans just don't have

158
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,760
their shit together yet. And all these hundreds of millions of years and we still haven't really

159
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:27,240
figured it out. In our Troy needs an iPod contest for those of you who have been participating,

160
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,600
what I've been looking for is, um, an even better domain name telling me why you deserve an

161
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,000
iPod. Troy, Rutter, of course, started this off with Troy needs an iPod.com. And he actually on

162
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,440
that site, he had started collecting money for the iPod that he needs, um, and yesterday I said,

163
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,320
because he kicked off the whole thing and I felt kind of bad. I said that would send him an iPod.

164
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,480
And, uh, he sent back a note and said, for those wondering about the $57 I collected, uh,

165
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,880
through Troy needs an iPod.com. I'm going to go ahead and donate it to the blank children's hospital

166
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,160
in Des Moines, Iowa. I know, keep the donation page up until yesterday, of course. So now it's down.

167
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,680
Good. Troy, that's very cool, dude. And by, I think Friday will choose the winner. Of course,

168
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,640
part of the requirement is that the domain name. I don't care if you register it with GoDaddy. You're

169
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:21,160
not using checkout code DSC3, which gives you the domain name for $6.95 for an entire year.

170
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,120
Shoot. I should get myself a Boeing for that one.

171
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:30,200
I don't care if you register with GoDaddy, but you do have to register it. I mean,

172
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,280
come on. It's got to actually end part of the whole joke is if it resolves to something.

173
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:41,640
So make sure you do if you want to be eligible, uh, for, uh, for the drawing, for the announcement

174
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,160
of the winner on Friday. A couple of voicemails that came in that I should share with you.

175
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:56,600
The number, of course, is a new jersey, which will work best for you Skypeers plus 201 6565657

176
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:04,040
or in London, O2076813753. Um, it was a little party in, uh, second life the other day. I think

177
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:10,680
got some calls regarding that. Let's see here. Now Adam and Britney,

178
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,760
Mason, if you're listening, it's going then just so, so. Okay. So Britney, of course,

179
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,960
kind of runs the pod show island in second life, but has, has built her own, uh, pod show plus page.

180
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,080
It Britney Mason, our pod show dot com. This is what Go name is talking about.

181
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:32,760
The second life again. It is Mike Turner, real life name. I've just checked out your page. Britney,

182
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:39,960
looks all right to me. We have pod show page. Britney Mason dot pot show dot com.

183
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,480
But I'm not so long to rise growing there. Um, so there's a, just looking to see the shows you

184
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:52,280
big. And there's one who's been digging you for something like 40 shows, 75 digs, and quite a few

185
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:58,120
in your, uh, underrised air. Um, so it's anyway, I'm off the bed now. I'll pick on second life

186
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:05,080
all night. Yeah. Um, uh, just me. Oh, by the way, I forgot saying last week's comment.

187
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:11,080
I'm a scruncher, not a soldier. Bye. All right. I'm sorry. If you're scruncher, you can't be on the show

188
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:18,840
anymore. It's officially banned. Yeah. It's kind of what I like about, uh, about those personal pages

189
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,240
is that you, you don't have to be a podcaster and you can still promote your favorite shows. And

190
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,560
there's a lot of stuff in there that works. And the people like Britney definitely latch on to that.

191
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,520
Hi, then it's mini Paul from the UK, uh, although I'm not calling for the UK. I'm currently on

192
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:39,320
holiday in North America, driving around my little Honda, and uh, this is into DSC 427. And I was

193
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,840
hearing your comments by getting all spam, uh, at your email, Adam at curry.com. I wanted, uh,

194
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:50,040
when I first started mini Paul.co.uk, and I had a mail to link set up there, and I was getting a

195
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,680
head of a lot of spam. And, uh, I read an article that we said that if you have a website, it's best

196
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,800
to have your contact email address as a picture. So you just have a picture file on the home page,

197
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,320
there, rather than a mail to link. And then the web pool is can't find your email address, because

198
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:08,040
I'll see they can't read pictures. And it worked really well, and it reduced my spam by hell of a lot.

199
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,680
And, uh, almost none now, actually. And so I hope that one helps you out, maybe you could try

200
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,080
that out as a one suggestion and get you with a spam. And I can't have a good work with baby source code.

201
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,000
And I'll talk to you again soon. Bye, bye. You know, actually, I think I discovered something

202
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,720
really cool about, you know, I had all these problems. Thank you, by the way, for, I'm quite aware

203
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,200
of you. The more your email addresses out there. And of course, mine is all over the place. And I've

204
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:38,760
had curry dot com for, uh, krikey. How many years have I had curry dot com 15 years? No, that's too long.

205
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:44,920
That's too long. Maybe 12 years, something like that. 93, 13 years. Yeah, probably, probably about 13 years.

206
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,880
Um, your email addresses out there. Your domain name is out there. It gets on all the lists.

207
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,720
Particularly if it's anywhere that a web crawler can get to, you're absolutely right. That's a great way.

208
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:04,200
There are a lot of people who will say, you know, Adam at 80 curry dot com. That's what I put down

209
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:12,920
because a lot of crawlers are looking for the, uh, the ad sign to use that. Ah, another email address. I can spam.

210
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:21,160
Who knows, maybe his wife will want to buy pills from me. Um, oh, man. I'm so fried.

211
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,680
I wasn't going to say. Oh, yeah. So I think I've actually discovered something cool. If, if you,

212
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:34,440
actually shut off, you bounce email from the domain name long enough. I guess what, uh, even these

213
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,640
spammers are are kind of sophisticated. Eventually, they just say, fuck it. This is no good. We're

214
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,280
going to remove that one from the list because we're not getting any, uh, we're getting bounces from it.

215
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,880
And yeah, so it screws up your email communications for a little while, but I don't know if I actually missed anything.

216
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:57,640
What I, what I don't know, it doesn't hurt me. And the spam has reduced almost to zero. It really has.

217
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,680
So I have to say, you know, a surefire way to absolutely get rid of the spammers is just a

218
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,640
bounce message is back out. And for, well, you know, of course, everyone gets the bounces. But if you can do that

219
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,680
for a week, if you can do it for two weeks, it's even better because man, it really does work.

220
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:18,680
Hey, Adam, jump from the Netherlands calling this morning. I drove to the office,

221
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:26,200
listening to the Charlie of Friday edition. And you mentioned the podcast of Mark Yosimoto,

222
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:32,840
Nenkov called, where the hell is my fucking latte or where's my fucking latte? And been

223
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,960
listening to the, say, the cause of hell way for two weeks now, and it awesome. So the first thing I did,

224
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:47,960
what I got into the office, start up the pod show and looking for the new

225
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:57,080
Mark Yosimoto podcast. And there was no link in your show notes. So

226
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:05,720
try it again through the search module of pod show and there it was. So no problem at all.

227
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:12,840
Got it and download it and go and listen to it and hope it's as good as the particular

228
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:20,440
hotel way because that show rocks. Take care. I'm a folder. Yes, of course. Of course you are.

229
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah, the search is working. That part works pretty well. I think you'll enjoy it.

230
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,760
And I was amazed to find that there are already 10 episodes of that show out there. And yeah,

231
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,680
I'll put a, I'll put a link in the show notes today. So you can find it easily. But yeah,

232
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:40,200
this search does does work. I think actually we're going to start putting that show on on

233
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,160
serious as well. In fact, it may even be today because as I'm looking at the lineup for those of

234
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:51,160
you listening to to this podcast on this serious stars 102, of course I do recommend you go to

235
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,120
daily source code.com so you can listen to the full shows because you only get about half an hour of

236
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,720
me. Of course, that may be more than enough for you. We have a special 30 minute segment from

237
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,680
Pod Show LA coming up right after the daily source code. And I believe today, where's my

238
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,800
fucking latte? It might be one of the shows. After that dawn and Drew, then we're going to bring

239
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:16,360
you the rumor girls. Very popular video podcast, which translates beautifully to audio. And then

240
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:23,320
check this out, man. Peter, you've got to send me more information. So between eight and nine tonight,

241
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:34,280
we have the fantastic podcast known as the rotating guest slot. After that, it's a use radio and

242
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:40,360
Scott Siggler will wrap it up. He's on all this week between 930 and 10. If you've never heard

243
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,720
Scott Siggler and his pateo books, you've got to listen tonight between 930 and 10. That's Eastern

244
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,160
time right here on serious stars 102. You got about, was it a couple more minutes with you guys?

245
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,160
Ah, you know what? Just time enough.

246
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:28,120
Name in the band after he's cop. Nice to know. Roger. So good to hear from you. What are you

247
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:36,440
doing, man? You don't call it off and enough. Yeah. Today is MTV's 25th birthday. And you've

248
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,840
probably read more stories about the fact that MTV is not doing anything to celebrate it,

249
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:46,040
then you've actually heard stories. So I figured that I could take 10 or 15 minutes and give you

250
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,720
a couple of stories. White Snake is a good start, Roger. Actually, I did hang out a little bit

251
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,080
with white snake. Less because of David Coverdale and more because of Tony Katana,

252
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:03,480
I have to be honest. I'm also a Adrian Vanderberg, a friend of mine from Holland, who Patricia

253
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:10,680
also had known for many, many years. When they were at the height of their heyday, he was in the band.

254
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:17,320
And he's a fine, fine Dutch guitarist. He still does all kinds of music stuff.

255
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,120
Well, I could share what kind of music stuff, but I'll find that out. And so whenever they went

256
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,080
town, we'd hook up or Patricia now would go see the concert. And when he hooked up with Tony

257
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,120
Katana, that was kind of cool, you know, because, you know, I could look at Tony Katana all night.

258
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,080
And at one point, I don't know if this is a cool story, it's kind of sad. You know, they've been

259
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,720
separated. I think they're married really only in the last couple of years. And then she went on

260
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:48,440
to date apparently, O.J. Simpson. Now she's married to a baseball player. I think she also

261
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,800
didn't she also go out with one of the guys and rat? So, you know, Tony's been around for sure.

262
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,800
But at their wedding, which we were invited to, when we went to, it was at the four seasons in Los

263
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:06,440
Angeles. It was very expensive, very, you know, just a perfect wedding. But after everything, the

264
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:11,160
reception, at the ceremony, we just went to the reception, we didn't go to the actual ceremony.

265
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:18,760
Tony got pretty hammered. And I really got to tell you, and Patricia will back me up on this.

266
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,160
She was sending off all kinds of weird signals towards the two of us. I mean, you know, like in

267
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:30,920
the sexual sense. And that was really weird. We attributed it to alcohol, of course,

268
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:39,160
but it just felt very uncomfortable. It always felt she was a bit skanky, honestly.

269
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,240
I don't know, have any other white snake stories? Actually, I don't have any other. If Patricia

270
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,400
were here, we talked about the time that we went out with Rudy Sarzo and his wife, the drummer.

271
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:57,080
And we went to a movie. This again was in Los Angeles. And it was just like a hang. He's like,

272
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,840
hey, you want to go to the movie? Yeah, we'll go hang out in the movies. And Patricia,

273
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,120
remembers going into the movie theater, doesn't remember anything because she fell asleep.

274
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:10,840
It fell fast asleep. Ah, I've only she were here, then I could, uh, I could really hammer

275
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,600
into her about how she falls asleep at all. The all movies we ever go to, at least all the

276
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:22,600
ones that I like going to. I think it was probably total recall or something. Anyway, as I said,

277
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,680
Pacific Coast Hellways up next for those of you checking us out on serious stars 102.

278
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,640
And don't forget that rotating guest lot show. You, you do not want to miss that. It's coming

279
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:37,160
up just a bit later. And we'll be on all this week, um, except actually I will be on every single

280
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:44,120
day this week, um, bringing you the best of, uh, of the pod show on serious. Have a good one, everybody.

281
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,520
Now for those of you still sticking around. Let me just look, I wrote down a couple, uh, a couple

282
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:56,200
of different things I was going to talk about some MTV stories. Uh, what should we do? Uh,

283
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:03,560
another, uh, another celebrity hitting on me this time. You like this? Uh, it was Marty Grah.

284
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:11,320
In I think it was 90 or 91, uh, MTV used to do live at Marty Grah. I think this was the second year

285
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:17,800
they'd done it. And I have to say that was a fantastic time to have basically a police escort

286
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,320
24 hours a day because, you know, there was no other way you could get through the crowds if you

287
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,880
needed to get to the, to the, to the French quarter to do, uh, do your segments back from the hotel.

288
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:31,720
It's just no way. And, and New Orleans police really knew how to, how to take care of, uh, of logistics,

289
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,280
particularly in big crowds, just amazing how much patience they have and, and, and how well it

290
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:42,600
will always work. So we were doing, I think it was three days of Marty Grah. And you can imagine that

291
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,400
basically everybody is partying. You're not just the people around us, but the artists who came

292
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:53,080
down, uh, the other celebrities who were brought on to the show, uh, we were all partying the

293
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:58,360
camera. People were partying. Everyone was partying. It was just one big party. And this is actually

294
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:03,880
the predecessor to all those spring break shows. I think it, I think someone just caught on

295
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,480
saying, you know what? Let's just figure out what we can go party and then we'll put a budget together.

296
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:13,000
So we can, uh, party. Oh, yeah. And we'll also do some television. Um, but it was during that

297
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,320
particular, on by the way, you know, Patricia was really into the whole show as your tits thing.

298
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,680
And so she was doing that from the balcony and, uh, and quite honestly, there was this, uh,

299
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:31,240
she has some nice ones to show, you know, the guys. Uh, but then, um, Matt Dylan started hating on me.

300
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,960
And so Patricia had gone to bed back to the hotel when I had a couple more segments to do. And then

301
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,200
Matt Dylan and, and I can't remember, there was some other, I don't know, I think she was an

302
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,880
actress. She had, gosh, my brain is so fraught. I wish I could remember. He was like, yeah, you know,

303
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,560
the three of us should hook up with this other actress. I'm like, dude, I don't think so.

304
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:00,520
Want another one? How about the Michael Jackson weekend? I think I've told this story before.

305
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:11,000
But, um, and by the way, I have no, uh, crazy, uh, stories about, uh, massive drinking and drug abuse.

306
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:16,120
I've, I've never really seen that at MTV. Really, never in, in the almost eight years that I

307
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:21,720
worked there, never really saw any massive party and going on at any of the offices or studios.

308
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,680
Yes, some of the executives, but they weren't all different building. And they always did a kind of

309
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:34,920
quietly. So Michael Jackson was, uh, slated to appear on the video music awards. And, you know,

310
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,240
the music business, of course, the traditional mainstream music business. Everything's, uh,

311
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,920
part of a deal or a setup. Nothing wrong with it, by the way. But when you get Michael Jackson on the

312
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,400
video music awards, you know you're going to have to do something in return. And that's something,

313
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:56,920
uh, consisted of two parts. One was the Michael Jackson weekend. And yeah, I can't remember which

314
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:03,560
video was a world premiering or planetary premiering, remember those. But, you know, we, of course,

315
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,720
MTV committed to doing a Michael Jackson weekend, which basically means four times an hour,

316
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,040
maybe five times an hour you would see a Michael Jackson video. And this, of course, is in hours

317
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:20,440
when every single, uh, when everything set the commercials was a music video. And he also wanted

318
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:29,000
it his own award. And, uh, and it had to be given to him, uh, the first time round. And so what was

319
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:35,800
concocted was the Michael Jackson video Vanguard of the Year award. And it's not just the

320
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,280
video Vanguard award. It was, I don't know if they, uh, they probably don't say that anymore. They

321
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:45,720
may not even give the award out anymore. But that was the point a new award category was to be created

322
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:51,880
called the video Vanguard, the, sorry, the Michael Jackson video Vanguard award. Kind of like the,

323
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:58,680
the Heisman trophy. Yeah. Um, and, and part of that, and that was interesting is that I had to

324
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:08,120
give it to him. And this was, um, this was 1990 Patricia was very, very pregnant. And I mean,

325
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,720
she was about ready to pop. And I'm like, dude, I'm not going to fly to Los Angeles. I don't give

326
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,000
a fuck if it's Michael Jackson. I'm not going, you know, I can't leave my wife here alone. And even

327
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,240
though we knew she had two weeks, you know, anything could happen. So, um, MTV just kept begging.

328
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,320
This is when they'd still beg me to do shit before they started to just like me,

329
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:32,280
because of my attitude. And finally, I said, look, you fly my mother-in-law over first class.

330
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,000
I'll go to Los Angeles. I'll do one day. I'll come back on the red eye. I'd, you know, and they

331
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,680
did understand in all honesty. Um, so they finally complied and, um, flew to LA with Tom

332
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:51,240
Freston, uh, who now, of course, is, uh, head of Viacom. Yeah, he was head of MTV networks at the time.

333
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:58,920
He's a partier, by the way. And, um, we show up at the MJJ Studios, uh, Michael Jackson's

334
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:06,040
own studio. And it was a very, very weird vibe, you know, come in and I swear to God, there must have been

335
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:13,320
there must have been eight or nine kids running around. And they had their pretty young, um, and it

336
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,600
got even more interesting because, uh, how he Mandel was, was there kind of like in the lounge area.

337
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,680
And he was just kind of like hanging out, you know, and he, and he was doing the Bobby, Bobby's

338
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:27,400
world voices, and these kids were, it was, it was a very bizarre scene just in general.

339
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,320
And so, uh, you know, all right, let's, uh, let's do the, uh, let's do the award and, uh, you know,

340
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,560
my, I was all Michael kind of roaming around and it was very, very soft spoken and you said,

341
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,040
hi, he's not a small guy, by the way. He's got to be about six feet tall, close to it. Maybe

342
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:49,000
even a little over, it's quite tall, slender. Um, so I have the award and, you know, we get ready for the,

343
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,440
for a little video segment that we're going to do. And of course, a photographer is there.

344
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,320
And, uh, you know, so we're kind of lining up the three of us, Michael in the middle,

345
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:02,600
meet the left, Tom Freston to the right. And this is one guy who's only job at was was to Windex,

346
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,480
Michael's shiny pants. I think they were latex or they were obviously more leather, but some kind of

347
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:15,160
synthetic material. And so it, every, every five minutes. Rubbing it down. Okay, we're ready,

348
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,800
everything shiny, we're all good to go. And, uh, we're standing next to each other and I start and

349
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,360
then all of a sudden, I can see Michael, like kind of motion over to his guy and his guy comes over and

350
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,320
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Guy leaves, you know, and we're all waiting like what the

351
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:34,840
fuck was what, what is this all about? Guy comes back with an apple crate and he puts it down

352
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:41,160
to the Michael can stand on the apple crate. So he is literally seven feet tall. I have a picture

353
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,760
somewhere. It's been on, it's, I've published it on the internet a couple of times. I'll see if, uh,

354
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,800
actually it might even be on my flicker account. And you'll see Michael Jackson literally stands,

355
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:55,400
you know, four, five inches taller than I am, because he existed on standing on the apple crate.

356
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,480
All right, I have no more. Yeah, I do have more. Should I do the, um, you know what, I'll keep the,

357
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:10,840
the Sebastian Bach from Skid Row, uh, Red Square, Moscow Music Peace Festival. I think I'll keep that

358
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:17,240
one for, uh, for another day. What I will bestow upon you, however, is one of the finalists for

359
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:23,720
our EarthLink, uh, ad challenge. This is where, uh, you get to win valuable cash prizes for coming up

360
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,840
with the best advertising for EarthLink. Visit adchallenge.podshow.com to hear all of the entries.

361
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:34,760
Here's one of the finalists. So I believe it's already one $250, but uh, or $200, but it's vying for

362
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:44,760
the grand prize.

363
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:09,720
You know what? If that were actually one of the finalists, I would be amazed.

364
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,280
That's another song I wanted to play for. Hey, everyone. This is Eugene tomorrow. My question

365
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:20,440
for you is this. How long have you been with your internet service provider? How many times have

366
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:26,680
you switched? My internet service provider is EarthLink, and I have been with them as a subscriber

367
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:33,800
since April 17, 1998. Now, that's a long time before anyone had ever heard of iPods or podcasting

368
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:39,480
or even cable or DSL broadband. For over eight years now, I have relied on EarthLink for internet

369
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:45,640
connectivity and spam for email, and they have never let me down. If you are tired of bad

370
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,920
service, inconsistent connectivity, constantly rising prices and email accounts full of spam,

371
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:59,000
come on over where I am, EarthLink.net. Go to www.EarthLink.net, and you can get a great deal on

372
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,360
internet service. Yeah, you know, as songs kind of go, it was pilot error, and I do apologize,

373
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:11,560
but this is a song that I found on the pod save music now, where I can shoot since you've already

374
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,840
heard it. Why don't we just play it? It's an instrumental at something different for the Charlie.

375
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:20,600
It's a jazz track on the Charlie. Monica Herbsick. Just something fun.

376
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,840
Enjoy.

377
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:25,800
So, jazz on the Charlie. True American art form. And let me make a prediction.

378
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,440
Jazz Swing. It's coming back. I guarantee you. You know how I know it's coming back,

379
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,760
because you can feel it. You can feel it all over the pod save music.network at music.podshow.com.

380
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,880
I kind of feel like I've done it. You guys have a disservice. I've been so

381
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,520
mellow and tired this morning. I hope you don't mind. I hope you're able to sit through this,

382
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,320
particularly because the show notes didn't tell you about that. I'll think up some other

383
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,240
headline. I'll be back tomorrow. I promise I guess some sleeping will make my page work. Take

384
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:58,440
everybody. Oh, sometimes I forget that. Another podshow podcast. Stick it in your ear.

385
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:09,080
Get this podcast and more great ones like it on the high performance podcast delivery network

386
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:14,520
from podshow and limelight networks. I love it.
