1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
For the first time ever, the Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. in one action-packed DVD collection,

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,000
own all 27 episodes, the cult hit, including all new interviews with Carlton Koo.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,560
First thing that Brisco did that impressed us was, we're not only to come in and really read the dialogue well as an actor,

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,720
but he also did a standing flip in our office.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,640
You flipped too for Brisco County!

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,360
If you like the kind of TV you can't get on TV, get your copy of the Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,360
Available now on DVD.

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,240
Delta Sierra Charlie 472, a guy semis and more custom intros will y'all mjones in here.

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:29,360
We're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV

10
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:43,480
we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we're going to get on TV, we need one button for my phone to get on TV,

11
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:53,380
hopefully it makes me enjoy so my hours, we're going to get on a TV, we're going to have two

12
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,380
I'll take it again and I'll never need the trace

13
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,380
If I don't do, I'm gonna know about it when it's right

14
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,380
Can't wait in the way I play

15
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,380
I never dreamed when they parted with me

16
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,380
Look at mama, my name is a racer, I'm the fuck

17
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,380
Can't wait to tell the time for the racer

18
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,380
I'll take it again, I'll take it again

19
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,380
I'll take it again and I'll never need the trace

20
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:35,380
If I don't do, I'm gonna know about it when it's right

21
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,380
Can't wait to tell the time for the racer

22
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:45,380
Can't wait to tell the time for the racer

23
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,380
I don't do anything, nobody will ever do

24
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,380
I can't run in a Westway

25
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,380
I'm near the green wind, I'm telling you

26
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,380
You can't mama, my name is the way

27
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,380
So I'm the perfect man

28
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,380
I'm the perfect man

29
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,380
The genders are back

30
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,380
With the remix

31
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,380
I have to form tunneling with some fulation

32
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,380
My name is Horatio

33
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,380
And did I hear some cowbell?

34
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,380
They're all of a sudden

35
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,380
I love this song

36
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,380
Of course I've played it before

37
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,380
On the source code

38
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,380
But I saw that they actually someone sent me an email

39
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,380
That they'd updated it

40
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,380
Added some cowbell

41
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,380
Did a new mix and that's perfect

42
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,380
That's the perfect way to do stuff

43
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,380
On the pod save music network

44
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,380
Get your shit up

45
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,380
Release early release often

46
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,380
There's no different from software

47
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,380
It's just ones and zeros that you put in out there

48
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,380
Daily source code

49
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,380
472 coming to you from curry

50
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,380
Cottage

51
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,380
It is Tuesday

52
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,380
I'm really excited today

53
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,380
Because we're doing something

54
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,380
So new to us

55
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,380
Certainly

56
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,380
That is turning out to be such an interesting experiment

57
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,380
And really fun to experience and witness

58
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,380
You know that tonight is the digital music awards

59
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,380
In London

60
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,380
It was at Roundhouse

61
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,380
Which is a pretty famous venue

62
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,380
And this is a show

63
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,380
That will be broadcast on television on Channel 4

64
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,380
But not until the 21st of October

65
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,380
Which is obviously kind of a bummer

66
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,380
When you're talking about an award show

67
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,380
But what we saw was an opportunity to really create some content

68
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,380
At this event

69
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,380
Because there'll be all kinds of artists there

70
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,380
Many unsigned

71
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,380
Some just starting out

72
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,380
Some who have independent record deals

73
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,380
There'll be some sea liberties

74
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,380
And deliberities

75
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,380
And so you know of course as a part of our partnership with British telecom

76
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,380
Who are sponsoring the digital music awards

77
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,380
We said let's go make some content

78
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,380
So we had a couple of different ideas

79
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,380
And obviously just shooting stuff

80
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,380
And creating our own atmosphere

81
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,380
Our own party on the night off

82
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,380
And as I was missing in all that visual communicator software

83
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,380
That I do perversion for profit with

84
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,380
I said why don't we just stream some stuff live

85
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,380
It could turn out pretty interesting

86
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,380
Maybe someone will watch it

87
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,380
And we'll just do something

88
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,380
We'll figure out

89
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,380
And as

90
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,380
Things progressed

91
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,380
And we're also recording a show

92
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,380
That we're doing for BTpodshow.com

93
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,380
Which is

94
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,380
What does it have you got it?

95
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,380
Which is it kind of taking the idea of

96
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,380
American Idol or X-Factor

97
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,380
Any of that taking it

98
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,380
Two steps further into the independently produced realm

99
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,380
And really showing you what

100
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,380
What a production like that is

101
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,380
So actually we're streaming it live now

102
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,380
We have hundreds of people who are coming into un-dition

103
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,380
And we said look

104
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,380
We have distribution

105
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,380
We can bring you into homes

106
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,380
On to mobile players

107
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,380
Web browsers around the world

108
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,380
Have you got it?

109
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,380
If you got it then come on down

110
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,380
Let's see it

111
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,380
We've got people singing, dancing, acting

112
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,380
Which is very interesting

113
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,380
And we're really doing it as a show

114
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,380
Multi cameras

115
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,380
And we bought a little switcher

116
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,380
And we lit the set

117
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,380
And we turned the audio for a second

118
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,380
And obviously we brought in the same

119
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,380
Caliber of talent

120
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,380
You should see the host

121
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,380
Over here

122
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,380
She's really pulling this together

123
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,380
We had a good feeling about her

124
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,380
And we really reached out to

125
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,380
The non-podcast community

126
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,380
Specifically

127
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,380
Because there's just such a

128
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,380
This is really podshow

129
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,380
Going to try and involve the audience

130
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,380
An audience that is not necessarily involved

131
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,380
In podcasting

132
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,380
But maybe as heard a show somewhere

133
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,380
Maybe has something on YouTube

134
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,380
Let's bring them in and show them the tools

135
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,380
Every single person that comes through

136
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,380
We also give them a podshow

137
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,380
Plus profile

138
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,380
With the recording of what they just did

139
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,380
It's a very interesting experiment

140
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,380
And as I'm sitting here watching

141
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,380
Because the stream has been up all night

142
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,380
And we're actually doing the auditions

143
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,380
As we speak

144
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,380
You get hooked

145
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,380
You just sit there and go like

146
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,380
Oh my god

147
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,380
Because you're not just seeing a set with a host

148
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,380
When there's a little lull in the recording of it

149
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,380
You're seeing the crew and you're seeing outside

150
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,380
And you're really part of the entire event

151
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,380
And it's really blown my mind

152
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,380
There is something about the live aspect

153
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,380
That I'm just really getting excited about again

154
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,380
This is the only thing

155
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,380
If there's anything that I'm missing from podcasting

156
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,380
It is the somehow there's some magic

157
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,380
To knowing that what you're watching

158
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,380
Or what you're creating is being seen

159
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,380
At the same time that it's taking place

160
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,380
And by, well in this case

161
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,380
Thousands of people are now jacked into the stream

162
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,380
And a little disclaimer

163
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,380
We are not streaming experts

164
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,380
We brought in a few different partners

165
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,380
And it was all kind of last minute

166
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,380
So everyone's just trying to get shit working

167
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,380
And we really wanted to go for the lowest

168
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,380
Common denominator of it just works

169
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,380
And so we're trying flash streaming

170
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,380
Which I'm not too nuts about the frame rate

171
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,380
That doesn't seem to be fantastic

172
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,380
The sound is great, the picture quality is great

173
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,380
I just like the scene more frames per second

174
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,380
Particularly if you got people moving around

175
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,380
And the streaming stuff there is an R2

176
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,380
So we're going to have to figure that out

177
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,380
So please don't call me and say

178
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,380
There was shitty

179
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,380
Because of the quality

180
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,380
Because I'm telling you it is

181
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,380
It could be much better

182
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,380
It wouldn't really matter

183
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,380
Because the content is just really

184
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,380
I'm really liking it

185
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,380
Let's just tune in for a second

186
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,380
Who's this guy?

187
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,380
I press play on the remote

188
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,380
Oh man

189
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,380
I'm late, I'm moving y'all

190
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,380
Ah, it's too bad

191
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,380
There was a guy who could speak dyslexic

192
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,380
On command

193
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,380
That was rather interesting

194
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,380
There were a couple of good singers

195
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,380
My son Olivia is not trying to get rid of him

196
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,380
So you can check that out yourself at

197
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,380
BTpodshow.com

198
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,380
Hey, let's just listen to a little bit of Olivia

199
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,380
Our host interacting with the talents for the audition

200
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,380
Do you want to wrap as well?

201
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,380
Yes

202
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,380
Okay

203
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,380
Right, perfect

204
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,380
We're going to see the full gamut of talent here

205
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,380
What a range

206
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,380
Can you act as well?

207
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,380
Use your mic, dude

208
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,380
Yeah

209
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,380
Okay

210
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,380
Oh, wait, he's actually

211
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,380
Oh no, he's going to say

212
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,380
BTpodshow.com

213
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,380
It's going to be up for at least another 12 hours

214
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,380
So by the time you hear this show, it's still the same day

215
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,380
So it's killing

216
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,380
Oh crap

217
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,380
All right

218
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,380
Let's listen to something else

219
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,380
Let's reach out to a trucker

220
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,380
Shall we?

221
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,380
Hey, Adam, you saw a 30 man

222
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,380
If I was walking out there, something for you

223
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,380
Let's truck for two times

224
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,380
All of us won't let you know that

225
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,380
I've been listening to you

226
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,380
And wonders if you were listening to me

227
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:14,380
My podcast is at trucker

228
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,380
Two times dot dot show dot dot dot dot

229
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,380
Thank you

230
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,380
See you later

231
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,380
Trucker two times

232
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,380
So, you know, I listened to this comment

233
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,380
I thought, well, that's an action

234
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,380
It does little promo

235
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,380
And he's a trucker, right?

236
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,380
And truckers

237
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,380
I guess they get really lonely

238
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,380
Because he just didn't stop

239
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,380
Dude

240
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,380
Truckers, the backbone of any country

241
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,380
You got to love him

242
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,380
And of course, there's trucker Tom as well

243
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,380
Who was part of the pod show family

244
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,380
Let's see what's going on with the audition

245
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,380
Oh, that guy's still singing

246
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,380
It's really something different

247
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,380
So take a look at it

248
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,380
Let me know what you think

249
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,380
I hope you're listening to it today

250
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,380
Let's see, there was

251
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,380
I guess I'm going to manage like five different audio sources

252
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,380
You'll only turn off the audition

253
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,380
There we go

254
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,380
I'm still getting feedback

255
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,380
Of course, because folks are listening

256
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,380
You know, on a delayed time

257
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,380
Time line

258
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,380
I'm still getting feedback

259
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,380
About asparagus making your urine smell

260
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,380
Skunky

261
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,380
Yeah, and this is Chris and Philadelphia

262
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,380
You wait for X.com

263
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,380
I haven't been calling in for a while

264
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,380
Because I haven't put in

265
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,380
We want to on my laptop

266
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,380
And think of the iPod working

267
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,380
Find the iPod catcher

268
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,380
Love the light, you don't care

269
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,380
I'm calling in about the asparagus

270
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,380
Just like a month ago

271
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,380
My girlfriend made asparagus

272
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,380
And it was really awesome

273
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,380
And you know, right after dinner

274
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,380
You know what?

275
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,380
What the hell is that stink?

276
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,380
You know, we both have that gene

277
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,380
I guess that breaks down the enzyme

278
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,380
Into the nasty smell

279
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,380
And to us it is nasty smelly

280
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,380
So that's it

281
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,380
And they already know on the folder

282
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,380
Or a phone folder

283
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,380
It's gone off that goes into the genetics

284
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,380
But in my parents taught me

285
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,380
I guess I just kind of figured out the scrunch

286
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,380
And now I know better way

287
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,380
But I do have that

288
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,380
One in a

289
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,380
50% gene

290
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,380
So there we go

291
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,380
Talk to you later

292
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,380
Bye

293
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,380
So that's kind of interesting

294
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,380
We can actually use asparagus p

295
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,380
As a matchmaking service

296
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,380
Asparagusp.com

297
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,380
Because it may be it works

298
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,380
Maybe if

299
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,380
Maybe there's something to it

300
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,380
Maybe both have to have that gene

301
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,380
And you're compatible match

302
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,380
Patricia and I certainly

303
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,380
Both have the gene

304
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,380
So

305
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,380
Hmm scruncher folder

306
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,380
Skunker

307
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,380
Yeah

308
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,380
Could be

309
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,380
Could be

310
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,380
By the way, if you're trying to get into the stream

311
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,380
It's busy

312
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,380
And if it's as access denied

313
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,380
Or connecting

314
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,380
Just it refresh

315
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,380
You will eventually get in

316
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,380
But it's a new experience

317
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,380
For pod show

318
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,380
We've always been on the delayed timescale

319
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,380
But this is something totally different

320
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,380
All together

321
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,380
And then there's my girls

322
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,380
The list of these bitis

323
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,380
Always doing something good

324
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,380
If you've never heard their music

325
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,380
I should play one of their tracks

326
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,380
Again

327
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,380
Oh, what was that?

328
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,380
On the door just slam shut

329
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,380
On the DSC

330
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,380
They really helped me

331
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,380
Really conceive the pod save music network

332
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,380
When I played one of their songs

333
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,380
With their permission

334
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,380
I emailed

335
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,380
I think it was Lee Ann

336
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,380
As I kind of played your song on my show

337
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,380
I didn't even think we had word podcast back then

338
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,380
And she said sure

339
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,380
And then other people who are doing shows

340
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,380
Start playing it

341
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,380
After requesting permission

342
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,380
And then Lee Ann came back and said

343
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,380
Hey, we're like selling some CDs here

344
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,380
And that's why I said wait a minute

345
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,380
If we can just make that permission part

346
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,380
Really easy

347
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,380
Then we could have something that would really work

348
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,380
And low and behold it is

349
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,380
And the girls are making you aware

350
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,380
That if you want to change the course of your country

351
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,380
Oh, it's almost second

352
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,380
That's San Francisco

353
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,380
Operations working on the streaming stuff

354
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,380
Send me stuff through Skype

355
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,380
So if you want to change something in your country

356
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,380
They're really

357
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,380
Fucking Skype

358
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,380
There really is only one thing that you can do

359
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,380
And then you know what that is

360
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,380
So you see your parties not to blame

361
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,380
Elephants and donkeys are not the same

362
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,380
You better cast that ballad

363
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,380
Cast that ballad

364
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,380
You better cast that ballad

365
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,380
And pick your favorite name

366
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,380
Thanks lips lay off

367
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,380
Unemployment given me the blues

368
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,380
As you vis or hybrid

369
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,380
I don't know the time to choose

370
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,380
Better care the end or aim

371
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,380
So much to think about it

372
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,380
Every day you better cast that ballad

373
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,380
Cast that ballad

374
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,380
Cast that ballad

375
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,380
Cast that ballad

376
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,380
You better cast that ballad

377
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,380
And chase your fears away

378
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,380

I believe you don't, you'll just be sad.

421
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,380
Some folks say the market's gonna take it maybe true.

422
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,380
Losing all our social security,

423
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,380
It could happen to me, to you, if you're right,

424
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,380
Wing Hawk, who's for the war?

425
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,380
He's loving him, he's feeling so,

426
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,380
You better cast that ballad,

427
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,380
cast that ballad,

428
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,380
You better cast that ballad,

429
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,380
and give your business a chance.

430
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,380
I told you once, I told you twice.

431
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,380
Being patriotic is awesome, nice.

432
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,380
You better cast that ballad,

433
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,380
it's the only true American way.

434
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,380
The Syvia's pretty sense,

435
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,380
so you gotta do it, cast that ballad.

436
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,380
To amongst all this excitement and great stuff,

437
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,380
there's some shitty news.

438
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,380
Patricia, knew she had an appointment yesterday at the dentist,

439
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,380
really the oral surgeon,

440
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,380
I should say, you know, she's been working on her teeth,

441
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,380
which you know, of course, if you followed along with the show,

442
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,380
and you've heard her talking about it.

443
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,380
Yesterday, it turned out to be much more of a slash

444
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,380
and drill session than she'd expected,

445
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,380
and it's real, it's dental surgery,

446
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,380
so she had a horrible night,

447
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,380
you know, her cheeks all puffed up,

448
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,380
and just definitely not in an award type of mood,

449
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,380
so she's not gonna go with us,

450
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,380
which is a real bummer because I really wanted to show her

451
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,380
off to everybody and she just doesn't want to go,

452
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,380
and I tell her she looks great, she does look great,

453
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,380
but she is definitely not feeling up to it.

454
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,380
So I'm gonna go with the kids,

455
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,380
with Christina, with Liam,

456
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,380
and with another friend of theirs, Roxy.

457
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,380
So it's gonna be interesting.

458
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,380
Yesterday,

459
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,380
I was, yesterday, I played a clip,

460
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,380
and I told you that this, you know, this one person

461
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,380
has been trying to get me in touch with a childhood friend

462
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,380
who has something in some news for me,

463
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,380
but, you know, tell me at least who the childhood friend is,

464
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,380
because I don't really have good experience with that kind of thing,

465
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,380
you know, with childhood friends,

466
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,380
and which childhood, you know,

467
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,380
I've lived in a couple different countries,

468
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,380
and I just really want to know who's looking for me before I reach out

469
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,380
and touch someone, and I'm not really getting very far with that.

470
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,380
So people are calling in, who apparently are childhood friends of mine.

471
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,380
Hey, dude, I'm Mrs. Keith from a childhood friend, man.

472
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,380
You remember me? Keith's second grade, remember me?

473
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,380
Dude, remember that library book. He's called, man.

474
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,380
Guess what dude?

475
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,380
My brain never returned it, man.

476
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,380
It got my number to $5,000.

477
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,380
Then, in late feet, that bro.

478
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,380
You know, we, I own the money.

479
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,380
You got to send me some money, man.

480
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,380
But, I need $5,000.

481
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,380
I'm in jail, that's why I couldn't call you, because the library book from childhood friend.

482
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,380
And, stock man, bro, I really need help.

483
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,380
You said you did my friend forever to keep second grade.

484
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,380
You remember me, man? Come on, pay up, dude.

485
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,380
I know you got money, everything.

486
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,380
The money doesn't end, man.

487
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,380
Pay up is $5,000, I'll leave you alone.

488
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,380
And nobody, I get out of jail.

489
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,380
I stock you, dude.

490
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,380
The creativity never, never ceases to amaze me. That's for sure.

491
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,380
Let's check in with the roundhouse for a second here.

492
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,380
There we go.

493
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:26,380
There's a lot of hip hop and crank and, uh, high fee, lots of high fee.

494
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,380
What's this guy doing?

495
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,380
He's a lawyer.

496
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,380
A judge's wig on?

497
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,380
He got a check this shit out.

498
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,380
I think we're putting it on podshow.com as well.

499
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,380
I thought it'd get as many people watching this as fossils.

500
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,380
This is great. I know we're going to find some superstars amongst this bun.

501
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,380
So, even Olivia is happy.

502
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,380
You have a thing for 90 days, don't you?

503
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,380
That's fantastic.

504
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,380
I've written the theme about 90 days.

505
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,380
I've written the theme about, can I hand it folks?

506
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,380
Yeah, I've written the theme.

507
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,380
I'm sorry, I'm a little bit discombobulated today.

508
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,380
There's a million things going on.

509
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,380
I got Skype windows popping up.

510
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,380
Trying to pull this off, but I wanted to let you know what was going on.

511
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,380
What's happening?

512
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,380
And that we're definitely going to have a good time tonight.

513
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,380
So East Coast and West Coast by the time, was it lunchtime?

514
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,380
By the time you get home, they'll be planning to see we're going to have the party going.

515
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,380
There will be celebrities and celebrities.

516
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,380
And I'm sure I'll be rolling in some of that some of this audition footage.

517
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,380
It is just incredible.

518
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:40,380
Alright, this is one of the bands that is actually nominated for tonight's award ceremony.

519
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,380
Don't get tricked into thinking that you know what this is or how it's going to turn out.

520
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:53,380
It's ironed sure Westernizers available now on the Pod Safe Music Network,

521
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,380
performing tonight live with the Digital Music Awards.

522
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:31,380
For the Western buyers and families standing over their empire, we think of that thing.

523
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:37,380
We think of a thing.

524
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:44,380
We shunned some power.

525
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:51,380
How it got to it's gotten zanned.

526
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,380
Just lying back all up.

527
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:05,380
Just lying back all up.

528
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:13,380
We fly, we fly.

529
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,380
We fly, we fly.

530
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,380
We fly, we fly.

531
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:33,380
We fly, we fly.

532
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:38,380
We fly, we fly.

533
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:50,380
Time is in short.

534
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:56,380
I'll let it to hot for the last night.

535
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:02,380
We fly, we fly, we fly.

536
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:10,380
We fly, we fly, we fly.

537
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:16,380
We fly, we fly.

538
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:23,380
We fly, we fly.

539
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:30,380
We fly, we fly.

540
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:37,380
We fly, we fly.

541
00:24:53,380 --> 00:25:03,380
We fly, we fly.

542
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,380
We fly, we fly, we fly.

543
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,380
We fly, we fly.

544
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:37,380
We fly, we fly.

545
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:43,380
We fly, we fly.

546
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:49,380
