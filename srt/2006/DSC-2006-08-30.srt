1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
This is Soccer Girl. I just listened to the first episode of Shadow Falls and it's scared me

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,400
crapless.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,120
It has come to our attention as you have decided that Twitter was not a full planet, but we will show

4
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:48,000
you who are the primitives in this solar system. If you do not need our demands, brave actions

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
will happen to the Earth. There will be global warming. It increases in currency, instability,

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and we will start to be able to manifest like a terrorist.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
All demands, we demand to meet the state of the Pluto as a planet.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Number two, we want oil and large planet. It's pretty damn cold out here on grill.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And number three, we demand an unlimited supply and sense sale.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And if you do not need our demands, we will start killing one of the time, starting with Adam Curry,

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
host on the daily source code in his little tiny cabin, in the afternoon 7th of a story, when one is girlfriend in England.

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Meet all demands. You have been warned. This is Delta C ever Curry, four, five, two.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
With sixty million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I come from justice at downtown. We have people like one of these poverty in the right now.

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Well, there's a love trash and fire, so forget about the lies. Oh, I can do this sunrise.

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Please take time to see where you dwell as much like the place I've been.

19
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll wake up white my green eyes for the same reason. You just have me to lie my life.

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It would have come wrong, stay at the street and not rape anybody because that's where I do.

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I only said I had track and hear me about the fact I'm very still busy.

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh, this life is too bad to watch you just go back to the ground morning in mind.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So I grab with off horse, so I won't walk, but that's been my ramen that's fine.

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Just verbalize the way I run, how good I smoke, yes I grow up in this hearing.

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
No life I stole, it's a life I've made, and now you've been told.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Now there ain't no trash bags, I look at the shape, back to the glass and blood up in the street.

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So keep it in the final line, I can't see the base line, but life is broken, I need to see.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh, this life is too bad to watch you just go back to the street and not rape anybody because that's where I do.

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Please take time to see where you dwell as much like the place I've been.

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Oh, this life is too bad to watch you just go back to the street and not rape anybody because that's where I do.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Don't talk about me, wait that I want to talk about myself, I don't play.

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Don't talk about my dog, I have your own leads, but don't tell me.

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Don't talk about my dog, I have your own leads, but don't tell me.

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Don't talk about my dog, I have your own leads, but don't tell me.

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Don't talk about my dog, I have your own leads, but don't tell me.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Don't talk about my dog, I have your own leads, but don't tell me.

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't talk about my dog, I have your own leads, but don't tell me.

From their new studio album titled new and improved, which is coming out October 3rd already available now on the podcast

57
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,600
Music Network music on podshow dot com and of course you can find a link at daily source code dot com

58
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,280
Which is working again. Thanks for all the

59
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,920
Coming to you from the affluent suburb of Surrey known as gulfard in the curry caught as this is the daily source code

60
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,120
Couple hot topics today

61
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,000
First of all plenty of feedback on Liam the 20 year old 21 year old scumbag who's going out with my daughter

62
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,280
Ha ha ha ha a lot of you responded to that also some pod save music talk will get too later on and

63
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,280
You know the typical stuff coming in on the voice

64
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
I

65
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,440
Yeah, why do you put a plus in front of that well that only works in your mobile phone if you're using your mobile phone

66
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,180
Then if you're another country and you feel the urge to call the Charlie you won't have to dial any country access codes

67
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,460
plus one two zero one six two five six three five seven

68
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,980
Hey Adam this is Corey you may remember me from my last year I had last year

69
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:41,140
A PSA that you played on this phone right after hurricane Katrina to encourage people was they could do for the

70
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,380
To relieve with the hurricane effort. I got a podcast the 501 key three cast

71
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,860
You're not calling about that though. I'm calling because right now

72
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,340
I'm a bundle of emotions this weekend

73
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,980
I'm getting married to the girl that I love Katie Roach and

74
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:00,060
Since I don't have a mountain top to yell from I thought that the early source code would probably be the best thing that I could get

75
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,340
I'm so in love with this girl and I if you could just play this out to the world

76
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,820
I'm so looking forward to this weekend and

77
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,900
Being together with friends and family and I just want as many people to hear it as possible

78
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,340
I love the show man

79
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:21,660
I was just listening and it's kind of a calming voice to hear you talk and while I'm getting ready for everything driving around doing all the last minute

80
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,380
And so take care and thanks. Oh, hey, by the way. I used to be a scruncher

81
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,020
Macomba now you can make me into a folder

82
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:37,660
Does your future wife know about it? What is she that's the important information when you need to know can scrunchers and folders live in perfect harmony together

83
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,660
That of course is the real question

84
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,660
Congratulations on the nocturals check in from time to time. Let us know how it's going and

85
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,020
Shoot since I'm naked pictures

86
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,660
portions of today show brought to you by the accurate target cast if you want to hear about

87
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:57,980
The first episode is all about the sound system of the accurate RDX SUV go to accurate dot pod show dot com

88
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,980
It's a target cast so

89
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,620
It's basically a podcast about the product

90
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,580
You might find it interesting if you have listened to it give me some feedback on that as well

91
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,700
Just call in or send an MP3 file if you wish. Hey, I found out about the riddles

92
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,860
I

93
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,860
Got pretty bored after after three riddles and I think it was going to be nine of them

94
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,500
And I was really trying to figure out who this was, but you know it was a combination

95
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,300
If you've listened to the past couple of episodes of the daily source code, you then you know what I'm talking about

96
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:35,300
Really a combination of really crappy sound quality of these riddles that were there were being called in and it was supposed to be a promo for a new show and

97
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,860
Turns out

98
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,380
It was all Susanne's doing at the diva cast and

99
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,500
It's funny because I'm actually already subscribed to the diva cast

100
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,020
I I know

101
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,300
Susanne and Robin of course from inside works and

102
00:08:53,940 --> 00:09:01,100
It popped up on my radar a couple weeks ago and I started listening to it and you know what you don't need to come up with any complicated riddles

103
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,380
It's a good show. I'll happily promote it for you. I do have some suggestions though

104
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,780
The last episode it really got good and interesting because

105
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,180
Even though yeah basically you you you put

106
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:19,220
You put to four divas in a room and you get a lot of diva clutch, you know and so that's

107
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:24,260
That's not it is less annoying than I thought it would be because in interwoven amongst all of that

108
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,660
We're some really honest things you guys were talking about

109
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,780
lesbian feelings

110
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,780
masturbation

111
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,020
power

112
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,020
Was it

113
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,420
Pressure power pressure hoses

114
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:46,500
You know if you can if you can just keep the honesty coming through from time the time real honesty how women really feel

115
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,380
As a guy. I'm very interested in listening to that

116
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:56,580
And I just bet I just bet there some women out there who would really enjoy listening to it as well

117
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,260
diva cast dot pot show dot com and thanks very much guys for the riddles

118
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,780
Next time just you know send me a promo

119
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,860
and

120
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,060
It's good for the voice now because the first thing you were talking about the

121
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Charist and

122
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:22,260
The first thing that popped in my head was when you were talking about that was you know I grew up and watching

123
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,500
All kinds of air air more movie airplane movies were

124
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,380
You know either there's a high jacker or there's a something wrong with the plane

125
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:38,020
And the first thing that the air sewerist says to the pilot or something

126
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,740
You know don't tell the passengers

127
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,740
We don't want to fight in them or whatever and I think that's

128
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:52,340
That's it totally the opposite of what's going on here. I mean, they're just like you said they're just scaring people and all that

129
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,220
I just if I took the same approach as the

130
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,780
As I do in these movies and like I'm sure they do in real life because they don't want to scare people

131
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,180
Is you know, I think we all be better if they didn't

132
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,700
That they're I totally agree with you when you say

133
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,180
You know don't tell anybody

134
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,860
You know just quietly get these guys and then put them away

135
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,060
So I just thought I'd leave that note

136
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,700
I'm currently driving around here and

137
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,540
I wanted to call so that I don't forget about it so

138
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,980
All right, popular and that's why you put a plus in plan of in front of the one right

139
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,180
So you could call immediately from your cell phone before you forgot, you know

140
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:42,740
That is kind of interesting and that's the reason I played this this piece of feedback is because

141
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:49,140
It does seem like you know all the old movies and I'm talking movies from

142
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:56,180
Before the 80s probably it was always about you know we don't want to alarm the population we want to keep

143
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,780
Everyone everyone's feeling secure

144
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,180
And there's a lot to be said for that and it seems like we're doing exactly the opposite

145
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,020
really does

146
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,300
from

147
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:13,380
From the president through the media all the way through all the way down because it it just results in in so much

148
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,980
Action, you know, it's a action immediate reaction

149
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,460
It keeps people scared keeps people watching television and keeps people

150
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,660
scared and and

151
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,660
keeps people scared and that's what it does

152
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,140
You know, I'm I'm a bit disappointed with all the aviation podcast that are out there

153
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,780
I have a whole channel on my podshow plus account you can find it at atom.podshow.com

154
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,180
It's a whole channel with nothing but aviation podcasts

155
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:45,860
And I love it because I I'm subscribed to the channel and once I'm new pops up it's it's right there no matter which show it's from it's an aviation show

156
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,860
I know that and so I listen to it

157
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,740
I'm you know, I'm hearing references to the security measures and the terror threats and the

158
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,180
fear that's being spread but I don't really hear our aviation

159
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:02,500
Producers of independent content coming up with anything earthshattering and I thought we'd get more insights into everything

160
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,780
Maybe they just don't know or maybe they're afraid to talk about it

161
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,460
You know looking for looking for some action there

162
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:15,060
This is what this is supposed to be about you know we can get some different noise from people who are in the front lines

163
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,660
Just a subtle hint

164
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:23,140
Was a USA today article that came out that who sent this to me Mark Lawrence

165
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,980
Elite security lines bug some but not others

166
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:32,660
I don't want to get into the whole conversation again, but there is some real good information there about who actually owns the line

167
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:39,700
The property the lines are on what the job of the TSA is and why there can be different types of lines

168
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,500
and why it's not a an equal basis that all are

169
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,940
All are made forced to wait

170
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,620
And some different opinions interesting to read up a little link to to that story in the show notes

171
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,940
So yesterday Patricia and I were talking about Liam this is a 21-year-old kid who was

172
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,140
Almost Christina's boyfriend my 16 my just 16-year-old daughter

173
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,700
I express express my my feelings and of course Christina walked in and

174
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,540
And she'd heard most of it, but she's a you know

175
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,100
She's a real trooper

176
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:22,500
She has her opinion she she lets it know be known what she feels and what she thinks but you guys man you don't you don't sugarcoat anything

177
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,380
Is the first response to Liam

178
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:41,140
I had to look that up Eddie Haskell fictional character on leave it to beaver the kind of kid your parents

179
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,700
Don't want you hanging around with and

180
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,940
Notorious brown nose or towards elder

181
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:53,860
Fantastic I got to get a clip of Eddie Haskell and show it to Patricia because she wasn't in America when that was on and it never really

182
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,660
Indicated that well outside of the US but

183
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,380
Excellent excellent excellent example of the kind of guy I think he is

184
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,260
I had him this is Stephen Damning South Florida. I was just

185
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:15,140
Listening to your latest daily source coat and about your your daughter and being 16 and dating a 21-year-old swine ball

186
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,860
Very interesting to hear what other people go through because it's coming for me too

187
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,860
I've got two daughters five and

188
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,540
Ferry and I'm waiting for the day just and here's what I was told by a good friend

189
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,060
I think you need to take some of those goals records and and various other

190
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,900
Things from your career down off the wall and put a few nice glass cases up with guns and

191
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,260
Don't have to load them you don't have to use when you don't have to

192
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:46,660
Hey Liam come on in man. I want to introduce you to my friends. Yeah, they're over here my friends Smith and Wesson

193
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:52,980
Shoot anybody but when somebody walks in to date your daughter. They should know that you like guns and

194
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,780
That just might help a little bit. Yeah, hey, dude

195
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:04,580
I've been known to smoke gunja and I like guns. You really don't want to piss me off. I don't already guns myself

196
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,420
But as my daughter's approached the age of 16. I may be

197
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,140
tempted to make that purchase and put those glass cases on my wall as well

198
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:21,060
I am 43 years old by the way. I got a very late start having kids. I got two little twins in the five-year-old daughter as well

199
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,540
so

200
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:29,700
I feel your pain and I know it's coming for me too. So I am a folder my kids are folders

201
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,620
And I come from a long line of folders have a wonderful day

202
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,180
We'll talk to you soon. All right. Thank you. I do have a couple of firearms

203
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:45,460
Some menacing looking ones. I've got a Japanese sub-machine gun that my grandfather brought back from the south Pacific

204
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,860
I have no ammo for it, but I could definitely flaunt that one around

205
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,700
The interesting idea. I don't know how effective it will be, but I do understand where you're coming from and

206
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:02,340
You just wait my friend. Call back in and what about 11 years when your first kid hit 16? We'll talk again then, okay?

207
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:08,100
And whenever there's something that is troubling me whenever there's something that that I need to learn whenever

208
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,900
I need to just like in shadow falls. I need to turn to my elders for answers. There he is!

209
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,860
Oh

210
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:25,060
You've got questions. He's got a sad life repair man coming after you sad life repair man

211
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:29,780
What's he gonna do? He'll fit your misconceptions and answer questions to

212
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:35,300
There's nothing in the universe that he can't do for you sad life repair man

213
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,140
Sad life repair man

214
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,300
Yeah

215
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,300
My body. Uncle Jesse

216
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:49,620
Peter give me some advice on Liam first. I got to say I always love it when Patricia's on

217
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:57,140
But having raised two girls I was screaming during yesterday's show in fact when Christina showed up

218
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:03,140
I had to play that section three times because I was laughing so hard. I was missing stuff

219
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,620
That girl has a sharp wit

220
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
But that's not why I'm here

221
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,460
Because of your description of uneasiness looking at all of those

222
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,620
Hot young babes the same age as your daughter. I had a similar experience once

223
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,380
One of my daughters brought a girlfriend home one

224
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,700
Summer after noon and they asked if they could change the channel on the TV to see something on MTV

225
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,220
Shoot it might even have been you. I don't remember and here's why I don't remember

226
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,180
My daughter's guest

227
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,020
late on the floor on her stomach in front of the TV

228
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,100
Prophing up her head with her hands elbows on the floor. I

229
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,780
Was seated on a sofa behind her. I

230
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,580
Happened to look down at her

231
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,060
She took my breath away

232
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,020
She was wearing

233
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,540
tiny little

234
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,540
Terry cloth shorts

235
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:10,500
Her beautifully smooth tan legs revealed the faintest whispers of tiny

236
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,540
Laund hares listening in the sunlight streaming from the window

237
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,860
I followed her legs with my eyes

238
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,460
First those perfectly curved calves

239
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:31,300
Then to her firm young thighs and then to the curve of her ample but a

240
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,060
Extending out of those tiny little shorts

241
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:44,260
Immediately I could feel myself responding physically to this incredibly

242
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Lushes sight

243
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:54,340
Almost as quickly my mind started trying to construct some fantasy some scenario and then she turned and spoke

244
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,500
Thanks for letting us watch that Mr. Fenton

245
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,380
What channel were you watching? I'll switch it back for you

246
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,900
Never had the words

247
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,380
Mr. Fenton ever cut so deeply

248
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,820
Clearly I was a ledgerous old man who should be ashamed of himself

249
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,220
Please this is between you and I

250
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,180
Don't ever speak of this

251
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,100
That was just about the most disturbing thing you've ever sent to me, Peter

252
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,060
What the hell is wrong with you, man

253
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,580
All right, thanks for the advice I guess

254
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:41,460
Yeah, it got worse and really got worse yesterday. I didn't even realize how much worse it got

255
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,340
I'm total doofus showing my age

256
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,340
AC

257
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,340
Prof Ross here

258
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,340
It was named to

259
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:59,620
Do see four five one. I just get this out feeling that Christina and Liam are just cringing when you originally called it panic on the disco

260
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,860
Thank God at the end of it. You changed it to panic at the disco

261
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:11,460
Being a father. I'm just afraid my daughter's gonna laugh at me one day and I don't know if we want Liam out of the picture

262
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,460
We got to get the names of her bands right

263
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
That's it, man

264
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,980
Scrunch her then fold there. I

265
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,220
Can't believe I did though. I didn't go back and listen so I take your word for it

266
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,460
Probably my brain was going a little bit too fast for my mouth and I wanted to say panic

267
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,580
I could have said panic on the disco panic at the disco on the podcast music network

268
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:38,420
That's probably where I got messed up. Yeah, yeah, that would be like really really stupid

269
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,060
She didn't correct me so she may not have caught onto it immediately because

270
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,140
Usually she does correct me

271
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,100
Quickly when I say something stupid. Oh, but it got much worse

272
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,580
Hey Adam was there from the doctor's your podcast right here

273
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,140
Wait wait some listen the new Charlie

274
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,700
What is it that's so 451

275
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,740
panic at the disco

276
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,740
But the sins and not the tragedies

277
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,900
This song is following me following me every bar. I have a club every radio station

278
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,340
I listen to every store the freaking wall everywhere for Christ's I was

279
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,020
I

280
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,340
Skate this song. I was a freaking wall man

281
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:21,460
It's by the order and I have the goddamn song now. It's on my morning Charlie. I'm trying to have a cup of coffee

282
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,060
Well, he late afternoon when I call out of my heart at whole bed

283
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,780
Had my cup of coffee, you know listen to Charlie

284
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,700
That is that song again. Oh my god. I had her to song to follow me this way

285
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:37,620
Says mercy plague and their dance sexy Danny. I'm quite out with a heavy people ever heard of changing the goddamn song

286
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,340
To grab an all forgetting another band. It's on the right traditional radio

287
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,140
Yeah, coming like I'm modified folder

288
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,460
I took all of it around the hand move it from the head and set a hand and then I use it

289
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,780
Great, find us at Dorcissure dot blog spot dot com door to be

290
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,860
Yeah nice phone connection

291
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,660
Yeah, try some decuffs and say on next time, maybe you know

292
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,300
That's interesting point you make there

293
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:14,660
I have not heard that song before the first time I heard it is when it showed up in a top 10 list in the pod tip music network

294
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,380
I saw that it had just been added to the PMN

295
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,420
I know panic at the disco are of course

296
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:26,100
I'm not familiar with what their current singles are. I just don't listen to the radio in the car

297
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:30,820
Sometimes I'll turn on BBC, but it's usually more talk than then music sometimes virgin radio

298
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,060
But then it's more because of my sentiment to my age

299
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,140
Um

300
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,140
Who is that interesting

301
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:44,020
That it's kind of a reverse role play here instead of the you know the the young up and coming hip stuff

302
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:48,900
That is independent coming through what we used to call college radio making it into mainstream now

303
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:54,820
It's these mainstream players who are trying to make it into my world from the reverse direction

304
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,380
Now I may not be the norm

305
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,380
But I think it's pretty interesting to see this happen

306
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,180
There's also some some big issues with

307
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,740
Established artists putting their music on the ponts hit music network

308
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:12,900
Which are going to discuss in the continuing podcast of the daily source code those of you checking out serious stars one

309
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,900
Oh two if you want to hear that part of the conversation

310
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:20,420
Go to daily source code calm listen to the show. It's episode dsc four five two

311
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,740
We got more cool stuff for you guys and

312
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:29,060
Here on the podcast let me get it started because there's some issues outside the United States that

313
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,340
I haven't really been ignoring them. I've heard about them, but finally someone put it into a concise

314
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,900
audio feedback and

315
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:42,420
Was talk about it. Hi Adam. This is Norman from the German noncast podcast together with two other people

316
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,020
I'm also doing the pot parade the so-called potsafe music charts

317
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,020
Which is very popular year in Germany

318
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:55,380
Every fortnight we present potsafe music in a way that can be compared to traditional radio charge shows for example from the eighties

319
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,180
But of course, it's free and available as a podcast

320
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:05,540
Love the German accents. Yeah, and your English is impeccable dude. It's so incredibly good. You're it's nice

321
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:11,140
It's very nice to listen to but it's it's kind of funny the same time. It's like Colonel Klink sending me audio feedback

322
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,780
Many tracks are taken from the potsafe music network as well and until now it was very pleasing

323
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:21,380
Because these bands and artists listed there often is established nice and productive email contacts with us

324
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,620
Right on okay

325
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:30,100
I'm with you so far at the moment. We are experiencing some new and unforeseeable difficulties because of the fact

326
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,660
That several well-known bands are now listed in the potsafe music network

327
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:42,100
He is Jürgen another well-known potcaster from Germany who is also playing potsafe music in a popular weekly podcast show dude

328
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:47,700
It's just like a multi report from Germany. Hi Adam. This is Jürgen from the German podcast cafe

329
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:53,300
There are some serious issues and a lot of emotional discussions in German podcast forums

330
00:25:53,620 --> 00:26:04,580
Concerning the PMN and music from well-known artists in the PMN as depurble or toothpick or panic at the disco or Alice Cooper or James Brown

331
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,180
Could you please send me a link to where these forums are I mean?

332
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,300
I'm subscribed to a couple different

333
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:18,260
RSS feeds German podcast RSS feeds, but if you could really show me where the conversation is going because it's

334
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,380
When I just parse my news reader, you know, it's it doesn't always pop out and I can't always get

335
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,620
Context without seeing you know the full story

336
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,260
Just the the synopsis isn't enough for me. I can read the German

337
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,580
I just need to really focus on it. Please send me some URLs where I can follow along with this conversation

338
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,620
But I know where you're going because this is a big one. Lee to mention two of them

339
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:44,900
We cannot believe and by the way German lawyers confirmed to that not officially but in private discussions

340
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:51,140
That these songs are really potsafe because they are listed in the German Gema or American ASCAP

341
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,980
Database by the majority

342
00:26:53,460 --> 00:27:01,940
Playing these songs in a podcast would violate German copyright law and I predict the German Gema would sue every podcast that was playing these songs

343
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:09,060
Without a so called newly created podcast license from Gema. Okay, let me just hop into this for a second

344
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:14,260
There is a difference in jurisdiction between ASCAP BMI

345
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,700
Who handle the United States territory and

346
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,100
All the other

347
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:25,140
Versions of ASCAP BMI they're not affiliated in the Netherlands. It's Buma Stemera

348
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:31,140
As I said into Germany it's Gema every country has their own version of this and

349
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:36,580
The way the potsafe music network operates of course was predominantly built with

350
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,460
With the United States market in mind and now we're seeing you know that there are some other issues

351
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,980
Is that any owner of

352
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:49,540
Copyrighted music of the words in the lyrics in the United States

353
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,460
Can offer any type of license here she wants to anyone

354
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:58,340
Within the United States jurisdiction that that much I know for sure

355
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,260
So part of the deal with radio stations is

356
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:08,340
And television stations and any other broadcast medium is hey if you play this song

357
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:14,500
You have to pay a royalty and here's your rate card the potsafe music network

358
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,460
It says hey

359
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:24,020
You can play any song that I as the owner of the words in the music put up on the potsafe music network

360
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:29,860
And you have to pay me nothing as long as it's a podcast if it's broadcast then it's a different story

361
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:35,380
But every radio station pays a set fee for their ASCAP BMI license

362
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:42,980
So that will be if if a podcast aired for instance podcast on serious as a perfect example serious pays hundreds of millions of dollars

363
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:51,460
No, I'm sorry, maybe less it's probably like 70 million dollars a year to ask at BMI and and all of the songs that are played are recorded reported

364
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,820
And and some they go into the magic cloud over to ask at BMI and then they figure out who gets what

365
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:02,740
But for the podcast anything that's listed on the PMN can be used however you want now there's another part to that

366
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,420
Which is the record companies who own the master the physical record itself

367
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,700
The

368
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:18,980
If you want to create a and this is the unclear part in all legislation right now is okay if it's on a podcast is it actually

369
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,660
Similar to a broadcast so you can give away that performance right

370
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:28,420
Yes, everyone agrees, but the record companies who own all of the masters

371
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,260
So the actual physical product that is then being copied from

372
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,100
A file into your file onto someone's player

373
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,380
That's a a real distribution right and

374
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,620
You can only hand that over if you own it so most artists

375
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,860
Establish artists don't own those masters as an example

376
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,700
Alice Cooper probably does not own the rights to

377
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:02,340
What does he have up there? I'm 18 so he probably doesn't have the rights to that he doesn't own the actual master, but

378
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,580
He does own the words and the music so he put a

379
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:13,860
Live recording so he owned a apparently he or who or some record label that he's involved with owns that master

380
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:21,140
So there we have it. It's okay because the owners of the master said go ahead and put it up on the podcast music network and then the owners of

381
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:26,980
The copyright the the performance right the words in the music also said it's okay go ahead and put it up

382
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,700
Asked BMI

383
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,980
Although they do have an exclusive license for broadcast

384
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:40,820
Even then it would be possible in theory in theory. I'm saying for an owner of

385
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,420
Music and words to tell a radio or television station

386
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:49,220
You know what you can play this and you don't have to pay any Askcott royalties over it that would be possible

387
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,180
It would be complicated because of how the whole system works and how it's tracked

388
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:58,340
But that would be in theory possible this is where the subtle difference lies

389
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:04,260
And as we listen to the rest of this audio comment which I do want to go through because I I really appreciate the conversation

390
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,260
It's going on in Germany right now

391
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,820
The the gamma as with the Buma in the Netherlands

392
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:17,300
Have a almost God-given legal right to be the sole representative of

393
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:23,620
The performance rights for for the music that is signed up and is represented by them

394
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,260
And when the artist actually signs up with those organizations

395
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:35,140
They literally sign over any other right to that organization so they do not have the right as they do in the U.S

396
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,540
With Askcott BMI

397
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:41,700
To hand out a different license to a different group of users of their music

398
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:48,100
They have essentially said okay Gemma you represent my music for all types of broadcast

399
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,140
Whether that be podcast or radio or television or any any other type of performance

400
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,180
You own and represent those rights

401
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,460
They don't really own it, but they represent those rights exclusively

402
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,660
And that is the main difference

403
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,660
So I think

404
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,300
You're right what's continuing with the comments he where it takes us

405
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:13,060
So German podcast us would highly appreciate your help in terms of legal security

406
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,500
Playing PMTunes from let's say depurple

407
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:23,540
Why is it allowed to play for example woman from Tokyo even though they are listed and licensed to all

408
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,700
major copyright authorities

409
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:32,260
A DSE for for one and for for two you mentioned that when an artist plays these songs live here or the label

410
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:37,300
Owns all the rights and can do what he wants even putting them on the PMN

411
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,980
might that be the glue to serve our uncertainty

412
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:45,300
As I mentioned before help is highly appreciated here in Germany

413
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,740
Thanks

414
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,740
Just servers and bye bye

415
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,260
I hope you don't mind our terrific German accent at him

416
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:57,540
Gugain is living in the south of a very in part of Germany about 500 miles south of my place

417
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:05,380
We both are and have been very interested in music and we are both record collectors who even know you from your former times at MTV

418
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,980
So we have got a main advantage compared to let's say

419
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:13,460
younger podcasts as who might not know rainbow depurple or Gary Moore

420
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:19,300
But these podcasts who don't know any of these artists and who are playing one of their songs in their podcasts

421
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:26,500
Might get into serious trouble for doing so without having had the intention to violate some maybe existing local laws

422
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,500
Like you can said there are several discussions going on at the moment

423
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:35,140
But especially German right authorities are sometimes very slowly and unflexible

424
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,460
So it might take some time until things might become clearer in the meantime

425
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:45,380
I might suggest the following is it possible to mark these bands an artist for example with a short note

426
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,740
That their tracks might not be pot safe in some other countries

427
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,340
Another possibility would be to list them in a separate additional directory not to exclude them

428
00:33:54,340 --> 00:34:01,540
But to give the people the chance to distinguish between traditional pot safe artists and those who might not be pot safe in the traditional meaning

429
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:09,220
Don't get as wrong. We really like the fact that bands like depurple or rainbow or people like Gary Moore James Brown or Joshua Kadesen

430
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:15,140
Published some of their songs within the pot safe music network as well and we hope that there'll be others to come

431
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:23,860
But for now, it's sometimes very difficult for people and especially podcasts from outside the USA to figure out what can be played and what not

432
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,900
Maybe you can help us and feel free to play this MP3 file in your show if you want to

433
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,900
Thanks very much and greetings to you and all your listeners

434
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:37,700
This was Norman Austos from Gootus low in Germany. Goodbye. All right. Thank you

435
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:44,580
Whoa sounds like a big undertaking. I think first we got to find out if this is really true that it's all other countries accept the

436
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,660
US that would make it very easy

437
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:54,420
So everyone in every individual country would have to see if indeed the performing arts performing

438
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,380
Rights organization that represents

439
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:03,860
These artists that they do indeed have the exclusive rights and that no other rights can be granted

440
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,780
In Europe it might actually be pretty simple

441
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:13,300
It's something that could be changed at the European Union level although that could take a long long time

442
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:20,180
Really, it's the artists. I would have to say. I mean, it sucks for for podcasts or some other countries

443
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,180
So I think we definitely need to put some kind of

444
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,260
Some kind of message up there so that they understand

445
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:32,900
What the risks are but flagging everything. I mean, there's no way. I mean, we'd have to put

446
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,100
a dedicated person on that 24 hours a day

447
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:42,420
I just don't see how how we could actually make that work how make that a viable situation

448
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:47,380
There's too much research and so it would have to be done when artists are submitting anyway

449
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:53,460
So it's a really valid topic of conversation. I want to open this up and let's see if we can come up with some solutions

450
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,020
But I do think you're right and I do think it is because of an antiquated

451
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,700
Performing rights

452
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,700
System outside of the United States

453
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,260
I'll let's stay in Germany for a second

454
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,660
Hello, Deutschland

455
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,380
Hi, Adam this is Thomas long time listener from Germany

456
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,420
I'm 41 years old and I work as an anesthesiologist in a common hospital

457
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:24,020
I'm also a mech user and I wanted if you know having switched to windows know that if you ever use your

458
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:29,700
I'm making a home for the production of Charlie and if so for which step in production process

459
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:35,620
Come on give us a little geek talk every now and then okay bye home and folder

460
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,220
You want some geek talk man. You want more geek talk

461
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,420
All right, let me play this first. Don't give you some geek talk

462
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:49,300
Hey Adam it's ID which are initials, but only a few people know what this can't for

463
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,620
But feel free to guess and I'll tell you if you're right

464
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:57,700
I've been listening to the Charlie since you started way away back when and I just wanted to tell you that I adore you

465
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,700
Patration of course your gorgeous kid

466
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:04,180
I love the family dynamic. Thanks for inviting all of this podcast or specialist guys into your world

467
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:09,380
Um, recently I've been listening to two weeks with the Charlie that a time meaning I'm sitting at work

468
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,380
Catching up and generally

469
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,780
I'll have a comment. I want to add but

470
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:19,460
The relevance you've got you passed. It seems that topics to ground longer on podcasts and they do another media

471
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:24,100
However for me to come and I'm something that happens in weeks to go seems a little silly

472
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,500
So generally I don't call or send something to you

473
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,980
However, I could want to ask you how you're mad. Hold on before you ask me that

474
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:35,060
Yeah, that's a really valid point sometimes it gets kind of complicated

475
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:43,780
Where I'll get comments really good comments on a topic that that you know occurred maybe weeks ago

476
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,940
And that you're right. That's why sometimes this stuff does get drawn out a little bit longer

477
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,140
I haven't quite found a solution for yet, but you know that is kind of the whole

478
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,020
You know the there's beauty to the

479
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,260
Time shifting and there's some downside from the production and to the things

480
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:03,700
However, and good want to ask you how your math was and if you were back on your math, they're still working on your PC

481
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,860
I either missed that update so very very long ago or you didn't tell us

482
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,900
I'm really happy to hear the object that worked well for you

483
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,740
We can both think my red stick computer geek flashboy friend Wayne

484
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,180
So the amazing ability and finding that particular piece of software

485
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,740
I also wanted to tell you how amazingly impressive your ability to go on with such a busy schedule

486
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,300
after your mother's passing

487
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:32,020
She seems like such an amazing woman and I just get the positive feeling that she's proud of you wherever her energy resides

488
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:36,740
Thank you so much for all of your efforts and thanks so very much for the hours of entertainment

489
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:42,180
Information and content that make my work day bearable and so very much less dramatic than it normally would be

490
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,820
I adore you so I'm a further by

491
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,700
That's very cute. Thank you very flattering

492
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,980
Okay, so for our German friend and

493
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,580
This young lady, you know what it's it's funny

494
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:03,700
I don't use a Mac at all. I have not used a Mac in weeks. It's maybe even months ever since I got the Sony Vio

495
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:08,820
And I haven't given you an update now of course. Yes Patricia has an eye Mac downstairs

496
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:13,540
I've got an eye Mac in the curry condo. We use that pretty much exclusively for video conferencing

497
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,020
Patricia uses the eye Mac

498
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:23,220
for looking at real estate websites predominantly and she loves it so and and I do enjoy you know

499
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:30,340
Just grab in the Mac and and getting something done sometimes. However, I do immediately notice that the whole user interface

500
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:36,340
Everything's a little less snappy than on windows. It does have that nice kind of rounded edge polished feel to it

501
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:44,980
But I have not missed my Mac at all. I've thoroughly enjoyed the amount of applications that are available for the windows platform

502
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,340
As an example

503
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,340
I do my video

504
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,140
show

505
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,900
per version for profit. I do that on

506
00:39:54,260 --> 00:40:00,340
A PC program called visual communicator. I've not found anything well there are programs. Please don't send me a million links

507
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:07,140
Yes, there of course there are programs for this on the Mac as well, but this one really floated my boat and the performance is great

508
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,100
The speed of this machine. It's a dual dual core

509
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,660
Intel processor is

510
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:19,140
Very fast and coding goes very fast. I'm just generally extremely pleased battery life fantastic

511
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,140
It's not exploding which is nice

512
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,980
Even though it's a Sony and a Sony battery is not overheating

513
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:30,580
But I can literally you know undock and and use my my via for hours

514
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:37,460
Doing anything not having to take any kind of you know, I just select the via optimize power setting whatever the hell it is

515
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,980
You know once you get used to the machine

516
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:45,060
Then then you kind of know you know what works best and it's it's fantastic

517
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:50,340
And it's light too. It's very very light. It's lighter than any than any Mac book

518
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:55,140
It feels a little less durable of course. It's more plastic

519
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:00,900
I love the built-in webcam. I know you can get that on a Mac too, but I'm just giving you all the

520
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:07,300
I'm giving you everything. It just feels good. I'm loving it. I am I'm not missing the Mac at all. Do I like Mac?

521
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,380
Absolutely

522
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:16,900
Although I must say in all the audio production I've done on Macs. I think that I've had a more enjoyable experience using

523
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:22,340
Adobe audition on the PC for a number of reasons

524
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,940
Not the least of which is the speed and the stability of the programs and

525
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,180
Just seems to be less hassle once you've figured out how the audio works

526
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:36,340
You know on the Mac you have to figure out how audio is routed and works and what control panels you need

527
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,380
to find that on the PC. It is a little bit different

528
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:47,380
But once you're in it, I don't know. I'm sorry to say I just really don't see a difference in productivity

529
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,820
I've been able to get all the keystrokes down to what I want to get it to. I'm feeling very good about the PC

530
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,860
No real issues now

531
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:02,660
I have done some aesthetics that make me feel better. I'm not using I'm using the actual Mac background

532
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:08,500
that you would find by default installed on any Mac computer product

533
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:14,980
I have a dock down at the bottom so it kind of emulates

534
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,700
It emulates a Mac. I have Mac icons

535
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:25,780
That's another thing. I just I didn't want to have to get used to windows icon. So I use Mac icons. No problem. It's just a

536
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:32,580
aesthetics, right? And I kind of enjoy the task bar. That is kind of fun to have stuff sitting there and all kinds of

537
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:38,500
programs out of the way that only pop up when you need them. So in general, very very happy with the experience

538
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:43,860
All right. It's gonna be a little bit long today's show, but I did just want to play a couple more things for you.

539
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:48,900
Hello Adam. This is Karen from Virginia. I'm responding to your request for listener profiles

540
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:54,740
My day job is as a social worker and part-time tour guide on the weekends at a local history site

541
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,340
I've been listening to the Charlie since about October

542
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:04,820
The podcast I'm going to hawk shamelessly is music Virginia dot potio dot com focusing on

543
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:13,380
Artists from Virginia and I just turned 48. I'm divorced and proud of it. He doesn't even know what he missed and

544
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,620
Let's see right now. Those kind of relationships just are not

545
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:24,260
For me so and believe me you would not want to see a naked picture of me and about the big debate

546
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:31,540
Suscending from the from the bottom or over the top doesn't matter as long as it's there when you need it and I'm a folder

547
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:36,180
And can I say tailwinds even if I'm not a pilot? Bye. No, not really

548
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:39,460
But you made me so happy with all the other stuff you said. It's okay

549
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:46,180
Thank you. I've been saving all of these listener profiles that you've been calling in. I have I must have about

550
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,300
150 now and

551
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,820
I'm going to if you don't mind share those with our

552
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,980
Business development and sales department

553
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,860
Because I'm I think I'm getting a very good idea of what the audience make up is and

554
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,740
I'd like to be able to bring you more relevant advertising relevant to you

555
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,460
um

556
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,460
And I and just on a personal note

557
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,100
I'm really really enjoying learning about you guys

558
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,460
I'm

559
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:21,540
I'm not surprised about the average age which seems to be around 33 32 33 I should do the math

560
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:29,700
Not surprised well now. I am surprised about the type of jobs you guys have and what you do for a living and where you listen

561
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:35,540
I this just it's totally blowing me away and I really appreciate you sending that in it's

562
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:40,820
I think if if I know you better I'll be able to serve you better

563
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,980
Are you being so kind of so if you bet about any chance?

564
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,820
Hey Adam

565
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:55,380
This is listener dug and Utah checking in with a little item on a Dutch invasion of Germany

566
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:00,020
Yeah, I know that's a reversal in historical trend

567
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:04,260
Nevertheless in the Sunday New York Times

568
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,020
We can review section there's a little blurb at

569
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,540
About how the

570
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:16,740
Germans are upset even pissed off with the Dutch because

571
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:22,580
While the Dutch are doing nothing to close down the coffee shops in Holland

572
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,460
relying on the tax revenue from the

573
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,780
200 million dollar annual trade

574
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,740
They have nevertheless crack down on the growers

575
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:41,060
And so the growers have moved to the forests of Germany and the Germans are having trouble controlling the Dutch growers in Germany

576
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:47,940
This seems particularly odd. I don't know if there's violence involved which would not seem particularly

577
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,900
Dutch

578
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:59,700
But apparently all the seed contest and so on that's all in a longer being produced in Holland, but in the forests of Germany

579
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,420
I thought that'd be an interesting

580
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,700
Curry for 20 like moment for

581
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:10,980
Okay, this is dug out. Oh, I dug nice. Well, you know

582
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:16,980
It's this is almost like the national hobby in the Netherlands not a day goes by

583
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:26,020
Well, you don't read in at least one of the newspapers about some apartment or some home or you know just the some in conspicuous dwelling

584
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:32,420
Usually in in a in a in a structure of more of the same types of dwellings hence apartments

585
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:40,820
That it doesn't turn out to be just rented by someone who is not living there, but has several hundred plants growing

586
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:49,620
And they usually steal electricity. This is the the only guys who are really going after this big time as far as I can tell in in the Netherlands is the electric companies

587
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:54,580
Because it takes so much energy and they're losing their quote losing so much revenue on

588
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:01,620
On these growers these illegal growers that they're the ones that are basically finding out who's doing what they look in

589
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:07,940
They look at anomalies. I guess across there they're power grid and then they zoom in and it's more for those guys than anything

590
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:14,100
That that they're being hunted down, but it seems like everyone is doing it everyone is growing it

591
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:20,500
And I think you're I know we got the $200 million annual trade number from I think it's much much higher than that much higher

592
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:27,220
Oh, yeah, gobs higher no doubt about it and it's being transported throughout all of Europe

593
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:30,500
I mean the Netherlands is is I think the number one producing country now

594
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,820
Really really huge

595
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:38,660
So no wonder that they're moving down south through Belgium that they're moving over towards the east towards Germany

596
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:44,500
It's just I think it's that they're probably not even going for any other reason then the power company to

597
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,500
On quite as hip over there to what's happening

598
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:54,260
Is their violence involved? No, I have yet to read one report of actual violence involved

599
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,820
These growers

600
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,300
Particularly if they're smoking their own dope. No, I'm saying

601
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:05,620
The New York City to wind up today's Charlie Jody Aaron and orange soda

602
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:34,260
Sips it on the coke and round

603
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:41,140
Wish I had an orange soda

604
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,900
To cool me down and quench my thirst

605
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:54,580
The only question in my mind

606
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:59,540
Would be a great could have tasted

607
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,020
And if this world exists

608
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:10,900
