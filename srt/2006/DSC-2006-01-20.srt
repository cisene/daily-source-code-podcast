1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Delta Sierra Charley

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
320

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,560
A year of Charlie heading forward the highway, looking for adventure and what it

4
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,000
becomes a bad save.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's gonna be Friday, it's gonna be Friday, it's gonna be Friday.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What yes?

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There's no sailbodies on methane hyper.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The drink too much coffee and fun to guess today.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
When you're locomotive down the Stratford,

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
a filler owner with 16 gallons of flammable waste

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
wrapped in my ass and the destruction of the music industry in my ears

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I like to think I'm a greasing up the future.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Delta Sierra Charley is still doingafood.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Little loose Cristo Wagyu

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,540
Listen,

16
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,540
It's first round's on me.

17
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,540
All right, Adam, have a good weekend.

18
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,540
Oh man, where's the stopwatch?

19
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,540
Oh, yes, everybody, one more day before I get to go home.

20
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,540
Once again from the Curry condo, Danny Sorsko.

21
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,540
For fuck's sake!

22
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,540
Are you ready?

23
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,540
Let's party!

24
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,540
Keep me hanging on now, baby.

25
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,540
Yeah, put your hands on the dashboard.

26
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,540
Yeah, put your hands on the dashboard.

27
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,540
When the night on the subway, I'd be on a Monday.

28
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,540
Just a blackware head, the screen and shower.

29
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,540
We're still in the last class.

30
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,540
We're gonna make take a pop star.

31
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,540
We're gonna roll it right above.

32
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,540
Go on now!

33
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,540
I love you, baby, love.

34
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,540
I love you, now, baby.

35
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,540
I love you, you, you, you, you, you.

36
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,540
You know, I love you, baby.

37
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,540
I love you, now, now, now.

38
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,540
I love you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you

39
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,540
Me, you, you.

40
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,540
We're started off sweeping,

41
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,540
you know you're pregnant, you're asleep,

42
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,540
you know what's that all about?

43
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,540
We know I love you, completely.

44
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,540
You're all in this dream, man

45
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,540
Come on up, girl, let's work it out

46
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,540
Maybe in a waste of my time

47
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,540
If you're not gonna go, man, man

48
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,540
I know that's gonna come in

49
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,540
She gives it to you, girl, for free

50
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,540
What's watching, girl, in the fog

51
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,540
Damn it, it starts in my car

52
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,540
Come on, man

53
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,540
I love you, keep it up

54
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,540
I love you, keep it up

55
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,540
I love you, keep it up

56
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,540
I love you, keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it

57
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,540
I love you, keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it

58
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,540
I love you, keep it up

59
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,540
I love you, now, man

60
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,540
Tell me.

61
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,340
I love you, keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it

62
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:49,540

We're ready to come out

64
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:49,540

66
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:25,540
Friday and my last day of our to the two week, the two week stay here in the condo and

67
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,540
really winding things up exactly the way I'd hope they would time out.

68
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,540
Got a whole lot of stuff accomplished today.

69
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,540
Whew, I'm ready to go home, I must say.

70
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,540
I missed the girls terribly.

71
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,540
And you know, for all the shit I give Apple, thank you so much for I chat.

72
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:49,540
I mean, just we've got an eye Mac here and an eye Mac at the cottage.

73
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,540
And it's just so easy, you know, Patricia can use it.

74
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,540
And if she runs into trouble, I can always just SSH in and fire up VNC,

75
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,540
young in the command line and help her out.

76
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,540
You know, it's kind of like the air traffic control helping the stewarders land the jump

77
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,540
both seven, four, seven, young on me.

78
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:15,540
And so that's good that really has made all these trips a lot easier to bear.

79
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,540
Because I miss them.

80
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,540
But soon I'll be back in my girls arms.

81
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,540
Let me see where to start.

82
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,540
It's early Friday morning here in San Francisco.

83
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,540
Got to get a head start on stuff because we got quite a full day, you know,

84
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,540
keeping it going all the way to the very very end.

85
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,540
And then of course tonight I'm hanging out with my buddy Greg.

86
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,540
I'm going to have dinner with him and his son Zach.

87
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,540
And then I'll be heading home tomorrow.

88
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,540
I'm looking forward to it.

89
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,540
Okay, so here's what happened today.

90
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,540
Oh, man.

91
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,540
So I call Patricia on the eye chat and we were chatting.

92
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,540
Oh, um, did you read my email?

93
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,540
And of course, uh, and this would make most of you feel really good.

94
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,540
Who sent me email and didn't get a reply for some reason in the past.

95
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,540
As early as yesterday.

96
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,540
As a reason as yesterday.

97
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,540
Um, so she had sent that it, you know, sometimes I was clearly asleep because of the time difference.

98
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,540
And it had already scrolled way down the list.

99
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,540
So I had not seen it not.

100
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,540
It wasn't on the the main, you know, the the first screen when you log in to Gmail.

101
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,540
You know, it's more than 40 messages or whatever it is, 50 messages.

102
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,540
And, uh, I said, no, I said, hold on.

103
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,540
We pull it up.

104
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,540
Okay.

105
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,540
So here's what happened.

106
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,540
This is now this is quite a story.

107
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,540
Now, you know that we left the Netherlands a year and a half ago.

108
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,540
Um, really, uh, because, well, we did a number of things.

109
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,540
You know, we, uh, sold most of our stuff, our houses, everything.

110
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,540
Just said, screw it.

111
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,540
We're going to go chill out, rent a place for a while.

112
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,540
Figure out we want to live settled down a bit.

113
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,540
No attention.

114
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,540
Just don't want anyone hanging out.

115
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,540
Now, you'll recall if you are a longer term listener to the source code.

116
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,540
You'll recall that, uh, we were in the cottage for a little under a year.

117
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,540
It must have been what six, four months ago, five months ago.

118
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,540
And some paparazzi showed up from a magazine.

119
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,540
Okay.

120
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:08,540
So that really sucked and, you know, they had gotten from a database of magazine subscriptions from their publisher.

121
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,540
So partially our fault, I guess.

122
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,540
You know, the one subscription we carried over, they, they used to find their address.

123
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,540
So of course, that's not known in the paparazzi world.

124
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,540
And, uh, so there's this magazine called Weekend, which is, uh,

125
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,540
builds itself as a family-oriented magazine.

126
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,540
But it's a, it's a gossip rag.

127
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:34,540
Um, came out, I guess, Wednesday in the Netherlands with front page of Patricia.

128
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,540
And, uh, man, it's one of these pictures where she, uh,

129
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,540
she's walking out of Sainsbury from doing shopping, right?

130
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,540
And it was really, really cold that day.

131
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,540
And so she has, uh, kind of like a wool hat over her overhead.

132
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,540
You know, to keep a nice one, we're pulled down pretty low.

133
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,540
And, uh, you know how it works if you take 10 pictures of someone in quick succession.

134
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,540
There's always a shitty one in there.

135
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,540
So, of course, they take this shitty one.

136
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:05,540
And then, um, it says drama.

137
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,540
Literally drama.

138
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,540
Um, and this is a whole cover page.

139
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,540
On the inside, now check this.

140
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,540
They took pictures from my, um, weblog.

141
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,540
Actually, um, there are pictures that are posted on my flicker site.

142
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,540
But, uh, I guess, uh, there must have been some links to it from, uh, from my weblog.

143
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,540
And one of them is a, is a full page again, almost.

144
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:32,540
Of a shot that I took of Christina and Patricia in a limo in New York.

145
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,540
And another one is the three of us sitting on a, on a,

146
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,540
a bench in New York in Central Park and, you know,

147
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,540
me taking the picture with my arm extended.

148
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,540
And, uh, so the story basically is, um,

149
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,540
they, you know, they're pretending that everything is all fine.

150
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,540
But Adam has been away from home a lot lately.

151
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,540
And therefore it's drama.

152
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,540
Things are not going well.

153
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,540
So, you know, that's kind of, you know, we can laugh about that.

154
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,540
And although it's, um, it's kind of the price you pay, you know,

155
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,540
that, uh, that people are basically fucking stalking you and following you around

156
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,540
and taking pictures of you, um, you know,

157
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,540
and that they say stupid shit like that.

158
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,540
Yeah, okay.

159
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,540
So, well, we all know what I'm doing.

160
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,540
And I'm over here.

161
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,540
I'm back and forth.

162
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,540
You know, I'm, uh, trying to make it all work.

163
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,540
And we're all making it work.

164
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,540
And the sacrifices that everybody makes.

165
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,540
You know, yeah, I believe me, you know,

166
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,540
you could follow around Bill Gates's wife or Steve Jobs's wife or

167
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,540
the CEO of Shell or any other corporation.

168
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,540
And particularly a smaller startup companies.

169
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,540
You know, there's a lot of work involved.

170
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,540
So, that's not really fair statement, but for any woman, any woman

171
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,540
to have a picture taken of them when the just, you know,

172
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,540
when it just isn't the picture you want, you know,

173
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,540
and it's easy to make someone look like shit.

174
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,540
And of course, my wife could never look like shit,

175
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,540
but I know what she's thinking when she sees a picture like this.

176
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,540
Okay, so it should happens, right?

177
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,540
We don't live there.

178
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,540
So it's not all that bad and whatever.

179
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,540
And they can write whatever they want about me.

180
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,540
I don't care.

181
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,540
However, two things, the most important one,

182
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,540
and this is just amazing for a so-called family magazine.

183
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:21,540
They published the name and location of my daughter's school,

184
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,540
15-year-old daughter of my daughter's school.

185
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,540
And then just are very happy to mention that,

186
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,540
and a cab picks up and drops her off every single day.

187
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,540
That is endangerment.

188
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,540
All it takes, you know, of course, we've now changed that.

189
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,540
This is why I'm going to tell you this.

190
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,540
But all it takes is one idiot to say, hey, now that's kind of cool.

191
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,540
If I just pretend I'm a cab driver, I can get their daughter.

192
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,540
You know, it's unbelievable.

193
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,540
I just can't, that really, really pissed me off.

194
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,540
You know, that's just upsetting.

195
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,540
And especially, of course, we're lucky.

196
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,540
And fortunately, nothing has happened.

197
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,540
And you know, this has only been publicized for two days.

198
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,540
So I guess we're okay there.

199
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,540
But, you know, in pictures of my house, of course.

200
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,540
And there's all, you know, it's all under the freedom of the press.

201
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,540
So I'm just really upset about that.

202
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,540
Because you can say what you want about me,

203
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,540
and Patricia's the same way.

204
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,540
And you know, it's like you can say, you can make up anything you want about us and our relationship.

205
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,540
We've been married for almost 20 years.

206
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,540
You know, nothing is going to phase us.

207
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,540
But stay the fuck away from my kid.

208
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:36,540
And so, you know, usually, and they've written about us a lot.

209
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:41,540
And usually on the guy that says, ah, you know, whatever, you know, let them go.

210
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:48,540
You know, I'd be much rather be yapping about pod safe music or about pod show or doing some cool stuff.

211
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,540
I don't want to spend any negative energy working on backwards stuff, right?

212
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,540
Particularly not in other countries.

213
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,540
Just like who cares?

214
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,540
It's too bad for my family and for Patricia's family.

215
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,540
They have to deal with that shit.

216
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,540
People always asking him about it.

217
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,540
But okay, you know, so that's the way it goes.

218
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,540
But this time, first of all, I'm really upset about what they've done,

219
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,540
which just shows total lack of understanding of what it is to have a family.

220
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,540
Secondly, and this is where they tripped.

221
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,540
And this is going to be very interesting.

222
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,540
If you look at any of the pickers, pickers, any of the pickers on my flicker side, any of the pictures on my flicker side.

223
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:31,540
You'll see that they are published under a Creative Commons license.

224
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:42,540
Specifically, the attribution non-commercial share a like license, which means you can share this picture.

225
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,540
You can copy it.

226
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,540
You can do basically anything you want to do under the following conditions.

227
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:54,540
One, you provide attribution, which means you have to point a link back to where the original is.

228
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,540
And you have to say that's mine and copyright, whatever.

229
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,540
That's pretty normal.

230
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,540
Share a like means you can't mess with it.

231
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,540
You have to share it the same manner.

232
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:12,540
And non-commercial means you cannot use it for commercial use.

233
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,540
So that's how we're going to sue them.

234
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,540
And I called my lawyers and I said, you know what?

235
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,540
Now is the time.

236
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,540
Now we're going to go get these fuckers.

237
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:27,540
It's going to be very interesting to see what the value of my Creative Commons license is.

238
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,540
I'm pretty sure it's a shoe in, but it's going to be very interesting to see that.

239
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,540
And endangerment of a child.

240
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,540
So we're going to basically say you have to pull that magazine off the racks entirely.

241
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,540
Every single one has to be recalled from the stores.

242
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:48,540
And on top of that, of course, we want to rectify the situation.

243
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,540
So we'll get the same amount of page space and cover space.

244
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,540
And because there's no money in this shit.

245
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,540
You know, it's like, yeah, I'm sure we'll sue for damages.

246
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,540
But the Netherlands is such a socialist fucked up court system with no jury by the way.

247
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,540
It's a professional judge that makes the decision.

248
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:11,540
So there's, there's not any money in it, but I just can't believe.

249
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:18,540
And we also were, we're suing the, the editor himself.

250
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,540
It's anyway.

251
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:25,540
So, you know, it was kind of like a night in, in shining armor.

252
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,540
You know, my girls were bombed, you know.

253
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,540
And they've been waiting for me to get up to call them for them to lay all the shit on me.

254
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,540
And they were, you know, obviously bummed out.

255
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,540
And so I came into action for the first time.

256
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,540
I'm actually going to go after one of these magazines.

257
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,540
It's, uh, you just cross the line.

258
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,540
So one legally on the pictures.

259
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,540
That's theft and the arrogance of that.

260
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,540
The arrogance that you think that you can take something off of a website and publish it in a magazine.

261
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,540
What arrogance?

262
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,540
You know, if we turn around, if we take something of yours, how fast your lawyers are here.

263
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,540
Now watch my boys, okay?

264
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:03,540
Have you ever seen the discovery channel where, like the, the Orca whale, it gets beached.

265
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,540
Or it comes up on the beach and it grabs a little, uh, a little baby seal.

266
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:13,540
And then he keeps him in his mouth and they slings him in the air, like 30 feet and he lands the further up.

267
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,540
And he go get some, he catches him in his mouth and they're playing with him back and forth.

268
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,540
Like a beach ball.

269
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,540
That's what my lawyers are going to do to you.

270
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,540
Okay?

271
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,540
Ha, man.

272
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,540
It's Friday.

273
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,540
Okay.

274
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:32,540
So I was going to, um, open up the testing for the podsafe music, podsafe music network today.

275
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,540
To test the purchasing.

276
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:40,540
Um, oh, man, we had a great meeting today about, uh, you know, how we want to put all this in place,

277
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:46,540
about, uh, the pricing and really about the creation of the unlabel.

278
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:51,540
And I want to talk a little bit about that right now because when we open this up,

279
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,540
there's a number of elements to it.

280
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,540
And I just want to explain.

281
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,540
If we were to just go and recreate iTunes for independent music, that would be dumb.

282
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,540
You know, we really want to see if we can change something.

283
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,540
This is what they call that blue ocean strategy or whatever.

284
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:13,540
I think, um, the following scenario is something that we want to experiment with.

285
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:17,540
So first of all, we all know that these are free and clear MP3.

286
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,540
So we're, and this is, this is big thing.

287
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,540
Okay?

288
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:27,540
We're basically saying, uh, we're believing in humanity here and all the artists who, uh,

289
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,540
participate in this will, will pretty much be doing the same.

290
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:37,540
Consumers have not really had an opportunity on any reasonable marketed scale, um,

291
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:43,540
you know, to show that they will pay from music and, and, and, and respect rights of authors,

292
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:50,540
um, within, you know, some kind of boundaries that will make it work for everybody.

293
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,540
Uh, so that's the big risk right there.

294
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,540
But I, I have just a belief in humanity.

295
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:01,540
So, you know, I'm, I'm just feeling good about the fact that that'll work.

296
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:06,540
Now, look at where artists are today.

297
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:17,540
Um, you don't need a record label, a record company, because you can get all the pieces that a record label

298
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,540
offers independently and, and it's available out there.

299
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,540
Okay?

300
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:29,540
So let's say, in a traditional recording contract, you get, um, financing of the recording of your album.

301
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,540
Well, you know, everybody can use garage band.

302
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,540
And that stuff's been leveled out.

303
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,540
Okay?

304
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,540
Now distribution, distribution is obviously the piece that, um,

305
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:45,540
iTunes has done a great job at enabling people to purchase individual tracks.

306
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:51,540
Uh, of course, um, there's, uh, there's a few issues with iTunes.

307
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,540
One is you can't really go as an independent artist just to list a track.

308
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,540
You have to go through what they call an aggregator.

309
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,540
CD Baby would be an example of that.

310
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,540
And it takes a long time.

311
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,540
You know, you can't really just say, I want to sell something today right now.

312
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:09,540
It can take a couple weeks, which makes it very hard to implement your marketing plan.

313
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:14,540
Um, so record companies spend a lot of money on marketing and paying radio stations.

314
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,540
Uh, or paying radio stations to keep them friendly.

315
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,540
So they will, uh, then don't really pay for play.

316
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,540
But there's all kinds of money transactions going back and forth.

317
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,540
Um, so, but, you know, they work it.

318
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,540
They have independent promoters.

319
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,540
These guys go out and work it and get the record played and the record played.

320
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,540
Reports the billboard and then billboard, uh,

321
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,540
shows chart activity and then you might get an article.

322
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,540
And then if there's enough budget, they'll do a video clip.

323
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,540
And you get that on MTV and body, body, body, body, body.

324
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,540
That's how the whole thing goes.

325
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,540
So in our world, which is completely separate, but has an amazing amount of distribution.

326
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:51,540
We have podcasters who through the pod safe music network can play the songs.

327
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:56,540
Now, if we have a thousand podcasts with a thousand listeners,

328
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:01,540
playing one song that's a million impressions, a million spins.

329
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:06,540
That's the equivalent of having a huge radio air play in traditional radio.

330
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,540
So if you have a million people, I can only presume that what?

331
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,540
Maybe 1% will show up and buy.

332
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,540
Now, with 99 cents, you're talking about some serious rent money,

333
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,540
beer money, whatever you want.

334
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:25,540
So how does that piece kind of flow from a podcaster playing it?

335
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,540
Podcaster plays a song says, hey, like today I played was a valley lodge hanging on.

336
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,540
Go to my show notes if you like the song.

337
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,540
And there will be a link.

338
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,540
And you click on the link and you'll go into the artist's page.

339
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,540
It's very much like it happens right now.

340
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,540
You can go to my show notes and see it at any time.

341
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,540
It takes you straight to the artist's page.

342
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,540
But then there will be a by-link.

343
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:49,540
And the by-link right now, we are doing worldwide credit cards.

344
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,540
So anywhere you are, you'll be able to register.

345
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,540
And you only have to enter your card details once.

346
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,540
You know, it's like a real store.

347
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,540
And we have a partner for that who does it all secure.

348
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,540
You know, we don't want to be a credit card transaction company.

349
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:06,540
We want your details to be completely safe, obviously.

350
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,540
Then you are shuddled back after you've purchased.

351
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,540
You come back to, we don't really have a name for you.

352
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,540
But I guess you're your collection or whatever.

353
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,540
You'll have a little bit of space or not a little bit of space.

354
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,540
You'll have an area within your account on the pod save music network.

355
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,540
Oh yeah, listeners will have an account now, of course.

356
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,540
And everything you purchase will be in there.

357
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,540
And it'll just stay in there, okay?

358
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:35,540
So it's not like iTunes where if you lose the file, you can't get it back.

359
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,540
No, it's there.

360
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,540
And you can just go back and download it again.

361
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,540
Now, of course, you should be able to load it on any device.

362
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,540
And it played anywhere you want.

363
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,540
But we want to encourage people if they turn other people onto the music

364
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,540
to get their friends to buy a copy as well.

365
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:56,540
Now that piece going from the show notes into the purchase system,

366
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,540
we feel that that is an important part of the unlabel.

367
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:06,540
And that podcasters should be able to participate in sending someone over there to buy.

368
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:15,540
So we're going to make it so that they become a part of the marketing program of that song or that artist.

369
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,540
And that they get a piece of the transaction.

370
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:21,540
Now, of course, we'll make it so that you can put a link and you don't have to be a podcaster.

371
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,540
If you just want to promote someone, you could basically have your own little mini record label.

372
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:30,540
By promoting all the songs that you want and being able to point right into the store.

373
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:34,540
And just like any other affiliate program,

374
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:41,540
only I think you'll see that we have some benefit and we'll be working very closely with the independent promoters of music,

375
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,540
whether the podcasters or listeners.

376
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,540
And then the circle is complete.

377
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,540
You know, what else do you need?

378
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,540
Is there anything else that a traditional record company can bring to the table?

379
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,540
I don't think so.

380
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,540
Oh, shoot.

381
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:05,540
I'm glad I got most of that out because it was important that the folks on the satellite hear about that because we got some cool stuff happening here in podcasting.

382
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:16,540
And actually, I'm coming to New York on the, was it the week of the 12th going to be dropping by a serious HQ and going to be talking to the big way.

383
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:23,540
Actually, Scott Greenstein, major big way about what we can do with pod safe music on serious satellite.

384
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:31,540
Anyway, serious listeners have a great weekend. I will catch you guys on Monday.

385
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,540
So we here on the podcast can just to happily continue.

386
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:39,540
Okay, so do you understand why I'm really excited about this?

387
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,540
Because I can't see any other piece.

388
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:52,540
Well, yeah, I mean, the only thing you could argue is that record companies have a and our guys and a people who hook up musicians with producers and writers and videographers.

389
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,540
Hey, guess what?

390
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,540
That's called the social network.

391
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:00,540
You know, we're going to be building that so that we can also facilitate within the network.

392
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,540
People who are writers who want to hook up with musicians.

393
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,540
Look what we did with pod safe for peace for Christ's sake.

394
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,540
It was just an idea.

395
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,540
Within two weeks, we had 32 artists all together doing a song.

396
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:17,540
And, and selling it with the proceeds going to UNICEF.

397
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,540
Okay.

398
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:27,540
So anyway, because we won't actually do the final testing of every single piece of the track.

399
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:35,540
You know, we want to make sure that the transaction part is really, you know, that we have all the security down for that.

400
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,540
It's going to have to wait until Monday.

401
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:42,540
I know you may bummed out and you wanted to try it.

402
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,540
We'll, we'll basically have that, I think by Monday we'll have it up and running.

403
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:54,540
I just, you know, it's, it's, but it's all going to be baited stuff anyway and we're really, you know, testing it out with the amongst ourselves here.

404
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:59,540
So it'll only be, you know, like maybe one song you can test it out on just to get your account up and up and rolling.

405
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:07,540
And then, of course, it'll be up to the artist to select which tracks they want us to, they don't have to sell, by the way, to select which tracks they want to sell.

406
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,540
We'll test that part out amongst ourselves.

407
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:18,540
And while we're doing that, we'll get this, the unlabeled pieces in place so that people can start promoting music and we can all participate in this.

408
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:24,540
And I, for one, really looking forward to getting it all together.

409
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:36,540
So apologize, you know, a little bit of a delay, but give me a little, a little time to get home and have sex.

410
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:50,540
That's not right. That's really funky. How did that happen?

411
00:26:50,540 --> 00:27:05,540
I was like, wait a minute, this is not the promo.

412
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:13,540
What was thinking it was? Wow. I'm using cast blaster, which you probably know, but that's really weird.

413
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:21,540
Someone, I was trying to play one of the cart things and for some reason, the hanging on kicked in again.

414
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:30,540
Let me see if it works now. There we go.

415
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:46,540
Hey, this is KFC from the pod chick show and we're in the big time. We're in the big time. Hey Adam, thank you so much for all of your help over the past few months getting into podcasting and being so pod father Lee.

416
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:51,540
I really appreciate it. And wow, look at how far we have all come.

417
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:59,540
What an amazing, amazing ride we're having. And I'm so looking forward to riding some more as a member of the pod show family.

418
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:09,540
Thank so much for having me. I'm so, so glad to be part of this new venture and this new industry. We're changing the world, man. We sure are.

419
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:15,540
For those of you who don't know, I am the pod chick and our whole theme is positive vibe podcasting.

422
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:34,540
Check out our videos too. We've got some skydiving and some hot chicks dancing. You know, regular stuff like that.

423
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:41,540
So with that, I look forward to working with everybody from the pod show and I'm just so happy that things are working out the way they are.

424
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:50,540
And wow, happy 2006. What a way to start it off. Hey, like we say on the pod chick show, make them smile.

425
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:57,540
Dan poets. All right, what up, Jay Mack?

426
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:02,540
I see you. What up, Detroit? George, what up, Phoenix?

427
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,540
Come on, this area. Stand the fuck out. Let's go.

428
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,540
Let's go. Listen.

429
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,540
It's good.

430
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,540
Hi.

431
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,540
Dot. Come.

432
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,540
It's all good.

433
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,540
Hi.

434
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,540
We drop off. They call me the pod.

435
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,540
What my aliens make a joy. I hail from that sun.

436
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,540
Same solar. Just hold now. We got that source called updated.

437
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,540
And we're going to give it to you on the daily. Passing our hurry.

438
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,540
I can't wait for them to blame me. You're all serious that light.

439
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,540
It's a strong hype. And I'm a serious man with lights.

440
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,540
Dan poets till I die. Keep your head lower. You're not rocking with the best.

441
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,540
But you already know it. Transform and courtesy in the major.

442
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,540
To be all about courtesy and getting this paper.

443
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,540
All start currently. I take a terrible fellow freaks in that nature.

444
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,540
Disaster. It's like a trainer. Hip hop scene. Yeah, I got that never last blow.

445
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,540
So call me now related. Fuck the haters.

446
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,540
The hate lanes and you can stop hating me.

447
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,540
Picture me on your favorite countdown. I'm out now.

448
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,540
Top one two three. I'll hit and take that spot now.

449
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,540
Where you can jot down the digits for a no-to-be specific.

450
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,540
And I'll add to nature if you want to come get it. You're the best.

451
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,540
How do you say that? I'm serious with my fuck.

452
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,540
The bag is an ex-girl. They kill me as a bar.

453
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,540
I have the industry for the style.

454
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,540
They take the chapels. They like dice. We strap pipes.

455
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,540
And take it in the ass. Well, me, boys, you're me.

456
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,540
Just keep keeping the cash well.

457
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,540
It ain't hard to tell.

458
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,540
Yeah. I love the hood high promos.

459
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:43,540
I sent that one over to the execs. It's serious too.

460
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,540
Got to hear this. It's like an awesome fantastic.

461
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:52,540
You might hear my T-Cettle in the background there.

462
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,540
Yeah. What was it going to say?

463
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:59,540
Oh, pod chick. Yeah. So pod chick welcoming her to the families.

464
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:03,540
So what we're doing with all these people who are joining the network.

465
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:08,540
They are going to actually be beta testers at the same time as they're joining the network.

466
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,540
They're going to help us work on the new systems.

467
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,540
The pod cast delivery network.

468
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,540
You know, this is not something that you just open up and say,

469
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,540
Here it is. Come on in. It's fantastic.

470
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:23,540
You know, I'm really, really careful about that because we're talking about

471
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:27,540
Lots of people who are, you know, very serious about pod casting.

472
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,540
We don't want feed, screwed up, and stuff like that.

473
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,540
I mean, and shit happens, right?

474
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,540
You know, software sucks sometimes and just shit breaks.

475
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:39,540
And it just happens. So we got to be careful when we do this.

476
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,540
So the first people that are coming in,

477
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:46,540
We, you know, who've been diligently working with on the,

478
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:51,540
They've actually helped us, you know, create our agreements.

479
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:57,540
You know, really been able to refine the offering that we have for pod casters.

480
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,540
And then not only going to be using the pod cast,

481
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:03,540
Liberty network interface interfaces, I might say,

482
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:10,540
But also the, the listener portion.

483
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:17,540
And this is the stuff, of course, that we're going to use to lure in our hundreds of millions of listeners.

484
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,540
And so, you know, based upon their feedback,

485
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,540
And that'll take, you know, a couple of feedback loops,

486
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,540
And we'll open it up to more, and then eventually we'll open it up to everybody.

487
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:34,540
Yeah, I was, you know, I was saying that it was like 15 million things went through my head.

488
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,540
And I can't remember what they were.

489
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,540
Oh, yes, okay.

490
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,540
Let me see what's this.

491
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,540
I have so many, you know, I have like seven more things I want to talk about.

492
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,540
So I hope you're in the mood for it because it is Friday.

493
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,540
We're off the side like the windows closed.

494
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,540
Let's just continue on and just do this whole thing.

495
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,540
But first, these words from one of our sponsors.

496
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,540
Do you believe anything is possible?

497
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,540
We do.

498
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,540

We revolve around you.

508
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,540
Okay, okay.

509
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:31,540
That gave me just enough time to grab the tea, slap in a tea bag.

510
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,540
Oh, I can't wait for some sale when I get something.

511
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,540
Some sense, some sense, some sense sale when I get back home.

512
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,540
Let me tell you.

513
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,540
So I've been using cast blaster.

514
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:45,540
And I think I've gotten a much better, a much better sound together.

515
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,540
In fact, let me just see some feedback here.

516
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:53,540
It was actually pretty funny from podcast crew budget.

517
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,540
I thought you were supposed to be the best of the best, the pod father.

518
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,540
So what's the deal with your shitty sound production?

519
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,540
Every time I listen to your show, your pod safe music, skips and pops.

520
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,540
Are you going to blame that on your piece of crap?

521
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,540
Mac too?

522
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,540
Interesting thing, Adam, is that your show is not live.

523
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:10,540
Did you know that means you can give it a listen and fix somebody's things

524
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,540
before sending it out?

525
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,540
Yeah, that would make me like mainstream, dude.

526
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,540
So I guess Jack asks, oh, I'm sorry.

527
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,540
Podcast crew budget, who calls me a jackass,

528
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,540
hasn't heard the cast blaster shows yet.

529
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,540
We've gotten it down much better.

530
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,540
I really liked yesterday's show.

531
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,540
I thought the sound was pretty good.

532
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,540
Now that turned off the internal limit, or it's still working on it a bit.

533
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:33,540
I did actually, I got a note from Mark Yoshimoto Nemkov from Pacifico's Hellway.

534
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,540
He says, dude, I'm curious.

535
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,540
What EQ and compression are you using on your voice?

536
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:43,540
It sounds really fucking good, especially the last couple of days since you migrated to cast blaster.

537
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,540
Yeah, I don't know, Mark.

538
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,540
That's the secret of the Big Hared Fag, man.

539
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,540
You know, I can't go telling you all that.

540
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:54,540
Because, you know, then you'll be a big Hared Fag like me, too.

541
00:34:54,540 --> 00:35:03,540
I got a, you know, I had asked, or I just been kind of talking about some of the stuff that I was experiencing with, with cast blaster.

542
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:09,540
And, well, you know, there is a community for this, this is a wonderful program.

543
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,540
Oh, shoot, I remember I was going to say before.

544
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,540
Let me just write it down so I don't forget.

545
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,540
Sorry.

546
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,540
I forgot again, no hold on.

547
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,540
I'm so fried.

548
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,540
Okay, let me just write that down.

549
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:28,540
There's quite a cast blaster community that you can find at castblaster.com.

550
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:34,540
And the community is taking note of my, of my recent switch.

551
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,540
And here's some feedback.

552
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:43,540
Hey, Adam, this is Barry J, cast blaster form moderator over castblaster.com.

553
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:50,540
Hey, the other day on DSC 317, you were complaining about the card buttons on cast blaster.

554
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,540
And the fact they don't have countdown clocks.

555
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,540
Well, that's true.

556
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,540
They don't have countdown clocks.

557
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,540
But they do have progress bars.

558
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,540
Is that little thin line under each button.

559
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,540
So when you press a button like this.

560
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,540
I'm asking for a new Hampshire.

561
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,540
This is Radio QRM.

562
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:13,540
The progress bar actually turns green as your promo or bumper plays.

563
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,540
Okay, now it's time for the shameless plug.

564
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,540
I now have a podcast.

565
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,540
It's called Radio QRM.

566
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:26,540
It's a weekly mix of pod safe music from where else the pod safe music network.

567
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,540
And it sounds something like this.

568
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,540
Yeah.

569
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,540
Right on Barry.

570
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,540
So, you know, it's funny because.

571
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,540
Oh, I'm sorry.

572
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,540
This is Radio QRM.

573
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:01,540
So I was listening to that comment earlier today at the office.

574
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,540
I'm like holy crap.

575
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,540
They're actually our progress.

576
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:10,540
They're great progress bars and countdown timers under the track players in the cast blaster.

577
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,540
But I hadn't seen.

578
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,540
It's funny.

579
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,540
The progress bars underneath the cart buttons.

580
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,540
And the reason why is because the angle, you know,

581
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:23,540
this thing is on the on the countertop and the open kitchen thing here in the condo.

582
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,540
And I'm significantly taller.

583
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,540
It's really just too low for what I'm doing.

584
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:34,540
So the angle that I'm looking at the laptop screen doesn't actually.

585
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,540
Translate all of what's going on the screen.

586
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,540
And when I got really close, see if I go down here, I can see it.

587
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,540
I'm straight looking straight into the screen.

588
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,540
But of course, I can't see the mic.

589
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,540
Indeed, there's a progress bar there.

590
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,540
Holy crap.

591
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:51,540
A lot of that stuff that I was, and by the way, I don't think I was complaining.

592
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,540
It's called feedback.

593
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,540
You know, complaining is, I'm, I'm a lady, man.

594
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,540
This is great.

595
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,540
You know, I'm no fan of windows.

596
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,540
But hey, look, I can use unique some machines.

597
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,540
I can use dust machines.

598
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,540
I can use max.

599
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:11,540
I can, you know, I could probably still do some peek and poke shit on the,

600
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,540
the Vic Commodore Vic 20 and the Sinclair ZXA to you name it.

601
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,540
You know, as I can work with windows, it may not be my favorite machine to,

602
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,540
you know, to manage my life with.

603
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,540
But, you know, hey, that's not what I got it for.

604
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,540
I got this thing just to sit here and do its job.

605
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:29,540
You know, the extra sound card and next Wednesday, I believe,

606
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,540
Kenster J and I are going to do another MTV chronicle.

607
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:37,540
So I get to try out my Skype theory with the dual sound cards.

608
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,540
So we can really, you know, see, we can get some good recording going on

609
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,540
and set it up the way I think it should work.

610
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,540
So, you know, it's, it's cool.

611
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,540
No complaints whatsoever.

612
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,540
Amigo.

613
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,540
No complaints whatsoever.

614
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,540
Okay, here's, this is not a complaint, okay.

615
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:01,540
But, what I was used to on the Mac is I was able to,

616
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,540
take any document that quick time can play.

617
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:08,540
And I could basically play that in Megaseg and I just discovered,

618
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:12,540
I wanted to play an MP4, which is a video.

619
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,540
Excuse me, a video.

620
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:18,540
It's really the, it's kind of, it's an open standard,

621
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,540
but that's now kind of known as the iPod format for iPod video.

622
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,540
Because an old colleague of mine, Bill Elberg,

623
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:28,540
better known as Vladi, the Mad Russian scientist, a different one,

624
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:32,540
then I spoke, you know, that this is not George, this is Vladi,

625
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,540
and Vladimir.

626
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:38,540
Bill Elberg, who used to work with us in the early days of

627
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,540
thinking my idea, it's actually on ramp before that.

628
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,540
He was fucking great.

629
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:47,540
And he's in LA and he's working at, I don't know if he wants me to tell you

630
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,540
where he's working, but he has a great, a great gig,

631
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,540
and I'm really proud of the success of all these guys

632
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,540
that used to work in our, in our previous companies,

633
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,540
you know, him and Brad's certainly.

634
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:02,540
Actually, I mean, there's 700 people, so I could keep on name and names.

635
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:06,540
But I knew I've played Miss Prince with the Z at the end

636
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:10,540
on the daily source code quite a bit, and he told me this

637
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,540
before, after I had already played Miss Prince,

638
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,540
and I guess I kind of forgot, but I, you know,

639
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,540
that's his band, and he's in it.

640
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:26,540
And he gave me a video to one of their songs.

641
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,540
And so that won't play in the cast blast,

642
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,540
which I guess is kind of default behavior,

643
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,540
so it's not a bug or anything.

644
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,540
But I just can't play right now,

645
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,540
it would take me, you know, to have to pause the recording

646
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,540
to go and get it.

647
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:43,540
So you'll have to hold on to hearing the Miss Prince

648
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,540
and on Monday when I'm back, then we'll put a link

649
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,540
into the video, but in the meantime,

650
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,540
you can always check out the podcast,

651
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,540
Music Network, and it's good to hear from Bill.

652
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:57,540
Dude, I can't believe that's you, Bill.

653
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,540
Let's just put it down.

654
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,540
Yeah, I won't take it right on the list.

655
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,540
Woohoo!

656
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,540
Oh, yeah, there it is.

657
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,540
Brad with Adam, it's a really big deal.

658
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,540
Brad with Adam, it's a really big deal.

659
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,540
Brad with Adam, it's a really big deal.

660
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,540
Cook it slow, cook it fast, we'll have the United.

661
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,540
Just jump on board and take it on night.

662
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:18,540
We're going out on the test drive.

663
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,540
It comes rockin' right.

664
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,540
It comes rockin' right.

665
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,540
It comes rockin' right.

666
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,540
It comes rockin' right.

667
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,540
It comes rockin' right.

668
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,540
We're going out on the test drive.

669
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,540
It comes rockin' right.

670
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,540
It comes rockin' right.

671
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,540
It comes rockin' right.

672
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,540
It comes rockin' right.

673
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,540
It comes rockin' right.

674
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,540
Let's move it on.

675
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,540
Let's move it on.

676
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,540
Let's move it on.

677
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,540
Let's move it on.

678
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,540
Let's move it on.

679
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,540
Let's move it on.

680
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,540
Let's move it on.

681
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,540
Let's move it on.

682
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,540
Let's move it on.

683
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,540
That's right.

684
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,540
We're going on a test drive.

685
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,540
Today, Ron and I have a meeting at Google and we're taking Trinity.

686
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,540
Yeah, baby.

687
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,540
We are taking our science experiment on the road.

688
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,540
So that's going to be a lot of fun.

689
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,540
It's actually going to be great.

690
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,540
We're meeting with a whole bunch of interesting people.

691
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:08,540
Remember I talked about the music search.

692
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:14,540
So that's one of the main reasons we're there is to talk about including pot-safe music.

693
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,540
Pot-safe music network in the music search.

694
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:22,540
We're also meeting with the guys from Google Reader, Google Talk.

695
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,540
Guys and gals, I should say actually.

696
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,540
It's going to be fun.

697
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,540
It's more fun that we're taking Trinity.

698
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,540
I hope she makes it.

699
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,540
It'll be great karma if she does.

700
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,540
Speaking of Google, I'm not really speaking of Google.

701
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:42,540
I always think of a big hotbed of software developers.

702
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:46,540
I don't know if it's open for business.

703
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,540
I think it should be.

704
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,540
I didn't actually synchronize with Andrew before the end of the day.

705
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,540
Now that I think of it.

706
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:59,540
But as a part of our, you know, getting into beta and soon launching my pot-show.

707
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,540
Pot-safe music, the podcast delivery network and pot-show plus.

708
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,540
Oh, there's a new one for you.

709
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,540
Pot-show plus.

710
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:12,540
We are launching our developers program.

711
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:17,540
And you can find that at developers.pot-show.com because

712
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,540
And I'm really proud of this.

713
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,540
I think this is so cool.

714
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,540
And this of course is one of the main reasons why we have Andrew.

715
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:29,540
Andrew comes with a lot of cool, cool little tricks in his tool bag.

716
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:34,540
But he very successfully ran the,

717
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:39,540
the iPod 11, the juice receiver, open source project,

718
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:43,540
collaborative amongst like three or four continents, you know.

719
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,540
So he'll be, he's been setting this up.

720
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,540
And, and so you go to developers.pot-show.com.

721
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,540
Everything will be open.

722
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,540
Everything will be all API is open.

723
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:58,540
All the inputs and outputs of this puppy are all going

724
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:03,540
to be available through APIs that you're probably already familiar with.

725
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:08,540
But, you know, there's modules and stuff to do and check that out.

726
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:12,540
Developers.pot.jout.com and I'll see you over there

727
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,540
because I like to lure out that shit.

728
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:18,540
I love hanging out with the geeks once in a while, you know.

729
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:22,540
Hey, since it's Friday, not only do I have a, by the way,

730
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:27,540
Jeffrey Smith dude for doing all these, all this music and all these songs and stuff.

731
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,540
You, you just rule so incredibly major.

732
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,540
He did a re-edit of the Roger Smalls intro.

733
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:49,540
And, of course, we have a message from Roger Smalls.

734
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,540
Hello, my name, Roger here.

735
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:53,540
Quick question for your mental sexual section.

736
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:57,540
I was wondering if you had any tips for shaving walls without any bleeding.

737
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:02,540
I'm sure that it's for his light Robert Teneerow or Victoria Backabilition in right now.

738
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,540
Thank you for sharing the advice too.

739
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,540
Thank you.

740
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:19,540
Yeah, what you've got to do is another message from Roger Smalls.

741
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:22,540
So I heard that from Roger.

742
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,540
And I didn't get it at first.

743
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,540
I didn't.

744
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:29,540
And I'm not only if he's trying to be funny or this is, or if he really meant this,

745
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,540
but I was like, Victoria Backim doesn't have warps on her face,

746
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,540
like Robert Orp.

747
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,540
I don't think Robert Teneerow is a ways of mole on his face.

748
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,540
And then I figured out what I think he was trying to say.

749
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,540
You're disgusting, Roger.

750
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,540
Man.

751
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:46,540
But you do get my weekend off to a good start with that stuff.

752
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,540
You're nuts.

753
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,540
Let me see.

754
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,540
Oh, wow, yes.

755
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:57,540
So the news about this week in tech,

756
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:04,540
that I noticed quit taking advertising through pod track.

757
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:07,540
So I said that I was really excited about this.

758
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:10,540
And it was so hard to believe because Leo Leport has been,

759
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:14,540
you know, so clear in the past about, you know,

760
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,540
staying non-commercial.

761
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:20,540
He made, why did it deal with AOL for the bandwidth,

762
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,540
which I understand?

763
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,540
And I thought that was, you know, that's actually a pretty pretty damn good deal,

764
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,540
because bandwidth, particularly the numbers these guys are doing.

765
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:32,540
You know, that's, I can get pretty costly.

766
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,540
But he, you know, his keynote at the portable media expo.

767
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:39,540
He, you know, was all about passion and not about taking money

768
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,540
because then, you know, it would be, I mean,

769
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,540
you go, look, look at his keynote.

770
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,540
I don't want to put any words in his mouth.

771
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,540
And so it showed up in CBS Marketwatch.

772
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:51,540
And as I told you, I even pinged Frank Barnock on said,

773
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,540
do, did you check this?

774
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:55,540
And so, of course, I know Leo.

775
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:59,540
I fired off an email to Leo, and it's true.

776
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,540
He's taken ads.

777
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:01,540
He's there.

778
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,540
They're in some kind of auction or something.

779
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,540
And we'll have to see how that works exactly.

780
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:08,540
But that is phenomenal.

781
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:15,540
And I'm very, very, very, very happy for everybody, really,

782
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:19,540
for us as such a validation, you know, of that.

783
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,540
Because I don't think this show is going to change.

784
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,540
So they'll have a sponsor.

785
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,540
Who cares?

786
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:27,540
You know, it's great, you know.

787
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:32,540
And, you know, if it'll keep TWIT going, you know,

788
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:36,540
I'm quite, there's a whole thread over it to TWIT.tv.

789
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,540
You can read about, I guess he was already kind of preparing the audience

790
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,540
by asking questions, you know, should we do like an MPR model,

791
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:45,540
listen or supported model, and looks like he went,

792
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,540
I don't know if it's a hybrid that he's going to do

793
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:48,540
a full ads, whatever.

794
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:52,540
But it is a validation of, you know,

795
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:57,540
great content, professional content that can match up with advertisers

796
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:01,540
who are willing to step into the medium and make it work.

797
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:04,540
You know, money has to flow somehow.

798
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:08,540
And I think that we all can work with this.

799
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:11,540
You know, look at what's happening in the world.

800
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:16,540
Media is changing right before a very freaking eyes.

801
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,540
And ears.

802
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:23,540
So, you know, if you remove the concept of time immedia,

803
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:27,540
you know, it doesn't matter how long or how short something is.

804
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:32,540
If you remove the concept of limited frequency and ether,

805
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:37,540
then it only makes sense that you can't do the same type of advertising.

806
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:40,540
Now that doesn't mean that we have the answer yet,

807
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,540
and that we know exactly what it's supposed to be.

808
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:44,540
But it's happening.

809
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,540
It really is taking place.

810
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,540
And any advertiser,

811
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:53,540
whether, you know, however they're working with us and with other ad networks

812
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,540
or whatever system or any podcast,

813
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:00,540
thank you for doing it because we're going to figure this stuff out.

814
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,540
And by the way, listeners,

815
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,540
thank you so much for bringing your feedback in.

816
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:08,540
Because if you think that feedback doesn't go straight back to advertising agencies

817
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:14,540
and the companies themselves who are utilizing podcasts to advertise,

818
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,540
I mean, of course that's what's going on.

819
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,540
So it can only get better.

820
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:20,540
So your feedback is incredibly important.

821
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:24,540
It is incredibly important.

822
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,540
That said, here's another great example.

823
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,540
Hold on a second.

824
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:32,540
Remember, I went to the Johnson and Johnson conference.

825
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:37,540
It was all the brand managers and media buyers in Seattle.

826
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,540
I actually did a show from there.

827
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,540
Well,

828
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:44,540
I'll give you, which is a Johnson Johnson brand,

829
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:45,540
which I know very well by the way.

830
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,540
I've been an IQ view user all my life.

831
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:51,540
I stopped using contact lenses.

832
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:52,540
Let me see.

833
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,540
Actually, when I started flying,

834
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:58,540
because it was the night flight, I think.

835
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,540
I was doing some night flying.

836
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:06,540
And I put my glasses on instead of my contacts.

837
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:09,540
And I really noticed a difference.

838
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,540
And I don't know if that was just a night stuff specifically or whatever.

839
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,540
And then I kind of got into,

840
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,540
well, I got into the pink glasses that I wore.

841
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,540
So I just wore prescription glasses.

842
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,540
I had these rose colored glasses, which was really nice for a while.

843
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,540
And then I have,

844
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,540
these actually had a blue tint when I first got them.

845
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,540
I don't kind of rubbed off.

846
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,540
And I just got into glasses for a while.

847
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,540
But I've always used active view.

848
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,540
Yeah, active view colored lenses, which is pretty trippy.

849
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:40,540
So I like the company regardless of whether they're,

850
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:43,540
whether they're sponsoring the podcast,

851
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,540
the podgeo podcast network or neat or neat.

852
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,540
This is my Dutch slipping, or not.

853
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,540
But they are.

854
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:52,540
Specifically what they're doing is there's this,

855
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:55,540
they're actually underwriting an entire podcast.

856
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:58,540
So it's, I think I've mentioned them before.

857
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:00,540
Heather and Janelle,

858
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,540
two high school girls, high school girls,

859
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,540
trying to get an audience basically.

860
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:10,540
And, and they're just talking,

861
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:13,540
you know, talking like high school girls.

862
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,540
And the reason why,

863
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,540
and I can certainly mention that on this podcast,

864
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:23,540
is high school girls are interested in contact lenses.

865
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:27,540
Because that's a big decision you make, you know,

866
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:29,540
when you're young.

867
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,540
We used to do,

868
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,540
one of our clients when we were,

869
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,540
when we had thing new ideas was,

870
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:39,540
excuse me, I got something about it.

871
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:43,540
I'm like, so I'm slipped in my throat there.

872
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,540
I won't even tell you that story.

873
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,540
I'll tell you that story another time.

874
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:50,540
Anyway, you can check out Heather and Janelle

875
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,540
at download.acview.com.

876
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:57,540
Acview is AC, women, let me do that probably.

877
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:01,540
I'll for Charlie Uniform, Victor Uniform Echo.com.

878
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,540
There you go.

879
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,540
Okay, let me just wind this up with one thing.

880
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:13,540
I actually, I really contemplated not playing this

881
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:17,540
because I, here's what I did internally.

882
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,540
This, this audio feedback is particularly in this show

883
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:23,540
because I was, I'm talking, because I've already talked about them.

884
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:28,540
But I afforded this to a number of people within Pod Show,

885
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:31,540
not as a, as a,

886
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:35,540
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's definitely work and not like that.

887
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:39,540
But to reiterate how incredibly important it is

888
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:43,540
when you come out with any type of service

889
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:46,540
or offering for people who are serious about podcasting,

890
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:50,540
how carefully you have to be with this stuff.

891
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:54,540
Because one glitch can really ruin your day.

892
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,540
Now, this is from the financial aid podcast.

893
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,540
And it's about pod track.

894
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,540
And I just want you to listen.

895
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,540
And again, this is not, you know,

896
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,540
sticking the tongue out at anybody.

897
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:10,540
But it is important to understand what can happen

898
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:15,540
when you start integrating pieces of your profession

899
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:18,540
with other parties and how careful we all have to be.

900
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,540
And this is, this could go for feed burner.

901
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:24,540
This could go for any other company including pod show.

902
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:27,540
So this is really just something for podcasters.

903
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:31,540
I want you to understand what can happen when things go wrong

904
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:36,540
when you basically give up control of your feed.

905
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,540
Hey, I don't, this is Christian, the financial aid podcast

906
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:41,540
with some feedback for you on pod track.

907
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:44,540
As mentioned at DSC319, I noticed in mid December

908
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:47,540
that one of my fellow New England podcasters was using pod track

909
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,540
as a means of tracking their traffic

910
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,540
and their listenership more accurately.

911
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,540
I looked at the website and it seemed like they had

912
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:55,540
a pretty promising offering so I signed up for it.

913
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,540
Now, I'm not so terribly upset about the fact that

914
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,540
in the month I've been a pod track member.

915
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:03,540
I've never once gotten a report about my listenership statistics at all.

916
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,540
No, as I terribly bothered by the fact that

917
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,540
customer service kept replying with it.

918
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,540
Oh, we'll get a report to you any day now.

919
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,540
No, what bothered me was this morning.

920
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,540
I went to the website, the pod track website.

921
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:16,540
And I wanted to see if the reports that had been promised

922
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:17,540
for so long were available.

923
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:19,540
And instead, I got a server application error.

924
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,540
Hey, no big deal.

925
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:22,540
I figured I would just get out of my day and check back later.

926
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:25,540
So I recorded the financial aid podcast as usual every morning.

927
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:28,540
Got it up to the server and got it out there.

928
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,540
iTunes was showing the dreaded exclamation point next to the feed.

929
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:34,540
And I was like, oh, what's going on here?

930
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:37,540
So I went to my web server and I made sure the file was there

931
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,540
and they had not done a pre-coffie move and named

932
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,540
something I shouldn't have.

933
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:42,540
And everything was fine.

934
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:45,540
Well, it turns out the way pod track works

935
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:50,540
is basically they have your pre-pend there URL to all of the episodes of your podcast.

936
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:54,540
So whether it's the MP3 posted directly on a website like my space or

937
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:57,540
whether it's in your RSS feed, you always have a pod track URL

938
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,540
at the beginning of your MP3 references.

939
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:01,540
No matter where you are.

940
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:05,540
And here's the part that annoys me this morning from 6 to 9AM,

941
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:08,540
which is when the peak listenership of the financial aid podcast is

942
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:09,540
because that's when the show is released.

943
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,540
And that's when people tend to get to work.

944
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,540
Pod track was completely unavailable.

945
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:16,540
And when they're down, all of your MP3s are down too.

946
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:19,540
There's no way for your users to get to your show.

947
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:22,540
I don't know what podjo has waiting in the wings for podcasters around the world

948
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:25,540
in terms of measuring listenership and things like that.

949
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:28,540
But please, please, please, please, no matter what you do,

950
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:29,540
make it reliable.

951
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:32,540
Have backups, have redundancy, have fail over everything

952
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:35,540
because there's nothing more frustrating to me as podcaster

953
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,540
than not having my podcaster available to the world.

954
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:40,540
As for pod track and the form emails I've gotten

955
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:43,540
from CEO Mark McRearify his assistant,

956
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,540
I will never, ever, ever use pod track again.

957
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:50,540
And for any other podcasters out there who are considering using pod track,

958
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:53,540
make sure they've got their reliability problems under control

959
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:54,540
before you switch over.

960
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:57,540
Anyway, this is a bit of angry audio feedback from Chris

961
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,540
from the financial aid podcast.

962
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:02,540
Have a great day at him and I hope podshow does a much better job.

963
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:03,540
Okay.

964
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,540
So, the most important message here,

965
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,540
you heard what he said at the end,

966
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:09,540
make sure that you have redundancy, fail over double,

967
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,540
double told lots, et cetera.

968
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:16,540
This is why you have not seen podshow come out with

969
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,540
it's offering very quickly.

970
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:23,540
We really took some time to understand bandwidth.

971
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:26,540
Now, of course, we spend a lot of time looking at

972
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:29,540
solutions like bit torrent or things that big companies

973
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,540
like Microsoft are looking at.

974
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,540
Something that could really scale,

975
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:36,540
but, you know, without everybody buying in

976
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,540
everybody means all the aggregator developers.

977
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:42,540
And I don't think we can count necessarily on

978
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,540
the biggest one, the biggest podcast aggregator

979
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:49,540
iTunes, you know, to necessarily see the benefit

980
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:55,540
to themselves by participating in a bit torrent type of distribution.

981
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:59,540
Mainly because it makes a whole bunch of people in Hollywood

982
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:02,540
really nervous and no one wants to deal with that angst.

983
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:04,540
I understand that, by the way.

984
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:10,540
So we went looking for the best solution for bandwidth

985
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:11,540
and hosting.

986
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:12,540
And we have some experience.

987
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:15,540
I actually had a company called the data barn,

988
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,540
which was interestingly enough,

989
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:18,540
the right idea.

990
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:19,540
We were at a peering point.

991
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,540
We had peering agreements.

992
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:22,540
It was at the wrong time.

993
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:25,540
We had peering agreements with, I don't know, you know,

994
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:29,540
guys that were operated by Enron and companies like that.

995
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:32,540
So it was called the data barn.

996
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:35,540
It was, you know, I understand a lot more about this stuff

997
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:40,540
than, you know, we may have really talked about on this show.

998
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:44,540
So we spent months, literally months,

999
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:47,540
experimenting, testing, working, talking to people.

1000
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:51,540
Now in the valley, you know, what's people used to call

1001
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:53,540
Silicon Valley, what we call valley would.

1002
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:56,540
There's almost like, and the solution you always take is,

1003
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:57,540
oh, let's just go to Akamai.

1004
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,540
Akamai will make it all work.

1005
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,540
But when iTunes came out and when, you know,

1006
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:04,540
the big bandwidth slurp took place,

1007
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:07,540
the bandwidth burp of 2005.

1008
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:10,540
We cut a real quick deal with Akamai.

1009
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:13,540
And I believe that the pricing,

1010
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,540
I'm just going to do this from memory,

1011
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:20,540
but the pricing for a content delivery network.

1012
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:25,540
It's pretty much between one and, you know,

1013
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,540
a buck to a buck 50, I'd say.

1014
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:31,540
The bigger you are, the more bandwidth you eat,

1015
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:37,540
the cheaper the price is going to get.

1016
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,540
What was it going to say?

1017
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:41,540
Okay, so that's, that's per gigabyte,

1018
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:43,540
per gigabyte of data transferred.

1019
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:45,540
And this is what all the, you know,

1020
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:50,540
all the big streaming hogs bandwidth hogs use,

1021
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:54,540
you know, like ABC or CBS or NBC.com

1022
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:56,540
and you look at their videos and stuff.

1023
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,540
And the thing that's really good is that

1024
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,540
the thing that is not used is that

1025
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:02,540
it's not used to use, is it?

1026
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,540
I think, maybe Apple doesn't Apple have a direct investment

1027
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:05,540
in Akamai.

1028
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:08,540
I think they do, or they invest like $100 million or something at some point.

1029
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:12,540
And we were really looking for a company that would fit with us,

1030
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:16,540
would understand kind of the renegade nature of podcasting

1031
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:20,540
of the idea of user generated content.

1032
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:24,540
You know, and really would work with us,

1033
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:28,540
the thing that sucks the most about independent podcasting is,

1034
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:30,540
when something catches on and people start to listen,

1035
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,540
that's when you run into trouble.

1036
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:34,540
And we've seen, you know, I mean, for the stuff that's

1037
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:36,540
no publicly, there's a lot of podcasts

1038
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:39,540
that have really had some major bandwidth issues.

1039
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,540
And it just cost money.

1040
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:44,540
Now, the company that we, so, you know,

1041
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,540
so we decided we needed to go with a content delivery network.

1042
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,540
We really have to because, you know,

1043
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:52,540
just like we're using an outside company to do

1044
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:55,540
the transaction for the pod, safe music network.

1045
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:58,540
You know, let's use some professionals who are doing this stuff all day.

1046
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:02,540
Now, this is podcasting is a little different from streaming media, okay?

1047
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:07,540
You're talking about shipping huge files all around the world,

1048
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:08,540
all around the network.

1049
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:12,540
Instead of passing bits and bytes on on demand basis.

1050
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:17,540
So you want files cached in different geographic locations.

1051
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:19,540
You want this bandwidth done,

1052
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,540
not through thousands of edge servers,

1053
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:23,540
but through peer networks.

1054
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:27,540
I mean, this whole, I mean, I've really made a study of this.

1055
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,540
And, and Ron and I worked,

1056
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,540
I particularly Ron, I have to say,

1057
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:35,540
worked just tirelessly with Bill Reinhardt,

1058
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:37,540
the CEO of Limelight Networks,

1059
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:41,540
to come to a deal that would really work for both of us.

1060
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:43,540
Now, I'm kind of jumping the gun here,

1061
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:44,540
a little bit.

1062
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,540
The pod-pimp is going to, it's going to hate me.

1063
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,540
But I just wanted to let you know

1064
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:53,540
that we have been teaming up with world-class partners.

1065
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:57,540
And please feel free to go over and take a look at,

1066
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,540
you know, what you think your bandwidth would cost

1067
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:01,540
on a content delivery network.

1068
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:05,540
And then know that any podcaster,

1069
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,540
anybody who wants to come into the network

1070
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:10,540
and who wants to work on building the network

1071
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:12,540
and making the network better

1072
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:16,540
and creating fun stuff and having a kick-ass time

1073
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:19,540
with an actual possibility of beside social reward,

1074
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:21,540
having financial reward,

1075
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:24,540
you're going to get the bandwidth

1076
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:26,540
and the hosting all for free.

1077
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:28,540
And I'd like you to go take a look

1078
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:30,540
and see what that would cost if you had to pay

1079
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:32,540
for it out of your own pocket.

1080
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:34,540
So that will be my damn announcement for the week.

1081
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:36,540
Everybody have a fantastic weekend.

1082
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,540
I'll talk to you on Monday

1083
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:40,540
after I'm back and after I've had plenty of sex.

1084
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:41,540
Bye-bye now.

1085
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:44,540
Another pod-show pod guest,

1086
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:46,540
sticking in your ear.
