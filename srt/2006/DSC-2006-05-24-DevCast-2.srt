Everybody welcome to DevCast Number 2.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,880
It's Adam here at the Curry Cottage, just south of London.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,720
And it's good to see that we've got a couple hundred developers, I presume most of

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,000
you are a developer, so we're subscribed to the DevCast.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,640
This podcast will actually contain a golden ticket, so if you receive one and you'll

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,280
know and I'll let you know exactly where that will happen, because you of course may not

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,280
get one.

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,120
But if you two then you're in and we're going to get you up and running and working on

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,960
Pod Show Plus and the podcast that we network ASAP.

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:02,080
On the Skype now from Pod Show HQ and San Francisco, Kevin Ostrowski, known as K-O or K-1,

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,080
how you doing buddy?

15
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,720
Not too bad, how you been?

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,720
We missed you out here.

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,240
I miss you guys too, it's been the longest time we've been a part honey.

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,680
I know we've been growing, there's some people that have even met you.

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,200
I keep seeing the introduction emails, hey, welcome so on, so welcome and I, oh man.

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,760
So yeah, do we have enough seats and chairs and tables left?

21
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,040
We've got one extra desk, but they were all just put in last week, so we're running

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,320
out quicker than we can to get them.

23
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,680
Oh crap, well if you guys need to use my office, you know where it is, just follow the

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,680
smoke trail.

25
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,480
Oh, by the way, happy for 20.

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,560
Yeah, happy for 20 back at you, my friend.

27
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,560
That's right.

28
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,560
It's 420 somewhere in the world.

29
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,360
I did, you know, I'm a complete idiot, it is indeed for, well, by the time this air

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,520
is probably will be 421, but the all developers know that or is it only the developers

31
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,520
who smoke, who understand that?

32
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,840
I think it's a pretty common for the common, so Kevin, why don't you give us a little

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,920
bit of background about yourself, and because I don't think we've really talked about that

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,520
a lot, you know, where you were before Pod Show and why the heck you joined this band

35
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,520
of freaks?

36
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,440
Well, I used to work at a company called Signature Network, which is the leading music

37
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:29,000
merchandising company on the web, core business that I was selling t-shirts, around the

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,080
online side of that developed a fan club system that is used to this day still on youtube.com,

39
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,320
kiss online, we did a site from Adana, Britney Spears, all these pop stars that I don't

40
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
really care for.

41
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,520
Yeah, all your type of music, right?

42
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,000
It's right up your alley.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's all rocking out.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,440
Did you meet any of them?

45
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,440
No.

46
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,120
The only person I met was Sammy Hager, which was actually kind of cool.

47
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,120
He's pretty cool.

48
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
I've met him a couple.

49
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,120
He's a good guy.

50
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,120
Yeah, he seems all right.

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,600
In fact, he was the guy that convinced me I should go work for MTV, I met him over in Holland

52
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,120
and I said, yeah, MTV called me and said, oh dude, you should totally do that, that's right.

53
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,440
And this of course was early 80s, right?

54
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,320
So when MTV was still playing music, it's still cool, so right on.

55
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,080
So you were doing that, how did we find you?

56
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
Did you find us?

57
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
I can't really remember.

58
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,840
Oh, I was recommended by one of my old bosses at Signatures to come on over and work

59
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,760
here and you guys gave me an offer I couldn't refuse here.

60
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,760
Who was that person?

61
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,760
I got to go thank you.

62
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,760
I got to go thank you.

63
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,760
John Bellistery?

64
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,760
I think you know.

65
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,760
Yeah, yeah, of course.

66
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,760
Oh, all right.

67
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,760
No, I don't know.

68
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,760
I don't know.

69
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,760
I understand the connection.

70
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:48,760
It was funny, we had like a Friday celebration, our food bar Friday and it was really cool

71
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,640
because I was dialed in through the eye chat, so I could see what was going on.

72
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,880
And we brought up a picture of the very first, you know, early days when we were right

73
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:06,520
in South Park on when we really had the official podcast, Ali Office, where the homeless

74
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,080
people were pooping in the back in the alley there.

75
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
The good old days.

76
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,720
And you know, when we started out, and I think we, I talked about this on daily source

77
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:22,080
code not too long ago, we really were planning to do something of a much smaller scale

78
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
I think.

79
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,400
Was that your impression when we started?

80
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,440
Yeah, maybe originally we were going to just kind of make podcasts and easier for

81
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,880
podcasts, and it's really been snowballing ever since then.

82
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,400
And so from just, well, just, well, from making something for podcasters and making podcasting

83
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,400
really simple, we've actually turned a lot of our attention towards the audience.

84
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,560
Yeah, we're really gearing stuff up for the listeners themselves, letting people connect

85
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,960
with other people, letting them connect with the podcasters and eventually artists.

86
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,320
So come a long way, the few months.

87
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,640
Now how long have we actually been, because you're really, I would have to say, you

88
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,640
know, the core of all of this development of our social media network and all these, and

89
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,880
really bringing all these pieces together, what have we, how long have we been working

90
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,880
on this now?

91
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,880
Eight nine months.

92
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,880
Uh, back.

93
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,880
That's September.

94
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,880
So, dude.

95
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
Yeah.

96
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,880
Yeah.

97
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,520
So, uh, are we ready to release yet, Kevin?

98
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,520
Okay.

99
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
Can we get this?

100
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,520
I'm ready.

101
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,440
I'm ready to push the button any time I get the okay, so we're getting really closely.

102
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,440
Yeah.

103
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
Yeah.

104
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
A few months to look forward to.

105
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,440
How many builds are we doing a day now?

106
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Ah, a few.

107
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,520
Once or twice a day, I'll push up some stuff.

108
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:45,880
So, so yesterday we talked with, uh, with Andrew Grummit, uh, a little bit about, uh, the developers

109
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,960
program that we'll have going on, and, but you really kind of blew us away, you know,

110
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,160
early on with the whole concept of the modules, uh, in podshow plus, which is, uh, something

111
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,680
that's going to be complete, audience controlled.

112
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,320
So, uh, what, why don't you, uh, tell us a bit about the modules and some of the stuff

113
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,040
that the developers will be, uh, be able to work on first, the stuff that you would work

114
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,280
on because, you know, it really is your brain child.

115
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,240
Oh, the way that the modules basically work are, they're just little widgets, so to speak,

116
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,720
that, uh, let you put in whatever code you'd like, and, uh, people can add them to their

117
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,400
profile page, they can move around, they can add more modules, they can remove their modules,

118
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:31,400
they can, you know, change the color of the page, kind of, give the actual users complete

119
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,200
control over how they want to develop their own, their own profile page, uh, and this applies

120
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:43,880
to both shows and to the listeners themselves, um, so, while there is a ton of, uh, podshow

121
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,960
exclusive modules that tap into, you know, the different features of the pdn and podshow

122
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,240
plus, um, there's also third party modules, uh, like, for instance, uh, bringing in your flicker

123
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,440
pictures, uh, bringing in your delicious links, uh, weather modules, all kinds of third party

124
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,040
stuff that are just, uh, let you customize and really make your site, what you want it to be.

125
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,520
Now, these, um, you said something interesting there because we, we do have a lot of APIs,

126
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,360
which will be publishing and all kinds of stuff that ties in, you know, um, you know, one ties into

127
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,040
the other, of course, we actually have a whole entity out there, the pod save music network

128
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:24,120
going to be tying that in as well. Um, will developers be able to, uh, work on some of that stuff

129
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,680
as well, or, you know, will it, will it be a place where they can, uh, ideate and, and work on ideas

130
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:36,440
of, of integration of existing podshow stuff? That's definitely planned. Uh, this first SDK release

131
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:44,760
is, uh, really limited to third party, uh, applications and bringing in content, uh, but I'm definitely

132
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,320
planning on opening up some of the, the core functionality of the PDN, letting people get in there

133
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:55,400
and do stuff with our show data, our user data, um, and really, you know, actually extend

134
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:02,280
podshow plus, uh, completely. Excellent. Hold on, hold on a second, Kevin. Oh, oh my gosh. Oh,

135
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:09,800
that, uh, up. I just saw a golden ticket swoosh by saw a couple of them go. So, if you didn't

136
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:15,880
hear about 30 seconds of me telling you how to get in, then you didn't win. I'm sorry.

137
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,480
Ah, some lucky developers are already registering as we speak. So, um,

138
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,760
what is your involvement going to be in, um, in, in this process, Kevin, uh, you know,

139
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:36,280
Andrew's really going to be managing, I think, a lot of the, um, the, uh, the source for

140
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,800
project, whatever we're going to use for it. Now, I see tons of comments on, uh, the dev cast, uh,

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,400
show site. What, what are you going to be doing? And will you be accessible to the, to developers

142
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,440
who have questions? Uh, I definitely will be, uh, you can reach me at Kevin at podshow.com. If you have

143
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:59,000
any specific technical questions, uh, I'm really the guy that is behind the SDK and the code in the,

144
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,720
in podshow plus. So, I'd be the best person to contact on that. Um, my time's pretty limited. So,

145
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,600
I can't guarantee I'll get back here right away, but I definitely welcome feedback questions,

146
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,320
comments. Uh, you can cost me out if you want to. That's all cool with me. Oh, excellent way.

147
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:21,720
That was Kevin at podshow. I said, right that down for the cursing. Uh, so who else, um,

148
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,960
of the dev team should we have next up in the dev cast? I mean, there's so, so many different

149
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,520
moving, you know, parts to this that, you know, and as you said, there's even employees that I haven't

150
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,240
met yet in the time that I've been back in, uh, in the UK, who, who should we have on next and

151
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,360
how will that pertain to the, uh, to the developers who are coming in? Wow, that's a, that's a

152
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:46,120
tough one. Yeah, everybody's doing such cool stuff. Um, you know, we have, uh, saw who's really

153
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:52,280
gearing up our search technologies, uh, letting, letting us expand beyond, uh, you know, normal,

154
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:58,680
PHP, my sequel, text indexing, uh, brought in a, uh, new guy Kurt, who's just really been kicking

155
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:05,400
some ass on, uh, on a lyrics system. Um, we brought a, a Gavin from a, from tag.com. He's,

156
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,360
Oh, Gavin? Gavin's Gavin's in? Oh, that's cool. Yes, Gavin is in. He's been here for a couple

157
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,640
weeks now. Oh, shit. No, I know, because I personally, uh, and, you know, I call them a couple times,

158
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,120
uh, trying to convince him to come and work for us, and I think he, he, like, lost his cell phone or

159
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,520
something. I was really bombed, and then, you know, just as I was leaving, we got, we got, we got in touch

160
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,240
again. So he's in. That's fantastic. Good. Okay. He's, he's working on our back and admin stuff,

161
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,800
which is going to be really cool. Give us a lot of flexibility and control. So I'm,

162
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,520
there's, there's all kinds of people here that you, you should be talking to, not just me.

163
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:44,440
How about, how about Erin? I, I'd love to talk to Erin because she's, she, she is so trippy, man. I love,

164
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:50,280
I love it. I love what she's doing. She's, she's great. She's, uh, definitely a trip to work with,

165
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:57,320
but, uh, man, she's a smarker. And she's, uh, our, our DBA, or she's our DBA, and she's also heads up

166
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:04,040
our, um, IT department, essentially, uh, but really focusing on the DBA work and working with a

167
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,280
rack space, our managed hosting solution to make sure our servers are off and running.

168
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,160
Excellent. And, uh, and doing a good job, except, uh, there's a little hiccup last night on the

169
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,840
PMN. Yeah. What, uh, I got, like, ton of emails this morning. Oh, man, something's gone wrong.

170
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,440
I can't, and I'll tell you, I was about to do my show and really bummed me out. I'm like,

171
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,600
I can't, I can't get any songs. It was really, it was horrible. It was like,

172
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,960
but some wiki got set up and it bogged everything down or something like that.

173
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,840
Um, it was a combination of that. And I think there's a patch applied to a patchy, that didn't

174
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:42,760
take so well, so we've rolled everything back and things should be good now. So I apologize to all

175
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,760
the people that needed to get to it. No, I think everyone understands. And, you know, but it's,

176
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,160
I hope there's also a couple of, you know, maybe non-developers who are listening because now you

177
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,600
really start to understand how much work goes into doing this. You know, when, when you hear how

178
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,160
many people are on it and all the different issues. And of course, we're, we're actually scaling

179
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,800
internally pretty quickly, you know, just on podshow plus and the pdm, we've got a lot of shows.

180
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,240
We've got a lot of users in there. Of course, you know, all of our, um, uh, a lot of the podcasters

181
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:17,400
that we, that we met at the portable media expo, it's, uh, it's, it's, it's really kind of growing

182
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:23,080
all in, uh, simultaneously. Yeah, definitely. I'm Richard's been doing a great job of bringing

183
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:29,160
in some good quality shows. Um, and I see the, I see the sign-up emails coming by my inbox

184
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,600
almost daily if us bringing in these shows and letting them actually use the tools and, you know,

185
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,560
put it out into their feed currently, uh, I'd like to turn it on. So, you know, people could start

186
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:45,160
using the podshow plus feeds, but I mean, it's great to see people actually using parts of it.

187
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:51,560
That's a lot of good feedback. That's a question I actually had is, um, will, will be able to

188
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:57,240
selectively turn on some of the show sites before everything is, is publicly available?

189
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,920
Um, not necessarily entire show site, but, um, we could start slowly exposed the, you know, the

190
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:12,120
XML, uh, start with that, and then maybe just open up the listener side without, you know,

191
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,760
it's up the registrations. I mean, there's a lot of stuff we can do to kind of slowly ramp up

192
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,160
and get people in there and isn't it? But, uh, you know, opening the floodgates is an out of the

193
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:27,800
question either. So, uh, as he throws down the gauntlet, I love it. I love it. All right, dude,

194
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,200
well, listen, I don't want to keep you too much longer. Um, I'm going to get in touch with, uh,

195
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,480
I just saw a mail coming from Andrew, so I guess we can get this when I'll set up for those

196
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:42,760
golden tickets that just flew by. And, um, um, maybe just to tell, uh, tell, if you don't mind

197
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,320
tell Aaron that I'd love to talk with her tomorrow, if she has time, just to get your insights into

198
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,680
what she's been doing, because that database stuff. That's like, that's art, man. That's not

199
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:57,080
science. That's fucking art. No, that is an art form. But, uh, guys, go over real quick what this

200
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:03,400
SDK is going to, yes, please. So, yeah, let people know what they expect. Um, and basically,

201
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:09,720
it's just a lightweight framework. Um, we'll be providing a first that, you know, we'll just

202
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,200
basically let people say preference data to start. So, you know, it's, it's really small lightweight.

203
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:20,600
You get a single class with some helper functions. Um, we do use the script calculus, uh,

204
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,680
JavaScript framework, so Ajax all over the place is cool with us. Um, and since this is

205
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:33,080
really just, uh, PHP, straight PHP coding, um, you know, all of our modules are going to have to be

206
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:39,640
reviewed and analyzed and make sure that nobody's trying to hack into us kind of thing. But, um,

207
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,840
I mean, I've been trying for months. What are you talking about? It's really, it's really flexible.

208
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:52,120
I mean, it's really just a blank slate for people to, to create on, um, you know, the actual SDK itself

209
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,680
will provide you with starting points, um, you know, you enter your module name. It'll create

210
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,000
based off of a base template to get you started. So, you don't have to reinvent the wheel there.

211
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,920
But then it's really up to the, the developer. And this time goes on, we'll be adding, you know,

212
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,320
supporting classes to let you tap into our shows and our, and our users. So,

213
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,840
look forward for some really cool stuff. And, uh, you know, you'll have lots of control over

214
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:23,560
what your module stays. So, so, you said, you only mentioned PHP. Does that mean that if I have

215
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:28,600
even, uh, a working knowledge of PHP that I can participate and I can try and create a module,

216
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,120
is it something that will eventually, you know, that anyone can do this if they, you're like,

217
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,800
on my space, right? They've, you know, my daughter is now hacking up HTML, um, yeah, and, and she's

218
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:43,080
figured out how to change something so she can hide her comments. Yeah, it's pretty basic stuff.

219
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,440
But, I mean, will we get to the point where it, where, you know, even someone like that,

220
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,640
can, can create a module? Absolutely. I mean, you can make a module that's just a simple

221
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,200
hello world module, or you can build a full application. It's really what your work knowledge

222
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:01,400
is. On the other side, that's time goes on. We'll be releasing a client-side SDK as well.

223
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:07,960
That'll let developers use, you know, just JavaScript, uh, XML, and, uh, it's a VHDML.

224
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,040
And, and that will be instant, you know, you'll be able to just basically send a module

225
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,600
to the developer friend and have them install it. But that's, that's some time out, um, as, you

226
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,640
know, we prep up for launch. I've got, uh, lots of other things to worry about. Yeah, I hear you.

227
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:28,360
Right here. Busy, busy, busy, busy, right? I'll code no sleep. That's my model. Yeah, I'm sending

228
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,360
some mountain do your way. Sweet. All right, Kevin. Dude, cool. All right, thank you very much.

229
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,000
And, uh, we'll check in sometime next week and, uh, just, see how's everything's going on.

230
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,320
Keep these, these dev cast relatively short. So I'm going to take too much of any one's time.

231
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,920
And, uh, say hi to everyone at, uh, at HQ for me. I will. I'll tell Aaron to expect a call for me.

232
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,000
All right. Yes. So, uh, around the same time tomorrow. Sounds good. All right, buddy. Thanks,

233
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,840
like, Kevin. Take it easy. Okay, but bye, bye, bye. There you go. Get this podcast and more great ones
