I'm on the show.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I only do autograph after the show.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I need to be the crush.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Find the drug that will get us high.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I see it all from a different point of view.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll never sell you out.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Is that what this is all about?

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
My mouth is dry.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And I thought you would roll my side up.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Way to stand.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Right in the wall.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We don't get in the walls alone.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
After all.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's all alone.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Today is the day we run away.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Today is the day we run away.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Today is the day I'm getting off on you.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Today is the day I can't but push.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Find the drug that will get me higher.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Leave it all behind for something new.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Did I sell you out?

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Is that what this is all about?

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You will.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's dry.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But I don't think you wasting your time on me.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If you ride it on the wall.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We don't get in the walls alone.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
After all.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's all alone.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's all alone.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We don't get in the walls alone.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We don't get in the walls alone.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We don't get in the walls alone.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We don't get in the walls alone.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We don't get in the walls alone.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We don't get in the walls alone.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We don't get in the walls alone.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We don't get in the walls alone.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We don't get in the walls alone.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We don't get in the walls alone.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We don't get in the walls alone.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We don't get in the walls alone.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We don't get in the walls alone.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We don't get in the walls alone.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We don't get in the walls alone.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
After all.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
We ride in the walls alone.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We don't get in the walls alone.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
After all.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
For a new York City straight to your ear buds.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Thanks to the proudly music network.

It's only love.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And it already weighs.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Everybody how you are coming to you from the affluent suburb of Surrey.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's An kills for it.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That's right.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Direct from Kurii Kotters your daily source code.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,240
Now, I'm going to assume that most people who listen to the show actually are no longer in school.

81
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,080
Do you remember the days?

82
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,080
The day and today is one of those days.

83
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,040
If you look outside, it's it's beautiful weather.

84
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,720
The birds are chirping in the background.

85
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,480
If I just shut up for a second, you'll hear them.

86
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,000
Come on, you crap heads.

87
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,000
See, when you ask them to, they never do it.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,040
The birds are chirping.

89
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,680
The sun is shining.

90
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,960
And remember when you were in high school, or maybe even in grade school.

91
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,720
And those wonderful words the teacher would say is, kids, today we're going to do some different.

92
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,120
We're going to take class outside.

93
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,760
You remember that and like, and you'd really be into it and you'd all go sit on the grass in the sunshine

94
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:22,200
or maybe in the shade and he'd bring along some of the drink and he'd have your books.

95
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,840
And actually it was, you'd really be able to concentrate really well and there was always a good vibe.

96
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,240
Well, I want to do something different today as well.

97
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,000
This morning, I was sitting in the big green thing going through the pod segment music network,

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,840
listening to all the new tracks that have been submitted.

99
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,800
By the way, this is something I used to do when I was on the radio.

100
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,280
Once a week, the record promoters would come by and say, hey, here's this new song,

101
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,080
here's this song, check out this album, check out this record.

102
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,960
And we'd spend a couple hours on a Friday, usually, going through all the new releases of the week.

103
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,400
But these days with the pod segment music network, you can do that.

104
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,120
In fact, you not only can you, but I do that every single day.

105
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,720
I sit here and I listen to all the new tracks and all the diverse music and I'm always smiling.

106
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,280
Whether I like the songs or not, just I can't believe the energy that people are putting into this.

107
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,960
So I figured today would just play a lot of music and stuff like that.

108
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,000
Adam, yeah.

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Aaron.

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Aaron.

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,360
Hey, just wanted to call and find out why I lately, everybody that's been leaving a U of message on the voicemail,

112
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,880
sounds like they went to the Captain Kirk School of Broadcasting.

113
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,880
Exactly.

114
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,160
And I enjoyed Sierra, number two is what's up with that, man.

115
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,160
I mean, like, what a bunch of non-polishers, who doesn't have time to sit around to

116
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
almond-collar, voicemail.

117
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Yeah.

118
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
Yeah.

119
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,160
Love a show.

120
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Crashing.

121
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,160
Burn it.

122
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
Exactly.

123
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,000
Not a lot of voicemails in today's show.

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,080
If you want to leave one, though, you can give us a call in New Jersey.

125
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,520
The numbers 201, 625, 635, 7.

126
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,520
In London, our number is O2O, 768, 1375, 3.

127
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,440
You won't hear any fancy greeting just to, hey, leave your message and I look forward to

128
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
hearing from you.

129
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,480
So, in the vein of playing music today, some more stuff in the pod save music network.

130
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,680
Delphany and blue, and California.

143
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:51,680
show in the show notes, a daily source code dot com.

144
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,960
It's so cool reading the bios of these artists that they put up themselves on the

145
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
pot safe music network.

146
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,960
He's from the District of Columbia.

147
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,160
I'm just going to read this verbatim.

148
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,720
Delphinium blue has been described as a mixture of Pet Shop Boys, Prince, Moby, and

149
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Pet Shmode.

150
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,680
It's pop rock wrapped up in electronic production created by one guy, Arlon Godwin, an openly

151
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,040
gay songwriter and producer who was performed before more than 250,000 people in the last

152
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,040
year alone.

153
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,960
Yeah, all of the songs that you hear today on the Daily Source Code will be made available

154
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:26,200
for purchase if the artist wants that because that's all part of the big, unlabeled concept.

155
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,040
This is so liberating, man.

156
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,040
I used to do music shows all the time, but it was kind of whatever came out of the computer.

157
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,120
Of course, when I was doing shows 25 years ago, that's kind of like old school, you know,

158
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,520
feeling good.

159
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:46,240
So I'm going through through my email and through notes and I stumbled across a news report,

160
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,480
which it really shocked me that I hadn't that I didn't know this had happened a couple

161
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
of weeks ago.

162
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,360
The report that I read was from June 6, so I think it's from the first week of June.

163
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,280
I did not know that Billy Preston passed away.

164
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,080
If you don't know, and the whole fact that I, and I was in the US, I think it was in

165
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
the States, right?

166
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,640
I mean, this is Billy Preston deserves more than, you know, just a little mention in

167
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,400
rollings on rollingstone.com.

168
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:17,280
He deserves more than maybe a quick 15 second to pass away this week in entertainment tonight.

169
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,480
This guy deserves some major props.

170
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,160
He was truly the fifth beetle.

171
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,320
And the sixth rolling stone, if you think about it.

172
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,520
Here's this, this is from my thing, this is from rollingstone.com.

173
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,960
Let me just read this to you.

174
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,520
Billy Preston, the exuberant keyboardist who landed dream gigs with the beetles and the

175
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,120
rolling stones and enjoyed his own series of hit singles, including out of space and nothing

176
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,920
from nothing died Tuesday at age 59, which is way too fucking young.

177
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
Rolling stone didn't write that.

178
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,080
That was editorial by me.

179
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,560
Preston's long-time manager, Joyce Moore said Preston had been in a coma since November

180
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,560
and a care facility and was taken to a hospital in Scottsdale, Arizona, Saturday after

181
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,640
his condition deteriorated.

182
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,680
She says he had a very, very beautiful last few hours and a very beautiful passing.

183
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,640
Preston who had battled to chronic kidney failure had undergone a kidney transplant in 2002,

184
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,760
but the kidney failed and he had been on dialysis treatments ever since.

185
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Okay, so 75% of this report is about him dying and not about the tremendous amount

186
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,200
of work this guy created for us.

187
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:29,000
And of course, none of the songs that he created are pod safe.

188
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,160
But in this case, I think I have to make an exception to my own rule and I really don't

189
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:39,280
care if I go to jail for this because Billy Preston deserves to be remembered in rock

190
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,080
and roll in pop history as someone who was really important and instrumental.

191
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:52,280
And also, and this is a widely known fact in rock and roll, not very known in entertainment

192
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:58,200
show business reporting, but apparently he also had a huge penis, it's just one of those

193
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,640
things you pick up, you know, being in the business for years and years.

194
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,280
And at one point, I believe he was married, I don't know if he was married to Syrida or

195
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:13,240
Syrida was married to Stevie Wonder, I can't really remember how that all fit together.

196
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,200
But he had a couple of hits with Syrida, one I could not find on the Napster, which is

197
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,480
it will come in time, which was one of my favorites.

198
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,720
And from when I was growing up, but he had a huge smash all over Europe with the song

199
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,200
that I'm going to play for you now, again, it's not pod safe, but damn Billy Preston,

200
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,520
I'm going to miss you.

201
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:42,720
With you on Born Again, Billy Preston and Syrida, illegal play on the Charney.

202
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:55,400
Come bring me your softness, come for me through all this madness, warm and

203
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:01,880
don't you know with you, I'm born again.

204
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:15,880
Come give me the most weakness, now that you there is no weakness, the life safe

205
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:23,920
within your arms I'm with you.

206
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:44,160
I was half, not whole, instead, with none, which of you is born, and need of one.

207
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:53,880
Come show me your kindness, in your arms I know I'll find this, warm and

208
00:15:53,880 --> 00:16:02,880
don't you know with you, I'm born again.

209
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:36,840
Come bring me your softness, come for me through all this madness, warm and

210
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:44,880
don't you know with you, I'm born again.

211
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:52,840
Come bring me your softness, come for me through all this madness, warm and

212
00:16:52,840 --> 00:17:11,000
don't you know with you, I'm born again, I was half, not whole, instead, with none,

213
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:21,000
which of you is born, need of one.

214
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Come show me your kindness, in your arms I know I'll find this, warm and

215
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:40,000
don't you know with you, I'm born again.

216
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Come bring me your softness, come for me through all this madness, warm and don't

217
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
you know with you, I'm born again.

218
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Come bring me your softness, come for me through all this madness, warm and don't

219
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
know with you, I'm born again on the daily source code, and that really does piss me off

220
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
when people who've contributed so much get so overlooked because of populist demand for

221
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
entertainment content.

222
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I really truly feel that's my duty to bring stuff like that to you, and I think it's

223
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
well worth the risk in this case.

224
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Another one of those fabulous musicians and artists who contributed so much, certainly in my

225
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:43,000
lifetime with the music which of course is the soundtrack to your life was Dan Hartman,

226
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,520
and he died, oh man, I think Dan passed away 12, 13 years ago, and not a fucking

227
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,560
peep man, almost nothing, and this guy made, he was a personal friend, but he had so many

228
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:01,920
hits, just unbelievable, and I remember, and this was pre-podcasting, I was still at

229
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:07,320
MTV, I could barely get him to play a video, you know, I can dream about you as the more

230
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:13,640
like a VH1 video, if it's dude, it's Dan Frick and Hartman, and I just never really understood.

231
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:19,480
So again, I feel that's my duty to highlight some of that stuff when it comes along,

232
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,240
which I hope isn't too often because we like having all these great artists around, you

233
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
know what I mean?

234
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,040
Ah, okay, let me see how we doing now, I think I can play one more song here that the

235
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,480
serious satellite listeners will be able to enjoy, of course, those of you tuning in on

236
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,440
serious stars 102, you're in the middle of our pod show podcast block, taking up your

237
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,720
10, the clock in the eastern time zone, we have Pacific Coast Hellway coming up, he's

238
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:50,320
radio, Don Drew, Steve Gilmore's Daily Show, let's see, Thursday today, so I think it's

239
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,400
also digital flawed some, and of course, Michael Butler will wind it up with some pod

240
00:19:53,400 --> 00:20:00,040
safe tunes and some good kickass rock and roll between 930 and 10 o'clock.

241
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:05,040
From British Columbia, Johnny Ferreira, he's an award-winning saxophonist, international

242
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,320
touring and recording artists that writes and performs his old brand of R&B, swing, jazz,

243
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,960
and rock and roll, backed by his 8 piece band with horn section, rock and guitar, boogie

244
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,720
piano and his screaming sax, it's something different, I think you're like the 90

245
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:26,720
down, I don't care about you cleaning up, I'm making your eyes as quiet enough, I won't

246
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:33,520
even watch a Stanley Cup when you're well and I'm not it gown, just out of here and

247
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:40,280
let's snuggle up, I light up the candles and feel your cup, I got me standing at a

248
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:47,560
tension now and you're wearing that night again, I've been waiting so long for this

249
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:55,720
side to barely control myself, the little lovin's a what I missed, I can't think enough

250
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:01,960
then there's such a night night, night night, night, night, night, night, night again, I've

251
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:08,760
taught all the way around, you know what I'm saying, when you're wearing that night

252
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:15,560
it gown, I'm buttering creams, what your skin feels like, there's a rubbing your shoulders

253
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:21,720
left to right, I always want to stay the rest of the night when you're wearing that night

254
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:31,400
it gown, don't even get some air, the neighbors might see but I don't care, I know if I was

255
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:38,520
there, but I would stay when you're wearing that night it gown, well I've been waiting so long

256
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:47,240
for this side to barely control myself, the little lovin's a what I missed, I can't think enough

257
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:56,200
then there's such a night night, night, night, night, night again, I've taught all the way around

258
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:05,960
I've taught all the way around, you know what I'm saying, when you're wearing that night it gown, yeah baby

259
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:34,360
my night night night, night night, night, night, night again, I've taught all the way around,

260
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:51,320
you know what I'm saying, when you're wearing that night it gown, I'm buttering creams, what your skin feels like you're

261
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,320
night it down night night night night it down

262
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,320
It's tight tight tight, I'll never wait around

263
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,320
You won't say it and I won't say it

264
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,320
When you're wearing that naughty gown

265
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,320
When you're wearing that naughty gown

266
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,320
When you're wearing that naughty gown

267
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,320
When you're wearing that naughty gown

268
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,320
I know about you

269
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,320
But you just don't hear enough of that on the radio

270
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
You know what I'm saying?

271
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
You cannot get that anywhere else

272
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
Podcasts are bringing it to you

273
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
You can find that all in the Pods have music network

274
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,320
Every single genre that you can think of is there

275
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
It's really busy this week for me

276
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
Every single evening we're going on until

277
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,320
Or at least I'm going on until around 11.30 midnight

278
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,320
Talking to Pod Show HQ in San Francisco

279
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,320
As we near the unleashing of Pod Show

280
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,320
The Pod Show Plus, the Pod Cast delivery network

281
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,320
And portions at least of the upgraded Pods

282
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,320
Pod Save Music Network

283
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,320
It's all going to come together at the same time

284
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,320
Just before we start opening up our offices in the UK

285
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,320
It's getting nuts

286
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,320
And I know I haven't given you an official date

287
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,320
But trust me when I say that we'll be liberating your media

288
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,320
Yeah, here's something I want you to help me out with

289
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,320
So of course I've been keeping you up to speed on my mom's progress

290
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,320
And one thing that is maybe the Charlie listeners can help with

291
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,320
Because I've had four doctors look at it, mouth hygienists

292
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,320
All kinds of specialists

293
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,320
Because of my mom's diminished immunity

294
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,320
She's developed these blisters in her mouth

295
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,320
Which makes it incredibly painful to eat

296
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,320
Or even in many cases to drink

297
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
Crap

298
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,320
If you're on serious, go to dailysourcecode.com

299
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
And listen to the rest of the show

300
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,320
So you can hear exactly what I need from you

301
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,320
Because maybe you guys can help

302
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,320
PCH is next if you're listening to stars 102

303
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,320
And those of you who of course are really hit to

304
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,320
And listen to the Pod Cast, you can just keep listening

305
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,320
So these are like source

306
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,320
And I don't want to cross you out

307
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,320
But it makes it incredibly difficult for her to eat

308
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,320
Which of course is the one thing she needs to do

309
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,320
The most right now is eat

310
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,320
And we've tried everything, everything off the shelf

311
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,320
So you don't have, you know

312
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
There's all kinds of stuff that will numb it out

313
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
And give you temporary relief

314
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,320
But it's really looking for a longer term solution

315
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,320
There may not be one

316
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,320
But if you know of anyone who's in the same situation

317
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,320
My mom is in

318
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,320
And has had something similar

319
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,320
And if you know of a solution

320
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
I'd be very happy to hear from you

321
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,320
Adamaccurry.com

322
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
Today kicks off Nomdex

323
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
In Seattle, Washington

324
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,320
This is a Chris Perillo's show

325
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
Chris and Ponzi

326
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
I have to say it's really Ponzi show

327
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,320
I'm sorry Chris

328
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,320
But Ponzi really is the engine behind this

329
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
You're the front man dude

330
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
You know, you're like a facade

331
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
Just like me for Pod Show

332
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
But it's okay because we all need a strong woman behind us

333
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
Making a shit really happen

334
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
Now unfortunately I couldn't be at Nomdex

335
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
I had fully planned on being there

336
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,320
Because I really do enjoy the show

337
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,320
And I think it is

338
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
It's a great place to meet people

339
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
It's a great place to hear interesting speakers

340
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,320
And it's just a well organized conference

341
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
And it's always a lot of fun

342
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
And Chris and Ponzi are full of so much energy

343
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
It's just a joy just to watch them

344
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
As they go about making this a huge party

345
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
So I want to congratulate them

346
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
First off with the Nomdex 6.0

347
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
And Derek Kay Miller

348
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
Created a song about it

349
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
Which is pretty funny

350
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
And I'd love to share it with

351
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
Nomdex

352
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
It's typical to explain

353
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
It's typical to explain

354
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,320
Nomdex

355
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
Nomdex

356
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
It's big bang

357
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
Nomdex

358
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,320
It's a set of the sun

359
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
Nomdex

360
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
For the good and boys

361
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
Nomdex

362
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,320
All the high tick toys

363
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
But cast an aggregate

364
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
Video black and crazy tagging

365
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
Harry's pissing Ponzi running

366
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,320
Madly at the course

367
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,320
Don't cheat for death

368
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,320
All the free swag

369
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,320
To be had

370
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,320
Because I've become a monster

371
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,320
Nomdex

372
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
Every conference

373
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
Sucked and I turned it around

374
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
I attended my first nomdex to the age of six

375
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
Every then I know about life

376
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
Love for the human condition

377
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,320
I learned a nomdex

378
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
If mankind

379
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,320
Will be saved

380
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
The answers will be found

381
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
Among the pocket presenters

382
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
Any bad memories

383
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
Are my people working in the fight

384
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
Oh, easy

385
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
Nomdex is like that

386
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
I'm into the picture

387
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,320
I say, so I'm here

388
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,320
All our good friends

389
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,320
I don't know Nomdex

390
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
It's a point here

391
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,320
It's a witch factor

392
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
Up into the fucker

393
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,320
If you're tired

394
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,320
I'd light up

395
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,320
When they give you something

396
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,320
I'd give you something

397
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,320
I'd give you something

398
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
I'd like to give you a nomdex

399
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,320
I'd like a nomdex

400
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,320
I'd like a nomdex

401
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,320
The audience might echo you

402
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,320
Upon the stage

403
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,320
And your choice

404
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,320
Of a web feed format

405
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,320
My cause of rage

406
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
You know I think

407
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,320
We really ought to try

408
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,320
To the globe

409
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,320
That bandwidth

410
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,320
All that bandwidth

411
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,320
Sky high

412
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,320
The world's shortest

413
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Teddy Gettles so low

414
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
For fantasy, yes

415
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,320
And life world

416
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,320
Ask common to count

417
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,320
Mags, boats, paddling

418
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
Seas, mobile phones

419
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
They look at me

420
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,320
Don't know what makes it so good

421
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,320
We brought an algorithm

422
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,320
To explain it

423
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,320
Every good

424
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,320
I won't

425
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,320
But we can't

426
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,320
Nondex

427
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,320
Seas, boats, paddling

428
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,320
Nondex

429
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
Is it one or three points?

430
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,320
Cloud everyone

431
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,320
Nondex

432
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
It's piggybound

433
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
Nondex

434
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,320
It keeps us out of control

435
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,320
I'd like people

436
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,320
Come in with that

437
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,320
Give someone to say

438
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
Hey, could I come and pitch my product

439
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
We basically kick them in the shin

440
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:20,320
I hope there's a life feed like last year so I can listen in because I truly look forward to hear any of that and that was it

441
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,320
John Edwards is keynote speaker, so that should be a good show

442
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:32,320
You know, I forget every single time I do one of these segments. I get a whole slew of yanks versus the Britscom

443
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:47,320
Everybody knows that it's a yarn to see. Let's just like you and me. It's the yanks and the Brits

444
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,320
The yanks versus the Brits

445
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:59,320
Mind the gap Charles quietly sent me something really funny. He'd picked up which totally encompasses and encapsulates

446
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,320
What the real differences are between the yanks and the Brits from the Brits side this time

447
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:11,320
Here we go. Being British is about driving in a German car to an Irish pub for a Belgian beer

448
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:21,320
Then traveling home grabbing an Indian curry or a Turkish cabab on the way to sit on a sweetest furniture and watch American shows on a Japanese television

449
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,320
And the most British thing of all well of course suspicion of anything foreign

450
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:35,320
Here's the central part dude. He's also on the pot safe music network Tom Cruise scares me

451
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:42,320
How about you? He shouldn't be that scary

452
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,320
He's only five foot two

453
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:53,320
But ten people some mission impossible three because he's always talking back

454
00:30:53,320 --> 00:31:00,320
Scientology makes an ordinary guy like me say Tom Cruise scares me

455
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,320
Oprah scares me just like a little pub

456
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,320
I think on her worst day she could beat me up

457
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:23,320
Now she started out like a nice young girl but you better watch out because once your plans unfold

458
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,320
She's gonna take over the world and Oprah scares me

459
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:35,320
Another guy who scares me is that David Blaine

460
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,320
Things he's extraordinary

461
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
I think he's quite insane

462
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,320
35 hours just standing on top of a pole

463
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,320
Then he tried to hold his breath in a goldfish pole

464
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,320
To die prime time is his goal and he scares me

465
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,320
Dick Cheney scares me

466
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,320
With those be the eyes

467
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,320
They get intense and glary

468
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,320
Every time he lies which is often

469
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,320
He's got a machine where his heart should be

470
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,320
Just pumping out an evil philosophy

471
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,320
Issues people in the face and gets away

472
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,320
Scott free and he scares me

473
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,320
Wolfe puts her scares me

474
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,320
I just think it's nuts

475
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,320
To have a name that's scary

476
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,320
Wolfe puts her on such a little pots

477
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,320
Now the folks at CNN think the man's revered

478
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,320
But he's kind of like an elf with a scruffy fear

479
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,320
And his monotone voices just a little too

480
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,320
Winner and it scares me everybody

481
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
Talk to the scares me

482
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
How about you?

483
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,320
How about you?

484
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,320
He shouldn't be that scary

485
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,320
He shouldn't be that scary

486
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,320
How tall is he?

487
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,320
He's only five but two

488
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,320
But ten people saw a mission in possible three

489
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,320
Because he's always dreaming about a Scientology

490
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,320
Makes an ordinary guy like me

491
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,320
Save Tom Cruise scares me

492
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,320
Ordinary people like you and me

493
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,320
Save Tom Cruise scares me

494
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
David, he polito is his name

495
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,320
He can find him in Central Park in New York City

496
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,320
Hundreds of thousands of people have seen him there

497
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,320
He performs during these months really

498
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,320
He's funny

499
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,320
And he's got his stuff up on the pod save music

500
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
Now work all the links to that of course in the show today

501
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,320
And for the ongoing conversation go to curry.com

502
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
And all that's going to change pretty soon

503
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,320
As we move over to pod show plus

504
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,320
New tools for listeners, ways for you to enjoy pod

505
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
Cast better for you to share pod cast with others

506
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,320
To talk about them, to promote them, to contribute to them

507
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,320
It's like magic box

508
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,320
All right

509
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,320
Dude, I think that's it

510
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,320
That's right

511
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,320
I was going to say that this has been nice

512
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,320
Hope you enjoyed it

513
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,320
Hope you liked the songs

514
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
Of course, the beauty of pod casting

515
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,320
As you can skip through a song you don't like

516
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,320
And this is just fun

517
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,320
In fact, this is the kind, well not these songs in particular

518
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,320
But I do like kind of DJing stuff

519
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,320
I really missed doing that

520
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,320
And once we get pod show plus pushed out

521
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,320
And we're rolling with that

522
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,320
I certainly plan on doing some DJing at the pod show

523
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,320
Palace in second life

524
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,320
We've got, I call it DD

525
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,320
What's her name? Drew

526
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,320
D-R-U

527
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,320
She's, uh, she's been doing the DJing

528
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
She's from the UK

529
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,320
And she's so, the way she does it is so cute

530
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
It's really an enjoyable experience

531
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,320
Just too bad

532
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,320
That, you know, all the limitations of second life

533
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,320
You can basically only have 28 people listening to it

534
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
At the same time

535
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,320
Thanks to Cast Blaster Mike for sending me the new new new new new beta version

536
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,320
As we get ready to integrate everything

537
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,320
Not only does it now post directly up to the podcast delivery network

538
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
It's got a little HTML editor in there

539
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,320
Which, uh, well, you'll see

540
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,320
I've used it on the show today

541
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,320
And, uh, bam, it's just getting so much easier

542
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,320
Even for me

543
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,320
I'll see you tomorrow everybody

544
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,320
Take care and of course tomorrow

545
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,320
Friday festivities

546
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,320
Get your pod safe music picks in

547
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,320
Another pod show podcast

548
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,320
Stick it in your ear

549
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,320
Get this pod cast

550
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,320

On the high performance pod cast

552
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,320
Delivery network from Podjo

553
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,320
And line-white networks

554
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,320
I love it
