This is Delta CR Charlie, 511, and for God's sake, don't buy Sunfeld DVDs.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Because my carry-chat is a racist, don't watch when it keeps on moving.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Because he's a racist too.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You can listen to this podcast, however, because Adam carry is not a racist.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Adam carry doesn't hate anybody.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
In fact, Adam carry loves you, dear listener of DSC.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hey, I don't know where that is.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But Adam carries the power to the other side.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh, I've lived at 54 feet below the ground.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I've traveled westbound.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I have to get to get to get this gift on my wish list.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But the limits tick with the quickness, and still no one's solving the business.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No one hears speaks my language.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No one here has my currency.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm the founder, and the wise man, so this song is a one.

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm going home.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm going home.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm going home.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm going home.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm going home.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm going home.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm going home.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm going home.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm going home.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm going home.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm going home.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm going home.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm going home.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm going home.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm going home.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I can't feel my legs anymore, I'm so far from the shore.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Behind the lift and girl with the face cast, so live in the cramp of the candy dance.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This can't be half for the move any faster, so I'm stopping trying at the air.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Like an asshole.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
There's no one in big for language.

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No one here has the currency.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm a thief under and the wise man look me dead in the eyes and he's the power.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I can't use the pay for all he can't use the two bucks and the wonder.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh no!

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh no!

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Oh no!

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Oh no!

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh no!

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I remember the days when they got to you all and I can't live today, for let me know the chase from all of us.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I remember the days when they got to you all and I can't live your whole journey.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I can't live today, for let me know the chase from all of us.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Oh my God!

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's too big and you're busy staying true.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But my heart will break into you.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,560
raste!

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:21,720
Well, it's definitely different.

55
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,200
Johnny Sonic Pesso's Euro kicking off the daily source code for your food bar Friday.

56
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,040
We are without a doubt fucked up beyond all repair.

57
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,280
It is episode number 511 of the Charlie Good Morning, everybody from Northern California.

58
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,320
San Francisco in the Curri condo, beautiful morning.

59
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,960
The sky is completely red.

60
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,640
The sun is just coming up over the clouds in the distance over the day.

61
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,680
And even though, in fact, I'm going to actually put down the shade here.

62
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,920
So I can see what's on my screen.

63
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,160
You know, there's an old, uh, damn, that's loud.

64
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:04,680
There's an old sailor's, uh, Ryan that says, uh, uh, reds, uh, reds guys at night.

65
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,200
Sailors delight reds guys at morning, sailors take warning.

66
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,560
I don't know, though, because I've had some really nice red mornings here in, in the Bay area.

67
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,240
And the days have been just fantastic.

68
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,160
Although yesterday did you hear what happened in London?

69
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,520
They had a typhoon run through London?

70
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,440
Now Patricia called me about that yesterday.

71
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,960
She said, you have no idea what happened.

72
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,440
I said, why?

73
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,800
It was like a typhoon.

74
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,840
It was the weirdest thing.

75
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,400
And of course, we're south of London, south west of London.

76
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,120
And she said, it was tremendous hail.

77
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,560
And, you know, the cats actually came running in before the hail hit.

78
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,960
They were just like, boo, like bullets out of a gun.

79
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Because, of course, they felt something weird was up.

80
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,880
As, uh, as pets often do, I guess, with, uh, with these natural, uh, phenomenon.

81
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:53,080
And, uh, and, and apparently, it's not all that uncommon for that to happen in, uh, in the UK.

82
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,480
Okay. So, uh, had that one to the list.

83
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,920
We've got typhoons.

84
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,960
I want to thank, uh, let me see, who was at Jason Smith who sent in that song, uh,

85
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,800
Johnny Sonic Pacell's Euros.

86
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,640
And you could find that on the Podsafe Music Network.

87
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,920
Of course, links to that in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

88
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,240
Oh, man, I'm telling you.

89
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,040
So it's, uh, even though it's been a short week that I've been here since I didn't

90
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,600
even tell Tuesday, it feels like I've been here for a month.

91
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,320
Cricky, really, really busy. Yes, I, you know, I was so tired every single night, uh,

92
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,240
when I get back, um, there's a stuff that I, that I do for, uh, for serious.

93
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,160
Because, you know, we have, uh, four hours every single day, and, uh, we do promos.

94
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,360
And all kinds of different stuff. And so I typically do that last second one.

95
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,000
I just stir my, uh, tea here.

96
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,640
Uh, I was so tired that I recorded them last night.

97
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,880
And I was convinced that I had transferred this file onto the server for Peter up to get in the

98
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:51,720
morning, because he gets up around six o'clock, uh, a, uh, Eastern time, uh, because he's in, uh,

99
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,520
in Florida. And, you know, he starts to put in stuff together. And, um, and so I woke up this morning at

100
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,440
630, uh, Pacific Standard Time. And, uh, the first thing I do is, you know, my eyes open, okay,

101
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:09,400
it lights on, uh, let's see. And then I usually, literally, uh, not within, uh, you know, within a minute

102
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,520
of waking up. I start checking email, because I've just, you know, the engine runs. The

103
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,160
brains go and I'm, I'm moving while I'm getting my first cup of tea and all that. I see an email

104
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,000
from Peter up and he says, wow, it'd be really cool to be starting on stuff. But, uh, he'd been

105
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,800
waiting for like two and a half, three hours. Uh, I, I, I thought I had transferred it. It literally

106
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,320
was just sitting there. The, uh, the folder of the, of the server, the FTP server was going to send

107
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,520
it was, uh, was open. I guess I just never made the drag. Oh, man.

108
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,280
Uh, really exciting stuff to work on this weekend. Now I'm going to go to Los Angeles Sunday

109
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,760
afternoon for a couple of days, Ron and I are going to go because we've got, uh, uh, and now we've

110
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,880
got some meetings in Hollywood, baby. And we're going to hook up with, uh, you know, with people

111
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,760
that who've been working with in the LA area, uh, Mark Giorgio Motornemkov. I, I hope you're going

112
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,360
to have time to see Marcus couch as well. You know, we're going to, it's really, really busy.

113
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,120
So I'm sure we'll never even get, uh, three quarters of the people that we're supposed to be

114
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,080
seeing, but, uh, I'm going to be there for a couple of days coming back Tuesday night, uh, but

115
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:17,080
this weekend Saturday, I have all Saturday planned because Cas Blaster Mike, uh, who, as you

116
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:23,000
know, is the, uh, is the developer of Cas Blaster. And it's the, the program that I've been using

117
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,080
for. I should tell you that up, I must be several hundred episodes at this point. I've been

118
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:33,800
using it to, uh, to produce the daily source code. He has created video blaster. I'm not sure

119
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:40,280
I like the name, by the way. I, I, I still like Cas Blaster video, but it doesn't matter, um, and

120
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:46,760
it's essentially the same concept only for video. And he sent me an alpha version yesterday. Dude,

121
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,040
I got to tell you, this is like a fucking revolution. It is exactly the software that I've been looking

122
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,600
for. Um, now I got to play with it some more, but, but really what you fire it up, it's just like

123
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,080
Cas Blaster, where you can load in clips. And by the way, it can be Windows Media, it can be quick

124
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,240
time. It can be an MT4, even flash. You load that up into little players. And then you, you know,

125
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,440
you can select cameras. You can have multiple cameras. Uh, now I have a built-in camera on my Sony

126
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,640
via, uh, it founded immediately, but you can also switch between cameras. If you had another USB or

127
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:24,440
Firewire based video device, or any other type of video input I presume. And, and you just switch

128
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,600
back and forth. And, you, you play a clip and it automatically plays the clip and it switches the

129
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:34,360
camera off. And, and, and, and at the end, it poops out an MP4 file. It's like, yes, this is exactly

130
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,760
what I've been waiting for. And of course, you know, the, the step after that will be, uh, direct

131
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,440
upload to the, uh, to the podcast delivery network. Uh, so I can't wait to tell you more about that

132
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,800
on Monday. Uh, and Mike said I could talk about it as long as I didn't give out the link to the

133
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:55,800
alpha version. Yeah, duh, that makes sense. Uh, let me see. Yeah, thank you all so much for sending

134
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:01,640
information on, uh, on the, uh, the road tax thing that I'm trying to figure out in the UK. Of course,

135
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,840
I'm, I'm here. So there's not much I can do about it. And, um, and Patricia doesn't know where

136
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,360
all the paperwork is. And it probably honestly, that's not her. She shouldn't have to worry about

137
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,880
that. This is my crap that I have to deal with. And, uh, and, and, and as simple as it should be to

138
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:22,920
be able to essentially pay road tax, I can't even get a straight answer out of my friends in the UK.

139
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:30,760
Hey Adam, Mike here from Fishball Acoustic. How's it going? Logbooks. What are they? Well,

140
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,160
you don't need to worry. There's nothing too complicated. You don't have to keep a log of how many

141
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,200
hours you drive and what you do with the car and all that kind of rubbish. All it is, it's a, it's a,

142
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:47,160
a name for the vehicle registration document, which is a document that, uh, every car, every registered

143
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:53,400
car has. Um, I think that the number of it is V5C or something like that. But basically, it's a

144
00:11:53,400 --> 00:12:00,280
registration document that just says, uh, your car's make it's color. It's, uh, year registration,

145
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:06,280
registration number, chassis number, you know, stuff like that. And, uh, that's it, basically. So you

146
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:11,880
should have one of those for your car. All you need to do is to pop it in the envelope with the rest of

147
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:19,160
the crap that you sent to the vehicle registration, um, people and then Bob should be your mother's brother.

148
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,000
Tailwinds, right? Yeah. I don't, I don't know if I want Bob to be my mother's brother.

149
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,760
That doesn't sound right. Okay. Now, first of all, I, no, and I don't, I don't want to delve

150
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:38,440
in it too, too deeply, but a log book that doesn't sound like the description of a log book

151
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:43,640
what you did. Sounds like a, um, a registration is not what that is. It's a registration document,

152
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,880
which, as far as I could tell, was not required as for the documents. I even know what the

153
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:53,000
fucking registration thing looks like. Now, listen to Adrian Pegg, who's, I think a guy who's pretty

154
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,480
much together. And he tried to explain it. Hi, Adam, it's Adrian Pax from London. Uh, without going into too

155
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,440
much detail, I'm boring, everybody rigid with a road taxi in the UK. I just thought I'd try and explain

156
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:11,240
you very quickly. Um, the taxi represents the, well, it's actually called a road fund license.

157
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,840
It, it, uh, it's, it's, it's effectively the money to go to the government, to pay for the

158
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:23,240
upkeep of the roads in the UK. And, uh, road users have to have, um, uh, a taxi in order to legally

159
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:31,080
use the road. So, uh, simple really. In order to buy a taxi, uh, you have to have a couple of things.

160
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,520
You have to have a valid insurance for your car. And if your car is more than three years old,

161
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:42,040
you have to have an MOT certificate, which is, which is, as you, uh, correct the guest is a mystery

162
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:48,440
of transport test, which is, um, uh, only applies to cars of, of vehicles that are older than three

163
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,280
years. Um, and this is where the vehicle is tested for those things, including, uh, you know,

164
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,200
like some breaks and tires and stuff like that. Um, so the whole thing is tied together so that

165
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,320
you, you can only buy the taxi's completely on the road if you've got those other two bits.

166
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,280
And I think the, um, there might be some confusion, but I thought your Jag was in New Jag,

167
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:17,160
which case it won't be needing an MOT for another couple of years. Um, so that's that, um,

168
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:25,160
um, and the other thing that you mentioned was the, uh, logo, would you actually, uh,

169
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,800
like a receipt for a car release, sort of, it's a document, a little document that goes along with

170
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,160
the ownership of that vehicle, uh, have all the details about previous owners and, uh, uh,

171
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:42,680
where the cars, the, you know, and, uh, and so on. Um, why are you being up sending the logo, uh,

172
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,880
I can't imagine unless there's some confusion as a Y, um, over the MOT thing. That's, um,

173
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,720
I'm not sure they're confusing. It's typical British beer. Oh, yeah, yeah. Anyway, take care,

174
00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:00,120
keep on the good work. Exactly. This is what I don't, I don't understand. Why do I have an MOT certificate?

175
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:06,520
The car's not three years old. I've had it for a year. Yeah, uh, uh, uh, my dealer, um,

176
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,920
you know, it was time for the annual on the car. So I, you know, they picked the car up. They

177
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
pretended to do something. They throws, you know, they take the older oil out. They put new oil in.

178
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,560
They charge a 200 pounds. And I know how that works. And, but they also gave me an MOT certificate.

179
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:26,280
Why are they testing the car? It doesn't need not to be tested. Why does, uh, motor vehicles,

180
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:32,200
or whoever, whatever the department's name is, why are they asking for this stuff? And, and if,

181
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,320
if I'm the original owner of the car, do I even have a logbook?

182
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:43,000
Ah, thank God we have this song. And now we're from our sponsor. It's the yanks versus the brits.

183
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,480
We'll try to be sure the crazy, but everybody knows that it's a parent to see.

184
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:57,240
Let just like you and me, it's the yanks and the brits you to add down. The yanks versus the brits.

185
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,880
Mind the gap. If you're sitting there in the UK thinking, oh, I know what the answer is.

186
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,960
Please feel free to use our UK-based phone line to leave your message about the case.

187
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,240
That might as well do the US numbers. Well, uh, because, uh, I think the brits have the

188
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,680
yanks this week on phone calls.

189
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,360
David Longley sent something in for today's football festivities, which I thought was a very

190
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,080
interesting idea and good experiment. I want to try with you right now. So he says,

191
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:59,160
yeah, you know, sure you have various jingles that that help people remember the phone numbers when

192
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,600
they want to call in to the daily source code. However, he says, I've got something that could be

193
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:09,560
even better. Now, this will only work as far as I know for people, uh, senseo. Excuse me.

194
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,840
It's will only work for people who have, uh, are listening to the show on speakers or on a

195
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:20,120
headset that you could wrap around the mouth piece of your phone. He said, why don't we try and, uh,

196
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:25,560
and give out the actual DMTF tones. So instead of you dialing, all you have to do now is now pick up

197
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,360
your phone. If you need to get an outside line, you want to hit the outside line code first. Now,

198
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,000
put the mouthpiece of the phone up to the speaker or into the headphones if you're listening on

199
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:46,280
headphones. And let's see if this works. So that would be the UK number. Did it work? Okay,

200
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:51,960
yank, standby. Put your phone's mouthpiece right up there to the to the speakers. Ready?

201
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,800
Let's see if we can dial into the Jersey number.

202
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,320
I think, and if this works, I have a great idea. If this works, we can do the

203
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:09,320
surprise phone line of the day. And, and I will, uh, I'll give you the tones and it'll dial and

204
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,960
you'll see what it is. I mean, something that we should, uh, experiment with. Now,

205
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,520
I'm not going to tell you who this is until after the song, but it is from the late 60s,

206
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:25,800
early 70s, and you do know the artist. I wish you were the fisherman. I wish you were a king.

207
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,200
A fisherman's mom has a good love. She keeps the cabin clean.

208
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:52,120
And there is nothing wrong with you, they love you.

209
00:18:52,120 --> 00:19:08,120
The queen is a hover. She has changed.

210
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:26,120
She keeps the jay money. She keeps the jay money.

211
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:37,160
I am for the man who walks in the sun to let's die.

212
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:49,640
And there is nothing wrong with you.

213
00:19:49,640 --> 00:20:07,320
I wish you were a fisherman. I wish you were a king.

214
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:22,280
King's what has a good love. She never does a thing.

215
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:33,320
And there is nothing wrong with you.

216
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:57,240
Now, it's not possible, but I think we can get this song on the pod save music network.

217
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:05,240
If anyone was interested in it, which I like it. I have not heard this song in, uh, I got to say at least 10

218
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:16,040
years. This is that. I think it is 30 or 35 years old, as you can tell from that real 60s kind of echo chamber.

219
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,240
You know, I'm not going to tell you who that is. Why don't you, why don't you give it a guess?

220
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,840
Call into the phone line number in the voicemail. Let's see if you can figure it out.

221
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:31,560
Some of you may already, I've given enough clues and hints already, but I have not. That is, I love that song.

222
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,720
It's just as good as the first time I heard it. Hello! Hello!

223
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,240
Hey, tractor two times! You got way too much time on your hands, my friend.

224
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:20,680
Yeah, what's up AC? This is Jersey Todd, the official nighted music college of the

225
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,320
Chacha. Dude, did you spend some time in West Virginia a few years back? Well, you know,

226
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,880
when I used to think about West Virginia, I used to think about coal miners, some beautiful

227
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:35,320
country, maybe the Appalachian Trail, a C++ college football team, except not anymore did,

228
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,560
not anymore, and neither will you, because today on the Delhi source code, I'm bringing

229
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:45,320
you a band that from now on will make you associate West Virginia with the best cleavage on the

230
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,440
pot-safe music network, and some kick-ass rock and roll. The band is hydrogen,

231
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:57,160
now West Virginia, their song is blind, and oh my god, she can sing to check this out.

232
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:22,760
I'm a fool like you want to fame, I just do the thing, and you know that it's too

233
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:31,640
I want to want you want to, when you want to, it's just another day.

234
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,880
No more time, I can tell, break my plans and I'm in the end, cause I'm giving in.

235
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:49,800
I'm gonna say, couldn't be just the same as the same thing, we will wait to see you.

236
00:23:51,160 --> 00:24:01,720
I'm gonna follow you in the night, but will you just go by my grind?

237
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:10,360
I'm gonna go by my grind, and if you want more now to lie,

238
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,000
I'm gonna go by my grind, and if you want more now to lie, and if you want more now to lie,

239
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'm gonna go by my grind, and if you want more now to lie, and if you want more now to lie,

240
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,480
what am you doing?

241
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,000
When you're kyooing 23 when you say am I listening?

242
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,840
I'm not listening!

243
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,320
Take the ball, take the place, take it all, just prepare to pay,

244
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,840
cause you don't go.

245
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,600
Now more, follow you in the night,

246
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,840
and, most importantly, just customize.

247
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:32,840
I want my love you will find

248
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:40,840
I want you just to find my grace

249
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:48,840
There's no one more right on the other side

250
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:56,840
God I think I'm so weird

251
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,840
Oh, time man

252
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,840
Now that's football, stop

253
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,840
It's food for the football

254
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,840
I think I'm going there

255
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,840
Damn, hydrogen from West Virginia

256
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,840
Fly high, fly blind blind

257
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,840
Her name is Julie Todd

258
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,840
I'm looking at the picture right now

259
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,840
at

260
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,840
Potshow.com slash music

261
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,840
Oh my god

262
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,840
Dude, you are so rough

263
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,840
I think I'm in love again

264
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,840
I don't know who this is

265
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,840
but stop fucking calling Disneyland toll

266
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,840
Yeah, I did go to school in West Virginia

267
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,840
and West Virginia is pretty cool

268
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,840
You forgot to mention moonshine

269
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,840
There's another thing West Virginia's got going for it

270
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,840
Yep, now I've seen this, I've seen this type of specimen in West Virginia

271
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,840
Mm-hmm

272
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
Damn

273
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,840
That's the read from the bio here fortified with cutting edge riffs

274
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,840
Intelligent lyrics and massive hooks delivered by Julie

275
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,840
Just Julie, a stunning front lady with a multi-active range

276
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,840
The result as a formula set to conquer everything from alternative rock to modern hard rock

277
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,840
To timeless metal without sacrificing credibility

278
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,840
I don't know what all I mean

279
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,840
Is man, you guys kick ass

280
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,840
Damn, they have another song on P.M.N.

281
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,840
Hold on, let me see

282
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,840
Break and be down, let me listen to that one for a second

283
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,840
They were both uploaded two days ago

284
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,840
Let's see if that one sounds like for a second

285
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840
Oh, it's the ballad, of course

286
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,840
Do you mind if we just listen for a second

287
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
Because

288
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,840
Is Julie is very talented

289
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,840
I bet you this one kicks into it

290
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,840
I'm like a major fucking overdrive

291
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,840
These guys are great

292
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,840
It does take me back to my days in West Virginia

293
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,840
Only about three months worth of for I quit school

294
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,840
I didn't know what the hell I was doing there

295
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,840
Oh, she's seems beautiful

296
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:02,840
I just gave the illusion

297
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,840
Oh, oh, oh

298
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,840
Shit, okay, we'll do that on your own time

299
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,840
Go listen to that

300
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,840
Links at the show know it's a daily source code dot com

301
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Last night only in America ladies and gentlemen

302
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,840
No Gibson was on the tonight show

303
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,840
And he got nothing but applause

304
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,840
It was great

305
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,840
This is what a great country America is

306
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,840
First you can get kicked down, stomped into the mud

307
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,840
Whether it was deserved or not is is

308
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,840
You know, I think it was of course it was deserved

309
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,840
But it has nothing to do with it

310
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,840
For whatever reason you get stomped down kicked in the mud

311
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,840
Drag through it

312
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,840
And there was talk of Mel Gibson never working again in Hollywood

313
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,840
And yesterday he comes in this night show

314
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,840
And it's like, you know, I said, man, I fucked up

315
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,840
He didn't actually actually say that

316
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,840
But I fucked up, you know, I straightened up, I moved on

317
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,840
And I've got to face it

318
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,840
And that was, it was such the right thing

319
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840
He said the audience went wild

320
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,840
And his new movie opens up tonight, how convenient

321
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

322
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,840
All right, let's see

323
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,840
I see there's anything else like a talk to you about stuff that we're doing

324
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,840
You know, you should definitely be on the lookout for changes

325
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,840
On the plus podjo, plus podjo.com

326
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,840
Because every single day there's new changes coming out

327
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,840
The dashboard is now functioning

328
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,840
The collection stuff has all been cleared up

329
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,840
The program guide is about to change

330
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,840
There's so many, so many things that are just now just rolling out

331
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,840
One after another

332
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,840
Now that we kind of have a shit together

333
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,840
And I'm really feeling damn good about it

334
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,840
Also, yesterday I got a demo of

335
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,840
The next version of our IPTV interface

336
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,840
This is the stuff that will work on the set top box

337
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,840
Oh, man, it's so awesome for video and for audio

338
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,840
And not just that, but it's, you know,

339
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,840
Imagine if you imagine if you will

340
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
In a world where you could take

341
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,840
You know, your, your hot people, your hot music, your hot videos, your hot shows,

342
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,840
All the stuff that you like, your channels

343
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,840
And you could have those all in your television

344
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,840
But really could navigate it with a remote control

345
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,840
Easily

346
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,840
Oh, man, you're going to love this

347
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,840
I know you are

348
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,840
Coming soon to a set top box near you

349
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,840
Adam, it's Bernie from Bernie's world

350
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,840
And I haven't sent you a tune in a little while

351
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,840
For just the right tune for a food bar Friday

352
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,840
And I think this is the one

353
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,840
It just hit the pod save music network

354
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840
It's by a band called WW3

355
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,840
I'm not going to give up the title because you're going to get it from the tune

356
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,840
But trust me, it's a lot of fun

357
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,840
It's perfect for a food bar Friday

358
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,840
Sabrina, it's Sabrina, check it out

359
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
My new t-shirt

360
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,840
Oh my god, am I got you?

361
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,840
Look, right

362
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
Like I know, I know

363
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
Yeah

364
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,840
Wait, what's going to wreck

365
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,840
Oh, I don't know

366
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,840
I think I'm going to rip the collar off it

367
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
Oh my god

368
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,840
Oh my god

369
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,840
I cut the glass

370
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,840
I skipped school

371
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
I hold that

372
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
To sleep out

373
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,840
In the parking lot of coconuts

374
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,840
Where they had the tickets on

375
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,840
Downward two of struck

376
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
Didn't view us on the show

377
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
The tape I like but I get knocked

378
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,840
Take the sounds

379
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,840
Take off your t-shirt

380
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,840
Miss Montelica

381
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,840
You were two years old

382
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,840
When ride the lightning came out

383
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,840
You felt no pain

384
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
My birds and dad

385
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,840
But she tried when they canceled

386
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,840
Baby, what's that?

387
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
You mess around with my pants

388
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840
Take off your t-shirt

389
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,840
Miss A, C, D, C

390
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
You don't even know

391
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
Hell's bells from a hate brain

392
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,840
You got that shirt

393
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,840
It's urban stuff, it's so cool

394
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,840
We've loads of bells

395
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,840
Just like we saw lunch

396
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,840

Take off your t-shirt

420
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,840
Do you remember the badminton guideLaughing

421
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:19,220
Hey, Lou

422
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,640
I mean you know they did not sing every rose as it's thorn

423
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,240
The sheep must be short, take off your day shit

424
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,840
Or you're in me, the number of the beans was not six

425
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,440
Six, seven!

426
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,840
I'd like to learn about what's happened from you

427
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,240
But they can't play them all in TV

428
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,240
Time to take off your day shit

429
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,040
Take off your day shit

430
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,240
Take off your day shit

431
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,640
You can't hear me song for the band

432
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,840
That's on it, take off your day shit

433
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,440
Take off your day shit

434
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,240
Take off your day shit

435
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,640
To the waste they get off beyond

436
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,640
It's you can't hear me song for the band that's on it

437
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,240
Still so crisp from the hanging on the rack

438
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,440
This t-shirt stretched across your back

439
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,840
It says nothing of the sacrifice

440
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,440
Through a thick end then

441
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,040
When snow and ice did I throw at the last lens

442
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,640
This one on the red of our sand cotton shield

443
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,440
Now face the face

444
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,840
And shard to shard its revamp

445
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,840
Your act on red song's weight rack

446
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,840
What you let them be

447
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,240
Cause they belong to mine

448
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,040
Take off your day shit

449
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,640
Take off your day shit

450
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,240
Take off your day shit

451
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,840
Can't hear me song for the band that's on it

452
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,440
Take off your day shit

453
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,040
Take off your day shit

454
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,840
Take off your day shit

455
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,840
It says molly hatch人

456
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,240
Show your feeling

457
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,440
This is a waste they get off beyond

458
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,340
Is you can's some for the band

459
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,840
That song you don't know the guy is printed on your garbage

460
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,840
Take off your T-shirt

461
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,520
If you can't name a song but the band that's on it,

462
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,800
duh, Bernie, thank you so much, man.

463
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,680
Awesome song to wrap up a football Friday at least

464
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,780
in the daily source code.

465
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,600
And of course you can find out one on the Pot tape

466
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,180
using them, Seanout, say that is rosecode.com.

467
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,720
I'm not saying it's a today.

468
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,820
It's Friday!

469
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,760
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday,

470
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,800
football Friday and a spinal fun on the week.

471
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,780
Nothing really, uh, all that pro-found for you today.

472
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,420
Other than I've just been thinking about the world in general.

473
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,040
You know, nothing too heavy.

474
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,280
And I'd say, uh, the, uh,

475
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,880
there are two things that I'm really noticing.

476
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,560
The one thing is, if you look around, uh,

477
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,520
and everywhere in mainstream media, people are being laid off.

478
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,680
We're seeing this happen at clear channel now that they know

479
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,400
they're being broken up and, uh,

480
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,000
and take in private, which of course is basically the end

481
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,840
of that company.

482
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,400
It will be split into little 80-bitty parts.

483
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,200
Um, we see journalists being let go.

484
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,160
But in our world, we're hiring.

485
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,400
And it's great because there's a total,

486
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,040
I can now almost visualize the talent as it just flows

487
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,080
from mainstream media into the next wave of media.

488
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,040
I'm not going to say we're new media because we're here

489
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,800
and we're kicking ass.

490
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,000
And along with that goes, um, and this is, you know,

491
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,120
I just been thinking about the, the zoom a lot.

492
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,600
Thinking about, wow, you know,

493
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,160
what, why did Microsoft make some of the decisions it's made?

494
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,440
I think probably the most promising thing

495
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,480
that we were all, we collectively were probably the most

496
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,920
upset about those of us who really care is that, uh,

497
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,520
although the device has Wi-Fi built into it,

498
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,760
it doesn't really function the way we expected to.

499
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,560
And I think we could take that a little bit further

500
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,640
because what I'm seeing now with all these different networks

501
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,000
providing connectivity from the cellular phone companies

502
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,160
to Wi-max, uh, to some version of universal Wi-Fi,

503
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,360
which of course doesn't really work.

504
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,320
That kind of got fucked up somewhere along the way

505
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,960
in all the, all the agreements of how Wi-Fi is supposed to work.

506
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,120
I think that we're going to see handheld devices

507
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,600
that'll just be like radios that will just pick up a signal.

508
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,720
Now we still have some work to do on battery life.

509
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,720
This, this Wi-Fi shit really can drain your battery.

510
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,280
Although I gotta tell you that Nokia E61, I'm still loving it.

511
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,920
It's holding a quite fine with Wi-Fi being on and used all day long.

512
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,360
So it, it does get me through an entire day.

513
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:36,160
So I think that, you know, if you just take away the knowledge

514
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,720
of how all the protocols and how all the wireless should work

515
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,200
to the, you know, on the back end and just think about, you know,

516
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,880
normal folks, just joblo picking up some device

517
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,840
and all of a sudden, you know, there's like television on it,

518
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,800
except it's not a network that is like ABC, NBC, CBS or Fox

519
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,680
or is there another network?

520
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,160
And, you know, there's like radio on it,

521
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,200
but it's not really radio.

522
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,560
It's, well, hold on, you can listen to stuff live

523
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,880
and you can also make sure that show is always ready there

524
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,840
and waiting for you.

525
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,160
I think we're going into a fantastic new world.

526
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,080
And I'm seeing devices coming out now,

527
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:15,400
it's gonna be in 2007 and I'll probably do a whole year wrap up

528
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,680
and oh, let's do some predictions as well before the end of the year.

529
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,160
Because I think that we're gonna see some really radical changes

530
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:27,320
that will actually take us back 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years in time

531
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,080
and what the most interesting thing will be

532
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,800
is to see how legislation is going to be adapted to that.

533
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,160
It's not much, but it is my final thought for the week.

534
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,480
I'm gonna do some mistakes.

535
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,480
There's a fool about Friday and I'm spinal thought on the week.

536
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,400
Oh, okay, everybody.

537
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,040
Well, I want to thank you so much for listening

538
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,520
as I said, I'll be playing this weekend

539
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,120
with Cas Blaster video or Vitt Caster.

540
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,720
I can't, Cas Blaster, I see V, I just, it rolls nice.

541
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,120
Cas Blaster video.

542
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,080
Please send in your openers.

543
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,720
Do not send a five, 12 for me

544
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,920
because I've got one from Pdo,

545
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,840
which is a very good one.

546
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,400
It's a real tin foil hat moment opener.

547
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,360
If you've got other openers, send them along.

548
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,080
Starting at five, 13 as far as you want to go.

549
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,440
Even if I get duplicates, you know.

550
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,120
I pretty much always use them.

551
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,440
