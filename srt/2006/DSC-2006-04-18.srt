I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You threw up just this much.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You'd be flying a cargo plane full of rubber dogs here.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And different from the way I was before.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
To grab the brush and let's your glory for now.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Call of me outside outside the light.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You don't need to realize I am defined.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Take me beyond all the things that I know.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
To call of me outside outside the light.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Well yeah.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Call of me when I'm so black and white.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Reflections of your mercy.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Reflections of your side.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I know I need something different from the way I was before.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
To grab the brush and let's your glory for now.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Call of me outside outside the light.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You don't need to realize I am defined.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Take me beyond all the things that I know.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
To call of me outside outside the light.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And different from the way I was before.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You don't need to realize I am defined.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I have to search you for closer and more.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And deep in my hair light.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm there.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But four, one, one.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,280
me outside the lines in the pod save music network actually a submission from a listener

37
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,320
from David Peterson who says a friend of mine has a band. This is how it usually goes with

38
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,000
the pod save music. I convinced him to let me set up a page form on the pod save music network.

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,240
The band is called 10th Hour Calling. Leave singers been safer and they've received some local

40
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,800
radio play. Most people like Colour Me in Ancient Butterfly. That's why I played Colour Me. I like

41
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,640
the two of them and very much. Thank you Dave Peterson. You can find David dipstick.com and 10th Hour

42
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:23,320
Calling at the pod save music network. Hey everybody it's Tuesday and I have a horrible confession

43
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:30,600
to make. I'm addicted. That's right. My name is Adam Curry and I am addicted to second life.

44
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:39,240
Have you ever seen this game? This stuff. It literally is crack for your mind man. I'm telling you

45
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,680
this is a I've heard a lot about it. I've seen people blog about it. I never really have been into

46
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,640
gaming at all. I'm totally not even flight simulators about the the farthest I'll get into gaming.

47
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,080
Which of course is pretty advanced and not really gaming. But the second life it's if you've ever

48
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:02,520
read the book Metaverse by Neil Stephenson which is a book I think I read in 1993 maybe a little

49
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,680
late in that maybe it was 94 somewhere around there. This is exactly what the book describes.

50
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:15,400
The Metaverse is this place where you jack in and now we're jacking in now through laptops and

51
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,120
desktop computers and through screens but on the on the Metaverse which is really not that far

52
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,560
fetch you put on goggles to jack into the system. I can't wait to build a sense say oh,

53
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:32,280
shack in the second life. But you get an avatar. You look like a person and you can dress yourself

54
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:39,000
and it's a real world that's going on in there. It's unbelievable and I don't think even though

55
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,880
this was these ideas have been talked about and conceived of for decades really it hasn't been

56
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,240
until now we have all the connections we have the internet everyone can get online. It works for Windows

57
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:56,200
and for Mac I was happy to see and you can actually you know create a second life. The name is

58
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:02,040
extremely appropriate and I was just blown away by this. Also my computers were blown away.

59
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,960
Gosh man that stuff really it really harshes the process. But you know you're downloading

60
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:14,440
worlds and you can teleport to places and you can hug people and wave and talk and chat and then

61
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,240
you can pick up all these gestures and objects and of course there's an incredible thriving

62
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:27,160
adult community in this in second life and they have a currency which actually translates to dollars

63
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:35,000
it's crazy. You should check it out secondlife.com and you know the thing I was and I definitely

64
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,920
want to investigate this a more but I have to be very very careful because it's so easy to sit

65
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,480
down behind the computer log in and before you know it three hours have passed. What I'd like to

66
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:50,040
do is I'd like to build a podcast shack you know a little place out by the sea maybe where I live

67
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,920
in the shack and then I have a hole in the ground and underneath is where I have my my evil

68
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,960
podshow podshack empire instead of high on a hill I want to be down below and it would be great

69
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,160
if people would come up and you could you could get a podcast right from the shack. I mean there's

70
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,320
all kinds of stuff streaming video streaming audio works in these worlds so I'm sure there should

71
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:16,920
be a way to exchange podcasts and maybe even build an aggregator build a pod catcher right into

72
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,760
second life. It's just some thoughts man but wow I was completely blown away.

73
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:27,960
Um my uh what is my name in second life? Oh Adam Newman with double end. It's funny when you

74
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,320
sign up you get to use your real first name but they assign you a choice of last name so that's

75
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,560

wants me to go to the garden center yeah the weather's nice here spring is finally arrived

94
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,520
blossoms are a blossoming and that means it's time for me to go slip all kinds of plants and

95
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,960
crap and bring them back to the cottage it's not my favorite past time but I got to do that

96
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,880
before 4 p.m. right now it's already after one again second life is is to blame for that

97
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,560
reason being we're getting the dev cast set up now I'd said that I'd hope to have that

98
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,960
up last night UK time but I think something with a DNS that wasn't propagating properly

99
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,720
anyway by the time you hear this you're probably be able to go to devcast.podshow.com

100
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:21,640
that's dv delta vector vico cast dot pod show dot com and that's where you can subscribe if you

101
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,360
are developer if you know some HTML and PHP then you'll be able to get into pod show plus

102
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,480
and the podcast little re network start helping us out create stuff there's actually some

103
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,280
some ways for you to help us and get paid for it and all of that will be explained in the dev

104
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:41,880
cast of the SDK and all that stuff can have Andrew explain that to you and Kevin and I think

105
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:48,680
we'll probably do hopefully I'll get to dev cast out this week and included in every single one

106
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:54,200
of the dev cast will be golden tickets we're going to try and get 50 people in at first glance

107
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,920
and judging from the g-mails have gotten on the topic it won't be much of a problem so

108
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,120
stay tuned for dev cast dot pod show dot com and we'll see you on the other side of the fire wall

109
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:17,960
Metro sexual metro sexual metro sexual metro sexual it's an encourage metro sexual moment

110
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,960
and carries metro sexual moment yeah no just kind of a disturbing trend when it comes

111
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:32,200
to metro sexuality apparently this word metro sexual is now on every single outlist or every

112
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:37,640
in and outlist on the outside that would be on the lame side that I've seen anywhere in the United

113
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:43,400
States I don't get it it's like okay maybe the label metro sexual doesn't fit anymore but the

114
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:53,560
the act of it you know as to post a being big macho man that seems to be still going strong just

115
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,920
you're not allowed to call yourself a metro sexual anymore well I'm sorry I'm going to fight it

116
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,480
tooth and nail we're going to remain metro sexual here as we pendelled back and forth between the

117
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,200
US and the UK apparently though according to Paul Nairick Nairink who sent me

118
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,720
the way he emailed this link was pretty funny this article is pretty interesting regarding the

119
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,000
surgeon metro sexual behavior in Japan now it sounds like it's like we're sexual deviance

120
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,360
but there's a whole article and of course I will put a link in the show notes to it about

121
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,400
Ishi Toko who's one of a growing number of Japanese men investing time and money to approve their

122
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:34,600
appearance for them applying facial lotion and wearing nice clothes not just enough many are trying

123
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,080
things once the preserve of women manicures spot treatments even underwear their enhances the

124
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:45,960
body shape or gaining popularity I yes so we have to go to Asia all right I have a feeling that

125
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:52,200
Tokyo Dan might be checking in on this topic any other listeners in any other listeners

126
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:59,160
in Japan just let me know how what the state is of metro sexuality okay hey Adam just in here on

127
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,920
DSC 357 you were talking about a city that was using dog crap to generate power oh wait a minute

128
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,480
live in a small aggregate and it that's not a metro sexual content that get in there that's a

129
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:19,800
Trinity comment crap now I've really done it hold on afters for a second yeah all right then we'll

130
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,920
just try this one we'll do a two for one on this Tuesday that's what I need to produce her for

131
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,720
okay ready let's do it again hey Adam just in here on DSC 357 you were talking about a city

132
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,000
that was using dog crap to generate power a lot of in a small agricultural community and we've got

133
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,840
a similar system my town of Lyndon is surrounded by dairy farms a cows crap a lot more than dogs

134
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:00,280
so we got a lot of crap around here recently Washington state's first methane digester

135
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:06,680
was installed at a local farm it takes the ways from about 1500 cows and turns it into electricity

136
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:12,920
which is then added to the local power company's grid it provides enough power to fuel 180 homes

137
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,960
and that's just from a fraction of the cow crap we got around here anyway thought this might

138
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:23,640
be an interesting addition to your dialogue of alternative energy thanks Adam bye oh dude thank you

139
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:29,480
and of course this immediately raises the question if it works with cow crap will it work with

140
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:37,160
human crap just imagine the possibilities of heating your home with your own produce

141
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,680
yeah I just wanted to talk one second about this whole notion of quiet birth and I'm reading

142
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:00,920
more about it which is why I want to pick it up as a thread here on the Charlie this is being promoted

143
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:08,200
by Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes and it seems like everyone is writing about this what is this this

144
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:14,360
is the Chicago Sun Times I guess mainly mainstream and I just wanted to want to stop for

145
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,520
second and talk about it because what is very apparent to me now this is all a part of

146
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:24,440
Scientology the concept of a quiet birth maybe I should tell you what it what actually is now

147
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,080
wait a minute here's the here's the thing the bothers me about most of these articles it's

148
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:38,040
apparent to me that almost no one has actually read the book dynamics by El Ron Hubbard who was the

149
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,720
father of Scientology and the brains behind it and who I truly believe had a bet with some

150
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,840
buddy in a bar it said hey dude I bet you I can become the Messiah with my own religion and then

151
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:55,960
all of a sudden he did it based on a book but you know reading through the book you know you think

152
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,760
that you know based upon these what are those things they have those testers your stressometer

153
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:07,880
and you know and and of course the horrible stories about who about the the cultish nature of

154
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,600
the the Church of Scientology you know I read the book and I was pretty disappointed because there's

155
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:18,920
no cultism in there at all there was quite a bit in fact most of the book is about you know

156
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,960
childhood and how it affects behavior and I found it to be quite entertaining I read this book I think

157
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:31,240
three maybe yeah three years ago probably on a vacation in Jamaica and that's probably why most

158
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,840
journalists haven't read this book because if you if you've seen it laying around in a bookstore it's huge

159
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:43,400
it is a it is a big ass paperback book I'm sure you can get the hardbound copy but you know it's

160
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:49,240
it's quite a it's quite a read that you have to commit to to get through it all but the whole concept

161
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,960
of quiet birth is not all that stupid actually and they go into into great depth about you know

162
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,960
the trauma how how an unborn child even can be traumatized by loud noises by bumping etc

163
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:10,360
and how that can affect hearing and sight and general attitude and I thought it was some pretty

164
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,760
interesting things and there was some space outshed in there as well but I thought that almost seemed like

165
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:22,920
logical just logics and the quiet birth concept is that you don't talk and there's no screaming

166
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:29,560
or yelling during during the birthing process the same by the way goes for operations

167
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:36,120
and I'm seeing more articles about that as well that doctors if they were to follow

168
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:42,120
dynamics would say nothing during an operation where of course if you were watched you know ER or

169
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:51,080
what's the plastic surgery TV series can't remember you know that the people are talking

170
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,720
all kinds of trash and it's not like your ears are plugged up you know we really don't know a lot

171
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,280
about how much information gets into you while you're asleep or while you're in the subconscious

172
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:07,000
level apparently according to dynamics a lot does so you know this it doesn't seem weird to me

173
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,320
if anyone has any opinions on dynamics and and forget the church of Scientology because I don't

174
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,840
only want to get into that because I may be there totally misinterpreting what what El Ron

175
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,840
Hubbard meant to begin with I have no idea but the whole concept of what's in dynamics it's

176
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:29,320
pretty as I said pretty interesting and yeah and to me very normal stuff in there and and

177
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,200
and to with this journalist you know if you're gonna write about it don't just hop on the

178
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,720
the Tom Cruise bashing bandwagon he's no butt of mine but you know maybe read the book first

179
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,120
so you can write some informed articles you said I was not all over you know another hood

180
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:53,400
you know I got you ready yeah oh no I know this is a to the d to the a M U to man

00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,640
of radio stations that play music that's everything that's out they won't play the whole album but

see I'm slipping I promised I wouldn't do that anymore but I was totally blown away here

206
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:10,600
by the amount of podcasters that have played that song which one is it blow your whistle

207
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,200
let me just hear for a second I look like I play it yeah it looks like I played it on the source code as

208
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:23,320
well well know what that would happen there where to go come on yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

209
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:33,800
yeah I remember I remember you know it's important I'm trying to highlight all different

210
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,920
to genres of music to make sure that you know we're not just talking about potsafe music and

211
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:45,160
potsafe music showcases that are only for the rock alternative rock modern rock but also for

212
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:51,160
hip hop for R&B for blues country and western christian music we got to make sure we get it all out

213
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,360
there and I love the fact that these guys are trying to get some stuff into the clubs that's

214
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:02,280
very cool and just touching back briefly on and I posted a note to a link to a slate article

215
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:09,240
yesterday you know which of course related to that quote from AT&T CEO Whitaker who said that

216
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:17,320
he's going to make sure that you know big media companies who use their pipes quote on quote

217
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,600
will have to pay for it and what I'm seeing still is a lot of confusion from people saying

218
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,160
well I already pay thirty bucks a month I already have my ban how can I have to pay more let

219
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:33,080
let me just reset that for a second this will not directly concern you as a consumer

220
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,720
of course indirectly it will because if content companies have to pay extra money to get

221
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,200
high quality high definition whatever the hell is supposed to be done with with more pipes to get

222
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,440
that to you well you know something they're going to pass it on somewhere they'll pass it on

223
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,160
to advertise it advertise or pass it into the price of products and and round around she goes right

224
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,560
so it's not going to impact you directly this is this is something separate in fact I believe

225
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,440
I believe what what the what the what the big telcos and there's only a few now AT&T is

226
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:10,120
really so big I think you know sixty or sixty five percent of of all communications money spent

227
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:16,920
will go to AT&T in the United States at least oh man I'm sorry I'm gastronomic today

228
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:26,680
uh he's hydromatic and gastronomic gastromatic um I think that the AT&T guys are thinking that

229
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:31,960
they're going to connect these pipes to Hollywood so that you know they're all talking about movies

230
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:40,120
no one is talking about the upload the upload part gosh how hard is it to see that I think they're

231
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,040
all looking at iTunes and saying yeah yeah yeah we can make that successful we can we can do that

232
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:49,240
too but they don't understand that Apple is making money on selling iPods and Macintosh computers

233
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:56,760
not necessarily huge bundles of cash on on the music sales and then not doing too bad but it's

234
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:03,960
not like that's huge amounts of money it's just not if you're listening to this on uh Syria stars

235
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,760
102 you're going to have to download the whole show to listen to the rest of this thread this conversation

236
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,720
daily source code dot com what is coming up for you in just a couple seconds pch

239
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,200
i found not mistaken so that'll be a real treat that'll take you from nine to ten eastern

240
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:37,480
that is a six to uh was at six to seven uh pacific time and we'll be back with the hump day

241
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:42,920
addition of the daily source code right here tomorrow same time on Syria stars 102 so i'll catch

242
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:52,840
you guys then now back to our little story so it seems to me like the telcos and specifically

243
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:58,760
AT&T are trying to hook up you know fiber to the home and of course that has to be paid for you know

244
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,360
as someone has to pay for it and they're going to charge their customers and i think that they're

245
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:08,360
probably looking more towards Hollywood which i think will be a huge disappointment for them

246
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:17,320
and i certainly do not believe in the concept of uh routing information based upon priority which

247
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:23,800
is another big thing that you hear everyone talking about saying okay well so you know if you have

248
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:29,080
you'll have like the dirt road of the internet but if uh if you're content provider the person

249
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,240
you're getting the information from uh pays a premium or what some are calling attacks

250
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,000
in that case then your packets that actually come into your home or computer or whatever will

251
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,920
have some form of priority and they'll be delivered faster more reliably i mean but when you look at

252
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:50,840
all the information traveling on the on the net to actually put in place this could create a whole

253
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,440
new dot com bubble by itself just to have the machines powerful enough the routers powerful enough

254
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,960
to be able to segregate on an individual packet level what has to go where and what has a priority

255
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,760
i think and i'd be happy to pay for this by the way i think 30 bucks a month is a good deal

256
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:13,080
is cheap and i'll i'll pay 60 a month if you can give me a big honk and fat pipe and i'm sure

257
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:20,680
that um even as pod show we'd be happy to contribute if we had more bandwidth you know to uh and of

258
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,560
course we talked to through our pod cast delivery network you know we we remove much of the

259
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:32,680
public internet already if your pod cast is being requested uh through the pod cast delivery network

260
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:39,800
onto let's say a calm cast is your ISP that file that data does not travel any other route

261
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,760
then directly from the pod cast delivery network to the calm cast network it's called peering that's

262
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,640
the beauty of the network that we've set up so you don't traverse over any of the public portions

263
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,040
of the internet other than the ones that are directly involved in the request and the delivery of a

264
00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:00,760
file so to have more uh capability at that connection yeah right on so i'm not totally against it

265
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:07,640
what i am seeing though is this wittaker guy he can't buy the right PR he really really really

266
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,880
messed it up with that statement and uh and he's gonna have to put i think he's gonna have to show

267
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,880
what he's talking about before people understand it and he's gonna do something quick they're talking

268
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,760
2008 when they want to have some of this in place which seems very quick to me but he's gonna have to

269
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:28,440
show what he really means and he's gonna have to get some partners who are going to stand next to him

270
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,560
and explain it otherwise this will just result in oh man everyone's jumping on this and i think

271
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,960
it's just purely because it's it's being poorly explained and he probably doesn't understand what he's

272
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:46,200
talking about either which is not a typical of of a huge company CEOs um i and i'm not too sure of

273
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:51,000
his background but i don't know if he really understands all of what he's talking about but for now

274
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,840
i wouldn't be too worried about it i see it really is okay bigger pipes on the way i hope i hope

275
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:03,080
and i really pray that someone thinks about giving the upload portion a little more attention you know

276
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,800
we need to be able to distribute stuff out he's got to push stuff up that's where it's all going

277
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:13,400
to come from it's the same thing with second life you know second life is a fantastic game engine

278
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:19,720
and the people in it build the whole network i mean you can't have any better example of of how

279
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:25,320
media is being and the second life to me is 100% media you can't you can't build any better

280
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:31,880
example and by the way hey how would you like to have more bandwidth for your second life connection huh

281
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:38,040
mm-hmm and congratulations to Steve runner he made it he completed the Boston marathon

282
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:45,080
it was so cool to see uh these automatic emails coming in here's the last one i got at

283
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:53,960
617 pm Stephen Walker i should say Steve runner has finished pace 7 minutes and 55 seconds per

284
00:28:53,960 --> 00:29:01,800
kilometer finish time 533 42 and Steve bought me off notice it was an amazing experience thank you

285
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,360
for the shirt i weren't probably got plenty of shouts for pod show and he'll have audio on

286
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:12,120
that in a couple days and he finished as i said 533 42 not as best time but he was played with

287
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,480
stomach cramps throughout the race still finished had a great time and he says i think my next podcast

288
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,200
will be pretty damn compelling because that's the one that'll be coming from uh the marathon

289
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,480
where he was actually doing the podcast wall running Steve runner dot com congratulations man i'm

290
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:34,520
i'm really blown away by uh by the whole concept and it was fun because i think i got five or six or

291
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:39,480
seven different emails and so it's actually sitting down just before i had dinner a pop the email

292
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,200
it was like oh i see Steve's uh you know got about an hour and a half less to go is it incredibly cool to

293
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:51,560
see hello come on in it's at here oh hello you're attention to a site called you shop you give

294
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:58,680
which is the letter u then shop then the letter u then give dot com now this site was set up to

295
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:06,120
let charities make some money from the affiliate links that different uh companies give and they've

296
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:13,160
gone out of business specially because some certain websites and quite famous ones that you can

297
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:18,360
work out have decided that they don't like the fact that people keep on going back to the new shop

298
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,040
you give to make to give the charities and money and it said they must prefer people go directly

299
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,760
to their site once they've gone to you shop you give once so you shop you give have had to go out

300
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:35,800
of business because the these particular companies have decided not to continue their affiliate links

301
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:41,320
anymore where if you shop you give which is a great shame that everyone involved and i'd just

302
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:45,480
like to bring this to your attention just to ask that similar type of thing just doesn't happen

303
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,520
with the put show charity affiliate links which you mentioned in the past thank you and thanks

304
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:57,240
for picking this up on the copy comments delicious feed bye okay sorry about the the audio levels

305
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:03,160
there i actually had to jack it up a bit so this is about the pod safe music network which is a part

306
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,080
of the unlabel and i've said that for the first year of sales leave it just goes to a period

307
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,560
so we can evaluate it but i'm pretty sure that this will be the status quo for the pod set music network

308
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:18,200
pod show is taking no none of the the money that is received for a sale there's a transaction fee

309
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:23,800
which is nine cents and that goes to a clicking by and then there'll be an affiliate fee so if

310
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:29,160
if you put a link on your show site or on your weblog wherever and someone purchases a track

311
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:34,200
through it and we're thinking of making that nice you know like 10% or maybe 15% and the choice

312
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,280
here is that you'll be able to donate that money to the artist so you take nothing isn't affiliate

313
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:43,560
or you can donate that money to a charity and i think the point of that comment was to say be

314
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,640
careful because sometimes when you use an affiliate link you can lose your affiliate status

315
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,680
because what these affiliate systems really want is for you to come to their site

316
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:59,000
and not just have one link that doughnates through them or something like that and i said don't

317
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,720
worry about it because we have direct contact with music cares which is for old beat up retired

318
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:12,600
musicians that's where musicians go when they're down and out i think Tony Bennett is the

319
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,400
chair of that so we'll make sure that that gets routed properly and if we have problems with

320
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,080
affiliate links which i don't think will actually be using i haven't heard from Chris Rockwell yet

321
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,400
with the dealers if we're going to go live with this simultaneously with podshow plus or if we're going

322
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:30,920
to do that with we're doing outside of of of the unleashed i'm not sure i have to get in touch

323
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,920
with the office to find out later on today by adding this is Dennis from the dedicated asked

324
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:39,080
hundred one uses for baby wipes checking in with an audio comment i'd send an audio comment

325
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:45,080
sometime back about using podcast is a form of community service by playing PSA's well a public

326
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:51,560
relations firm representing the centers for disease control contacted me asking for my help

327
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,560
getting the word out about their autism campaign kind of sounds like podcasting is being

328
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:00,200
recognized as legitimate outlet for delivering a message done it now i used to chase

329
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,240
organizations down that i wanted to support and asked for permission to play their PSA's

330
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:11,240
now they're coming to me a podcast or asking for help to get their message out how cool is that

331
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,640
anyway my latest show becomes a shameless plug i got to interview an expert in developmental

332
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:22,120
disabilities from the cdc and talk about their autism awareness campaign c april is autism awareness

333
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,920
month so i'm gonna have experts on my daddy cast all month to talk about it now i know that the

334
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:32,280
lascivious bitties are using their voices to raise awareness about MS and here's just one more

335
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,920
example of how podcasting can really help make a difference shameless plug again find my show at

336
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,080
101 uses for baby lives dot com iTunes and of course at the podcast music network megaplex

337
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:47,560
yeah the podcast music network megaplex yeah like it yeah you're right people are seeing it and the

338
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,880
minute the non-profits uh catch on this latch on to something you know what's happening because

339
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,040
those people know how to make money and not making it for themselves but they know how to raise money

340
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:00,760
and if they see an opportunity they jump on the bandwagon real quick so that's good for podcasting

341
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:06,280
and general appreciate the information tomorrow by the way i think we'll do a different type of source code

342
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,760
since the weather is so nice today i'm expecting it to be good tomorrow as well i won't

343
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:16,440
know until i read the matars and taffs later on tonight but but when i uh uh if if i'm in luck

344
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,320
then tomorrow morning early i'm gonna head off to uh the airport and gonna fly for an hour so

345
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:27,160
i'm gonna take Jason from the control tower along with me just to show me the area he's uh he's

346
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:31,320
about eight nine hundred hours on the single engine and he definitely knows the area and i was

347
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,560
thinking maybe you'd like to come along for the ride so i'll bring along the i River and the wireless

348
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:42,040
mic set and we'll uh we'll do some sound seeing from the sky over the affluent suburb of of

363
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:13,720
suggestions uh this was the the most interesting suggestion i heard of and a couple people seem to

364
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:20,600
agree that the Texas embassy rooms in Trafalgar Square would be the perfect place i'm like

365
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,640
we're coming to the UK to sit in the Texas bar i mean i you maybe you guys are trying to make us

366
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:31,960
feel at home or something like that but i do they have darts in the Texas embassy rooms anyway

367
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:37,080
i've left up the uh the venue to the pod pimp Aaron Aaron Brazil he's going to take care of that so

368
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:41,320
um sometime today i'm sure we'll have all that arranged and hope he'll set us up and i'll give you

369
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:46,520
the venue by tomorrow but definitely you know it'll be in London it'll be this coming Sunday the 23rd of April

370
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,240
and it will be at three p.m. it's just a couple hours just want to hang out you know we're not

371
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,960
going to do anything extravagant we just want to meet you guys and what i could see there was a wiki

372
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:02,440
set up somewhere that might have been a brick i think palpine field set that one up

373
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:08,360
it looks like 20 people have already said that they're coming so i'm expecting 30 and i think

374
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,880
are going to have a good time hi Adam it's uh Matt Moran here i just want to make some comments

375
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:20,360
on dsc 368 you were talking about bark is bank online banking i don't think you give them enough

376
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:26,040
credit really for the way they look after your money um i like the fact that when you send money to

377
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:31,080
another person online that it disappears for three days i've asked my bank where this money just

378
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,960
appears to but no one seems to know um i don't know who's making money out of all the interest but

379
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:41,400
it'd be good to find out some time anyway i just wanted to make a quick comment also about pod show

380
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:48,040
in the UK um the podcast and community in the UK is reasonably small um people are going to be

381
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:53,320
protective over the work they've created and also their position within that community which is why

382
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:58,200
them meet up in London is a good idea to actually sit down and talk about some of these ideas over

383
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,520
a pint anyway it'll be a good to meet up with the some of the other British podcasters and

384
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:10,920
yourself and some of the guys from pod show next Sunday so uh catch it in right now looking forward

385
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:17,800
to it i hope to see you there i don't know ma'am when i pay something through bark lays online um i

386
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,520
said you have a little checkbox it says remove from my account immediately uh yeah it's gone

387
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:28,120
immediately but usually the next business day it shows up as as transferred in paid so i've never had

388
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,360
anyone complain and no one said who haven't seen it for three days i have had that happen with

389
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:39,000
large amounts though much larger amounts uh in fact when we bought the uh we bought the the jag

390
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:45,640
had money transferred from the Netherlands it took over a week and it seems like the larger the amount

391
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,880
that's when you get someone's attention is all of the people start to wake up all of a sudden

392
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:55,080
when you transfer big amounts and and that does often get kind of oh you know just like lost in the

393
00:38:55,080 --> 00:39:03,960
shuffle yeah i'm feeling so bad oh yeah baby from the pod say music network it exposed you to
