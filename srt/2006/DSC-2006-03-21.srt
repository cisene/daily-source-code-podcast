1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta's here at Charley, 3-5-7.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm testing kids, Adam Curry.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
From the Curry condo in northern California, no sun but it is San Francisco.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Good morning everybody, it's Tuesday.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Get your country head on.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
No sign of weather, not a cloud in the sky.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Taking it easy, I was doing just fine.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
As God has my witness, I was mining my business.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
When she flew in the town, it's like a tropical breeze.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Face like an angel exes along as you please.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll never forget it.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I got all caught up in it.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
She was the object of my affection, then.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
When changed direction.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Lock down your shutters and your doors,

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but I'll love you for sure.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'll never see when she rains down on you.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You've been telling me you've been warned.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You don't know what you're meant for.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
She's a perfect star.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Once she comes, you'll never be the same.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So you better stay away from her again.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
She held like thunder when the sky opened up.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I started shaking when the lightning struck.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
My poor heart was breaking,

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
where every move she was making then she.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The ride over just as quick as she came.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
She probably don't even remember my name.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I wrote down the speechless trying to figure the pieces.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Just another seduction ever.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Path of destruction.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Lock down your shutters and your doors,

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
but I'll love you for sure.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll never see when she rains down on you.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You've been telling me you've been warned.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You don't know what you're meant for.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
She's a perfect star.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Once she comes, you'll never be the same.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So you better stay away from her again.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Once she comes, you'll never be the same.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So you better stay away from her again.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Once she comes, you'll never be the same.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So you better stay away from her again.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You'll never be the same, so you better stay away from Hurricane.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Life can't be scissors in your doors, but it'll hurt your motor stores.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Lord and mercy wins you race down on you.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You've been told you've been warned, you don't know what you're in for.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
She's a perfect storm, better stay inside, where it's safer than now.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Once you come, you'll never be the same, so you better stay away from Hurricane Jane.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Once you come, you'll never be the same, so you better stay away from Hurricane Jane.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Colin Ray, Hurricane Jane, kicking off this Tuesday's edition of the Charlie Good Morning,

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
everybody from San Francisco, California.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It is another one of those days.

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Overcast has been raining yesterday.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It was just horrible.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It rained.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It rained.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It rained.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's not supposed to do that in Northern California.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You know?

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah, tough getting out of bed this morning.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I got to tell you.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You just can't watch John Stewart with the Daily Show and get up at 6 a.m.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It just doesn't work that way.

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's too much.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Hey, some stuff to talk about today.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Actually, pretty light on the audio feedback and stuff like that,

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
but we're going to roll out a Trinity segment because it's about time for that.

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Congratulations to a serious satellite radio.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You may be listening to the show right now.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
A channel was a serious star as 102.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Over 4 million subscribers now.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Wow.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That one really fast.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It was 3 million.

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
They reached just before Christmas.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I think we're just before the New Year's and already now 1 million extra.

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So kicking some ass.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's very cool.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
More mainstream.

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Are you here that?

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I am the morning podcaster.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Kevin Flanagan sent an email and said,

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The Air America has moved their podcasts to a pay for fee service.

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I would pay, but think that for topical time sensitive material, the cost is too high.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's too bad.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You know, Air America was, I don't know if they were even official podcasts.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It was all over the map.

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I must have at least four or five different podcasts feeds that I'm subscribed to.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'll none of them work anymore.

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I think I've deleted three or four others.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But I think they have some major financial issues.

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Never really got Air America off the ground.

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So to speak.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And I really good day yesterday despite all the crappy weather.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Cali and Neil were up at the pod show HQ all day long.

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Cali, of course, are fearless leader from the geek intelligence agency.

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And, you know, it's funny because, you know, I have the new camera, the Sanio C5,

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
which I picked up at the Apple Store.

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yesterday was kind of my first day experimenting with it and learning how it worked.

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And it's limitations.

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
One thing I noticed right off the bat, which I kind of knew when I read the specs before I even bought it,

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
is that it doesn't have an external audio in.

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So you're kind of left to the device itself with it's built in stereo microphone.

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And because it's so small when you use the zoom or even when it's focusing,

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and it will invariably auto focus the minute you turn it on.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You can hear the motor worrying on the audio tracks.

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That kind of sucks.

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And of course, you have audio really is so important when it comes to video.

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And so I did this whole thing.

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I recorded different bits of clips and last night I came home,

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
dumped everything into what I used.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I used the eye movie.

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And I remember, man, it takes a lot of work to get video stuff going.

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's a lot of waiting around for stuff to import and stuff to render.

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And so I have, like, a four minute clip of a day in the life at Pod Show HQ,

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
which I don't know if I want to release it yet.

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I think I want to look at it again and go, because it's really,

122
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't know, I don't know if it'll be interesting.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It was interesting to me.

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't know if you guys would like it or not.

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Because of course, I'm not in it.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Most of it is other people.

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And the other people that I was seeing throughout the day.

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So it's a lot of Ron Bloom.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
There's other Pod Show folks in there.

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Of course, nice, significant pieces of Cali.

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And a baby.

132
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You know, it was a go figure.

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So I'm going to review it with a couple of people today.

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I see if they think it's worthy of putting it up there.

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I was just pretty interesting.

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Common I got from Michael Bauer, who was listening to,

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
see, DSC 340.

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll just read this for you.

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I thought it was interesting that you played the song about people talking loud

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
on their cell phones.

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Recently heard an interview on one of the MPR shows about this very subject.

142
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Turns out, the reason this happens is because cell phones,

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
unlike landline phones, do not play feedback to the user.

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The fact that you can't hear yourself makes you talk louder.

145
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And this, of course, sounds completely logical.

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And I do recall, I think the old analog cell phones actually did have that kind of loop

147
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
where you could hear a little bit in your ear.

148
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So the email goes on, you may think, like I did when first hearing this,

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
well, why not loop it back?

150
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah, that's exactly what I was saying.

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Well, apparently it's not that easy landline phones do this through the phone company.

152
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Your voice actually hits the phone company's exchange

153
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and it's bounce back as feedback since it's over copper wires.

154
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This happens really fast so the delay is very small.

155
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Cells transmit wirelessly to much slower rates.

156
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Of course, this would cause it delay.

157
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You probably noticed this when in a heated conversation,

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
we have heated conversations never.

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Anyway, the interview suggests that the problem will most likely be fixed by cell phone manufacturers.

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
They should place circuitry in the phones that repeat what the user says.

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
This causes the users to speak softly.

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's very interesting.

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I have no idea what, it's probably just laziness that they didn't do that

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
or probably a power issue as well because it all takes power to do that.

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But, gee, wouldn't it be nice if all cell phone conversations automatically just were dim down

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
30% or 40% wouldn't that be nice for the overall world volume population?

167
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I think that's a pretty good idea.

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It doesn't seem like a hard thing to do these days.

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Now, of course, with the battery life that they can get out of these miniature batteries.

170
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I thought just popped through my head, but she can't remember it's too early.

171
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Hi, I'm Mr. Bobeski here.

172
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I've just been thinking about your recent Charlie,

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
talk about your suspected power failure in your apartment in San Francisco.

174
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The reason I'm thinking about it is, I'm just sat here in total darkness

175
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
because we've just had a power failure here in Newbury, in Barsher, in England.

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's 9 o'clock on a Saturday night.

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Now, that's a really rare thing to happen.

178
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So, okay, big deal.

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Thing is, I've just been watching the War of the Worlds on DVD.

180
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Literally half an hour ago.

181
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And of course, that's all about power failures and lightning strikes and other things due to alien attack.

182
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What's made it even weirder, really surreal, is somebody's just had a firework party in the neighborhood.

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And there's all sorts of, you know, fireworks, bangers and explosions going on.

184
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So, I'm thinking it's just a local power failure, but it could be the start of something else.

185
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Getting nervous here.

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And we never heard from them again.

187
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yeah, it's, you know, it's really funky when that happens.

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You know, when the power goes out.

189
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And in the States, it gets a little bit more used to it.

190
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But in Europe, it never, and rarely ever happens.

191
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And for it to happen, I don't know how the UK is.

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We haven't had a power failure yet that I know, at least that one that wasn't, you know,

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,000
caused by excessive use of hair drying equipment and compressor limiter simultaneously.

194
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And maybe it does go out a lot more often in the UK than I know.

195
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Now, I'm telling you, I am so fuzzy today.

196
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
There's just, oh yeah, now I know.

197
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, I was going back to actually to the phone call comment.

198
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yesterday I actually had, not a heated discussion.

199
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, maybe it was a little an emotional discussion.

200
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I called Patricia from the office on IChat.

201
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I had my ear buds in and we love doing this.

202
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I've told you about this.

203
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
She gets on her end on the, on the IChat.

204
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And it's, it's really, it's a very, it's a very personal thing.

205
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You know, you can really communicate well.

206
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You can see nuances and we can smile at each other.

207
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And it really does feel quite natural, actually, at this point.

208
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
But there were some teenager stuff that was going on back at the cottage.

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And, and that's when it all breaks down, man.

210
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And you can't talk to a, you can't talk sense into a teenager through IChat.

211
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That just doesn't work.

212
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It doesn't work through phone calls.

213
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You really got to be there in the room.

214
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So I was feeling a little bit frustrated about not being home.

215
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And being able to help out with it.

216
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's not a big deal.

217
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But, you know, it's a teenager thing.

218
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You know, teenagers can get also and then get stupid.

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's talk to say, stupid stuff.

220
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh, well, what do we have left?

221
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Five days less than then I'll be back in the, in the arms of my girls.

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And then, of course, where was it like five days after I get home,

223
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
then we're off to, to Portugal for vacation.

224
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Did I tell you that?

225
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That we're going to Portugal.

226
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I think I did.

227
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The last rooms available in all of Europe, apparently.

228
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
This is the, the big Easter holiday.

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And all of the United Kingdom takes, well, not all.

230
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But it seems like everyone won the lottery.

231
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And it's all taken off this year's.

232
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Hey, what is this?

233
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Certainly, you remember this fine music.

234
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And you're welcome to sing along if you can.

235
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Okay.

236
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's a little bit on the soft side today, the Trinity theme song.

237
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Starting off with, oh, first of all, we have a slogan for the Trinity segment.

238
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
This comes from Sean Murphy.

239
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It should be green my machine.

240
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Actually, this is the big promotion that I've been thinking about.

241
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
We need more of those FAQs.

242
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If you're new to the daily source code.

243
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
This is a part of the week where we just talk about bio diesel and alternative fuels.

244
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And anything that has to do with changing the way we consume power or the types of power that we consume,

245
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
whether it be electricity or shoot, you know, stuff that you throw in in your tank.

246
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And we are working on a sponsor for this segment.

247
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So we can actually do some more with it.

248
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Now we're working on what I used to call the pimping of Trinity.

249
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Now, of course, I like this new slogan, the green my machine contest.

250
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Maybe something we could build out if we can get the sponsor interested enough.

251
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The first machine to be green will be Trinity.

252
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I want the servos in it to pop up and down.

253
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And of course, it's going to be a big, a big slogan on the side that I'll say.

254
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Save the world win valuable prizes.

255
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I think that pretty much says it all.

256
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's all we need to know about Trinity.

257
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't know.

258
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I don't know.

259
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I don't know.

260
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Hey, there Adam.

261
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
This is Matthew Ebel, skyping in from about the 76 miles above the surface of the earth

262
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
in my spaceship, the UTF revolution.

263
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And you thought you got high, huh?

264
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Alright, sorry about that.

265
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Hey, just wanted to let you know.

266
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The whole biodiesel thing didn't really work out for the starship here.

267
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It doesn't really go so well with my engines,

268
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
matter of fact, cost a lot of problems.

269
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And I'm actually just now in the engine room,

270
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
putting the final touches back on the engines,

271
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
reverting it to its original fuel source,

272
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
which, of course, is pulverized AOL CDs.

273
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You know, I'm still surprised that all you earthbound types

274
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
still haven't figured out the full potential of these pieces of shit.

275
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Wouldn't it be awesome if you could actually

276
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
use those AOL CDs to run your car on?

277
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Can you imagine how far many millions of miles we could drive

278
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
with all the excess CDs that are just out there?

279
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Anyway, I just wanted to let you know how happy I am

280
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
that the Podsafe music network has been selling some of my tracks for the last few days.

281
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Now, it's only been a few days.

282
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And a bunch of people have already rushed out to pick these tunes up.

283
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Alright, we'll be talking more about the Podsafe music network.

284
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
This is actually somewhat older comment I've been saving for Matthew Evel,

285
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
specifically for the Green-Mine Machine Trinity segment of the show.

286
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Moving on to Dan Kinsella.

287
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
This is surprising.

288
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And now that I think about it, I believe I saw a sign on the wall

289
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
at the biofueloasis the other day,

290
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
which related to this.

291
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Dan says, I'm a long time listener to the DSC as well as follower

292
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
of the biodiesel technology.

293
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I recently went looking to buy a new diesel car to try the technology out

294
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
and found out I couldn't buy one.

295
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
In New York, California, Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont,

296
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
it is not possible to buy a new diesel car due to emissions issues.

297
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And then this is all along article.

298
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And maybe someone can condense that down for everyone listening to the show

299
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
and explain exactly what the deal is.

300
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You can't buy new diesel cars.

301
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Is this a plot or what?

302
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You know, all of us, we all get turned on to biodiesel.

303
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And now you can't buy the cars.

304
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I gotta tell you, this sounds very suspicious to me.

305
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Hey Adam, Eric here from EricRites.com.

306
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Just wanted to drop you a little biodiesel info.

307
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
We're in the paper today that the governor of Indiana,

308
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Mitch Daniels, announced that the Lewis Triphus Corp,

309
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
will be building the world's largest biodiesel plant from Claypool,

310
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
just north of Fort William Indiana.

311
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Really close to me.

312
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Anyway, just wanted to drop you that note.

313
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's a $135 million project.

314
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
That's just awesome.

315
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And it will definitely be the world's largest biodiesel plant.

316
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
So I'll send you the link.

317
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And I'd just want to let you know.

318
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
We are definitely moving forward here in the heartland.

319
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Going free.

320
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'll make my daughter.

321
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What's she green to?

322
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
John Roberts e-mails that Oregon buses are running on biodiesel.

323
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
When he sent a link there.

324
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
No audio link unfortunately.

325
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Let's see.

326
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Luis Petuz checking in from Colombia.

327
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The government is very big on using compressed natural gas in cars.

328
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's at the same as LPG doesn't sound like liquid petroleum gas.

329
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
There's even a government bonus of 500,000 pesos.

330
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So that's about $223.

331
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
As you switch your car over gasoline prices are held here.

332
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So I took the plunge.

333
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I own a 1994 Nissan Pathfinder.

334
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And I had her converted to run on CNG and regular gasoline.

335
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Not only is she running cleaners since CNG is a cleaner fuel.

336
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But I'm spending more or less a third of the running costs as compared to gasoline.

337
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
CNG refueling stations in the northern part of the country are plentiful in the comm.

338
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And the conversion allows my car to run on conventional gasoline or compressed national gasoline.

339
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
No problems for running out of gas since CNG is mainly methane.

340
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I wonder how long until I can fart in my tank.

341
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Okay, Luis.

342
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Thank you.

343
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I really made my morning here.

344
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And then finally, DN Metzger.

345
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Hold on.

346
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Send me a link about a biodiesel here we go.

347
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Biodiesel rental cars coming to Los Angeles.

348
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
The bio beetle echo rental cars, which started out on the Hawaiian island of Maui three years ago,

349
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
opened for business near Los Angeles International Airport with four cars fueled by filtered vegetable oil.

350
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
How cool is that?

351
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
These are the things we need.

352
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And I think this is the, you know,

353
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
they have a whole bunch of really good car rental services in Los Angeles.

354
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I used to when they're a lot for MTV.

355
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I used to rent from the budget because they could, they would let you rent any car you could imagine.

356
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So if it was, you know, you wanted a Rolls, you could rent a Rolls.

357
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You wanted a Corvette, you could Corvette.

358
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You wanted a Mercedes S500.

359
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Anything you wanted to rent and they'd actually pick you up at the airport in the car that you wanted to rent.

360
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So these guys are once again on the tip and it was a great way because, you know,

361
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
you could kind of get a feel for the car that you might never buy or you might actually want to buy.

362
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But, you know, you want an extended road test.

363
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So that's a good way to get into it and see that there really is no difference running on, on, on biodiesel.

364
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Well, there is one big difference and that's, it just, it just smells so nice.

365
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
She could talk, you hear her fake.

366
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I don't forget being in her tank.

367
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
We're Trinity.

368
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Trinity.

369
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yeah.

370
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Do you want some tech news? It's different than the ordinary boring stuff.

371
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You found the bits of Silicon Hell podcast from deep in the heart of Texas.

372
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's Craig and his techno-possy.

373
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Your buddy in mind, dude Mac.

374
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Perfect.

375
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And Neil.

376
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
He's not too hungover.

377
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Wow.

378
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And whoever else shows up.

379
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Listen to this fine work of mortal achievement.

380
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Gonna bits of Silicon Hell.com.

381
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Or subscribe on iTunes.

382
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's at SiliconHell.com.

383
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yeah, was it?

384
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I found this, this great not actually didn't just find it.

385
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I went searching for this great screen saver for my Mac.

386
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I can't remember exactly how it came up with the idea.

387
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But I was, I was, yeah, it was a rummaging around on flicker.

388
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And it turns out, of course, if you go a little bit further than your own site on flicker,

389
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
then it is really a social network.

390
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And if you know the right tags to enter,

391
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
you can get all kinds of very interesting pictures.

392
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And I'm big on screen savers, not for saving my screen,

393
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
but for the information they provide.

394
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And if you have a Mac running OS,

395
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
you'll know that you can use an RSS feed.

396
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So I want it an aggregate RSS feed.

397
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So what I found is the screen saver called,

398
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
it's the 1,0001, 1001 screen saver from Mac OS X.

399
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And what you can do is you can set filters for,

400
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
for flicker tags.

401
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And basically, this thing will just sit there and pull in one flicker photo after

402
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
another base upon your, your filters.

403
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And it's really, really cool.

404
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I suggest you check it out.

405
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Hey Adam, feed up.

406
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Hey, satellite requirement.

407
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Eric Bergen's comments displayed some common misconceptions

408
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
about how the word compression can be applied to audio.

409
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah.

410
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
First, MP3 is a file size compression scheme,

411
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
not an audio compression scheme.

412
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It is designed to have the least possible effect on music files.

413
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Some compression schemes can be used to make a file smaller

414
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
and restore it to an exact copy of the original.

415
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
That kind of file compression, however,

416
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
doesn't make files much smaller at all.

417
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Scames like MP3 can make much smaller files.

418
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
But the price you pay is that when it is decoded,

419
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
some information is missing.

420
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Often you won't even notice that.

421
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
But of course, the smaller the file, the crappier the sound.

422
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But it is not the same as audio compression.

423
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
That's something completely different.

424
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Audio compression is used to raise the loudness of quiet sounds

425
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and lower the loudness of the loudest sounds,

426
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
making the difference between the loud and soft, less and less,

427
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
depending on how much compression is applied.

428
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It is achieved electronically and has nothing to do with MP3

429
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
or any other file compression scheme.

430
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
One thing I think he's right about, though,

431
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
is that the podsafe music network should try to establish

432
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
some minimum standards for file size compression schemes like MP3.

433
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Of course, this, even if followed, wouldn't guarantee sound quality.

434
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
A poor original recording will sound poor even if it's reproduced perfectly.

435
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I would like to recommend that submissions to the podsafe music network

436
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
be at a minimum 128 kilobytes per second

437
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
at a sampling rate of 44,100 Hertz.

438
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
If it's a stereo recording or 64 kilobytes per second,

439
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
at a sampling rate of 44,100 Hertz, if it is a monoral file.

440
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Both of those settings provide about an 11 to 1 savings in file size

441
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
while still sounding just about indistinguishable from the original

442
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
for most people's ears or most people's cares.

443
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Ideally, especially when it's intended to be used in a podcast,

444
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
which is going to add a second file size compression,

445
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:53,000
submitters should shoot 4192 kilobytes per second at 44,100 Hertz for stereo,

446
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
which is approximately a 7 to 1 reduction in file size.

447
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
When an MP3 is played back in a podcast,

448
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and that podcast then gets reencoded into an MP3,

449
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
that effectively doubles the amount of audio information that gets lost.

450
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It might even be more than that.

451
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
That can lead to audio that has a kind of a squishy, swirly sound,

452
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
which is not at all pleasant.

453
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Or correct.

454
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Uncle Jesse!

455
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Excuse me, I have to go close a window.

456
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Long way to go for a bit, Peter, but I appreciate it.

457
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Buy everyone on stereo, see tomorrow.

458
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I think, by the way, it's kilobytes and not kilobytes per second.

459
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
That's a common misconception, but it is very critical.

460
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It is a pretty short kilobytes.

461
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yeah, we'll be talking a little bit more about the pod save music network.

462
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Just a few more things I wanted to share with you today, because some good comments came in.

463
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:01,000
This next comment is actually a comment on everything's crackling and cropping out here.

464
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It's about the multi-tiered internet.

465
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Now, there's two real conversations that we're having about this.

466
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
One is about the so-called good male scam, which I'm just going to call a scam.

467
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:20,000
The other one is about, well, really stems from this interview on Heather Green's podcast

468
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:30,000
at Business Week, where the CEO of SBC, AT&T, was pretty emotional about saying that he was pissed off.

469
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
He really felt he was unparafraising now, but he was pissed off that Google is using their pipes to make all this money.

470
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
That's really what it came down to.

471
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Now, there are some very good points to be made about different types of traffic that run over the internet.

472
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And I had asked for experts to chime in.

473
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And here is one that, the first time it came in, it was, well, actually, you know what?

474
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I think he explains it in the beginning, listen in.

475
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Hello, Adam. This is Mark Milliman.

476
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I apologize for the poor quality of my last message to you.

477
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Hopefully, this will sound much better than getting the hang of cast blaster.

478
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Also, I'd like to give my appreciation to all of the podcasters out there, including yourself.

479
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I've really found what a challenging job it is to put out a high-quality podcast consistently day after day after day.

480
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I can't even get this little note out.

481
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm trying to understand how long it takes you guys to get these shows done that you will put out there for us.

482
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So, thanks again, and keep it up.

483
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
All right, so here comes his comment.

484
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
This is a good one, listen in.

485
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Hello, Adam.

486
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
lately there's been several misconceptions in the internet press, as well as two listeners of the Charlie,

487
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:56,000
including yourself concerning the R-Box desire to charge for prioritizing packets, the right over their backbone, and their access services.

488
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
This conception one is that they're doing it to reduce spam.

489
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
This is false.

490
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
That is a separate issue entirely.

491
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It should be addressed as a separate form.

492
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Okay, so we agree on that.

493
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
This has nothing to do with the good mail scam and with spam.

494
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:23,000
This is about the, I was almost a threat that AT&T SBC says, hey, we're going to start charging companies for pushing this data down the pipe.

495
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And it doesn't even, well, I don't know if they're talking about large data or not.

496
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Google doesn't seem like there's large amounts of data being requested on an individual basis.

497
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
On aggregate, of course, it is big.

498
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
So this is more about that particular statement.

499
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
This conception number two is that they're doing it to control the content that runs over their backbone.

500
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Before you, well, I'll listen what you say first.

501
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Probably false.

502
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And the reason I say probably is the fact that two executives from the two largest Starbucks in North America

503
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
make some very public statements concerning this exact issue.

504
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Truth be told, their true intent is to provide priority for packets that travel through their back bones and through their access.

505
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Okay, so let me just say one thing there.

506
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I don't believe that this is about controlling the content either.

507
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I believe it's just purely based on jealousy and the jealousy or envy may be a better word.

508
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And this is not new.

509
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
This is the same thing that happened with the cable networks.

510
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I remember, man, 10, 15 years ago, the cable networks.

511
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:38,000
These guys thought that they were NBC and then they started charging for access and creating their own special channels.

512
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Let's be honest, everything at the cable company does themselves when it comes to media and entertainment pretty much sucks.

513
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Because we call them trench diggers.

514
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
They dig trenches and pull cables and connect you up.

515
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
The DNA of these companies, any telco, is not media and entertainment.

516
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
So I think that they're just looking at their investment and saying, oh shit, man.

517
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
We spent a couple billion dollars.

518
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
The grant it wasn't their own money.

519
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
A couple billion dollars.

520
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And we're getting some pretty predictable returns on this stuff.

521
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And why everyone seems to be using it more and look at these Google fuckers.

522
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
There were $100 billion dollars.

523
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
See, they're a boxer in a unique position because they provide both the pipe and distribute content over it.

524
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,000
They know the providing the pipe is somewhat a commodity service and full of competition.

525
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And they also know the providing or distributing content is highly lucrative and very profitable.

526
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So they would like to also distribute the content exactly what I said.

527
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Now, because they have both the pipe and distribute the content, they can also control the complete user experience and provide a higher quality user experience.

528
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Then third party providers don't provide the pipe.

529
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:01,000
By the way, they have another advantage is they already have an existing billing relationship with the end user, which is not to be underestimated.

530
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:10,000
But they also know from past experiences when they give preference to their own content distribution.

531
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
They get hauled in front of Congress and for the FCC for being anti-competitive.

532
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Not just that, but their own content sucks ass.

533
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:31,000
They are creating the ability for third party service providers to pay for priority traffic to run over their internet pipes.

534
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Now, all packets are not created equal.

535
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And that's a good thing.

536
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Because streaming packets that for IPTV and VoIP are very time sensitive, whereas browsing the internet, doing internet searches, getting email, or even downloading the Charlie, is not time sensitive.

537
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Well, hold on a second.

538
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I mean, if you can't get the Charlie, you'd be Jones and Pretty Bad, my friend.

539
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It doesn't matter if your web search takes a half a second longer.

540
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,000
But it does matter if your VoIP call packets get three to half a second, because that will drop the call.

541
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:15,000
So, third party service providers can now pay a little bit extra to have this packets expressly routed through these backbones and internet access pipes.

542
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And for $5 a month extra, I'd gladly pay that to VoIP provider.

543
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
So, I can guarantee that I have fewer job calls, less echo, and higher quality conversation.

544
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Wouldn't you?

545
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Same thing with streaming video content.

546
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I'll tell you, make a lot of DRM issues go away if we could stream everything reliably.

547
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And throwing bandwidth at the problem is not an issue.

548
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
So, I hope that this lays some of the misconceptions concerning this issues.

549
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And we all welcome this with open arms.

550
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And also pay attention to safeguards that need to be in place to prevent them from abusing this, should they choose to in the future.

551
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Thanks a lot, Adam.

552
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Take care.

553
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Bye.

554
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
All right. Well, I really appreciate the feedback.

555
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And first of all, I obviously understand and agree that having some version of quality of service is very important when it comes to, you know, having connections that really are guaranteed to work.

556
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
So, voice over IP.

557
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Yeah, of course, I want my phone calls to be better. That makes a lot of sense.

558
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:25,000
You know what? And one explained in this manner, and you know, maybe you do want a really, really fat pipe for your, for your Xbox live experience.

559
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And that would really make it into an experience.

560
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I can kind of get into it, but I'm, you know, just the way it was communicated if anything.

561
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You know, the telcos need some PR help, man, because they get, they really rely on everyone up with this talk, you know, and it gets miscommunicated and then typical copy-paste culture format.

562
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You know, everyone starts just adding a little bit of, of nastiness on top as the message gets passed around before you know it.

563
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
We all hate the telcos.

564
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
But it is very interesting because, and I've had long conversations at the office about this.

565
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:14,000
People watch them harder than I am. Because, you know, it does put them in a very, very interesting, well, they already are in a very interesting spot in our food chain, you know, all of our content rolls through their pipes.

566
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:29,000
They do have the ability to, I mean, already, the big telcos are doing all kinds of stuff to traffic, and, you know, particularly when it gets down to the ISP level, if they happen to own the ISP, there's, you know, all kinds of restrictions and port blockage.

567
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And you name it, you know, and part of that is because it just got out of control.

568
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Man, we're seeing all kinds of denial of service attacks currently on several of our servers and, you know, what are you going to do?

569
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It's just an ongoing battle. It seems to be the cost of doing business. And if we could get some help on that, I wouldn't mind paying some extra.

570
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Oh, God. Oh, it's, I need some help. Somebody please. Oh, it's Angie.

571
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So I'm pretty excited to find that you guys are rolling the Podsafe Music Network into the podcast delivery network.

572
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
So we have one super site to go to and log in now.

573
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Let me just clarify a couple of things Angie's talking about here.

574
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Rolling in may not be the right word. It'll still be accessible as the music as the Podsafe Music Network.

575
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,000
But if you use the Pod Show podcast delivery network, the integration will become a lot easier. That's for sure.

576
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
That should make things a lot easier for us, shouldn't it?

577
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And of course, we'll have APIs for anyone to integrate that into anything they want to.

578
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
There's a couple of things that I'm hoping developers are working on for the full launch of the PMN.

579
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Namely, I would really love to see.

580
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Hey Chris Rockwell, you're listening to this is about you.

581
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
An album titled Field Added In and release date added in.

582
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I use this information when I'm announcing tracks and I would sure like to be able to stop Googling that and just have it automatically.

583
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And as an artist, I want people to know where they can buy the songs that they like.

584
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
They kind of need to know what CD it's on.

585
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Also, I'd love to be able to order the songs so we can put the newest at the top or the most popular at the top.

586
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:22,000
And I would love to have a longer description field for the artists because you can't say much in the teeny tiny box that's on there right now.

587
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And you wait until you see what we're going to trick this baby.

588
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
So we're going to trick it out so bad.

589
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's going to be all of those things you've been looking for.

590
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And you'll have to give us a couple of weeks to ramp up.

591
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:42,000
There's a lot of integration stuff merging of data bases and all kinds of technical things, but everything's up until now everything you said is on the list.

592
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Finally, as a band, I would feel a little bit more comfortable if we had the option of setting only like a 30 second clip from songs.

593
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm just a little nervous putting like every song from my two CDs up for the podcast.

594
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I know that the listeners have access to the full song through the PMN.

595
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And there's all that software out there that allows you to rip audio directly off of websites.

596
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So, Angie, Angie, you have little faith.

597
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Please.

598
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
This is where it breaks down for me.

599
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Look, this is an unlabel.

600
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Okay.

601
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,000
First of all, I don't think that you would even want to put all of your songs up on the PMN.

602
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
But not as, you know, for marketing purposes, perhaps.

603
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
But I think that there's a, you have to kind of figure out the ratio and what you do.

604
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,000
It's kind of, it's nothing out of the ordinary of what radio or MTV you're doing.

605
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You release a, what used to be called a single, which of course is not really released as a single anymore, but is released as a part of a CD or a part of an album.

606
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And that's really the promotional piece.

607
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And then, you know, we can buy love spirals on through CD, baby, I think.

608
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So it should be seen as a promotion if someone wants more than they can easily go buy the CD.

609
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Thirty-second clips just don't do it for me.

610
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It really doesn't.

611
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
That's, you know, that's the iTunes experience.

612
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And the only reason iTunes does it is for exactly the reason that you mention because they have DRM,

613
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
which means you can, you know, make copies of this, where you can make copies for yourself.

614
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I think five copies or five different machines is what it's limited to.

615
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But the reason I don't make full previews available, of course, is because it's very easy with software as you mentioned to go and rip it off.

616
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But here's what's happening.

617
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:43,000
This is not about a controlled area, you know, where people, there's so many different ways to rip off songs.

618
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
You could either, but this is a ton of ways to do it.

619
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It's really, really simple to steal stuff from Pods' music network or anywhere, really.

620
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And never pay for it.

621
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
But what we're seeing, and hopefully, I'll get an update today on our strong mail situation.

622
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
If the emails are working, I think they were testing, yes, they have to noon in the last night.

623
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:15,000
We're going to open up sales, so anyone can make as many tracks as they want available for purchase on the Pods' music network.

624
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
You'll see that this is an exercise in humanity, okay?

625
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:32,000
This is more about consumers for the first time proving that we're not thieves, okay?

626
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And Angie really has much as I love you.

627
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You know, you're already supposing that there are thieves out there in the audience.

628
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And guess what?

629
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:51,000
There are absolutely, but I truly believe, and we're already seeing in our Alpha Beta Zeta test of the couple songs that are for sale on PMN,

630
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,000
that people are very happy to go in and support the artists, because it's not really about buying it.

631
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
It's a shit about 99 cents, and that's not the big deal, the big deal is about supporting the artist.

632
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And I think that that's really what, it's the same thing with software.

633
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,000
You know, there's no difference in my mind between a zip file or an EXE file or an MP3 file,

634
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
except in the runtime and how it's used, the actual data.

635
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And you've got to put stuff out there, that's the only way it works, it really is.

636
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So while I understand that you're nervous about it, let's give it a try.

637
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Okay, don't put all your tracks up, but make your tracks available for purchase, as soon as we go live with that stuff.

638
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And I'll ping you to make sure that you know and get you any help, which I don't think can need because all it is is just checking a box.

639
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
It's 30 second clip, no harm, no foul.

640
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Anyways, looking forward to seeing the full lunch, you know, I'm gonna be right there.

641
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Checking out tracks for, hey, here comes a promo, chillcast.podshow.com and to be signing out.

642
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Oh, the toss at tones of Angie B.

643
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Hey, I'm Russell from Darkman's podcast here again.

644
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Just a quick one this time, just let you know that I'm a papers head five of Darkman's and I've just got my first response from a PMN artist that I've been playing.

645
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
But gone from the problem, didn't know you in birds.

646
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
There's replied saying thanks for playing and sent me a ID for my shower along with it.

647
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:31,000
So I just thought that was great from him and I hope that the other PMN artists are as equally good at acknowledging when podcasts are playing their music because I think I think podcasts will appreciate the feedback.

648
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I know I certainly do.

649
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Yeah, that's all catching next time.

650
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
That's really how the whole unlabel thing comes together.

651
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Again, it's an experiment in humanity and you know, I got to say that there's probably not a song that I've played on the source code that I don't get a personal email from the artist from the band thanking me for playing it.

652
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And I always reply kind of in the same manner.

653
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
It's like, you know, just keep on bringing the cool tunes.

654
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
That's all I want. That's all that it's about.

655
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And this is how we promote podcasting.

656
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
This is how we promote independent music by working together.

657
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And it's the podcasts, it's the artists, and it's the listeners.

658
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And you know what? It's freaking working.

659
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
So my video, which I may release today, was cut to this track.

660
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Listen to the words. I think you'll understand.

661
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Everything I need.

662
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Better than the old dead frequency from underground.

663
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Who've done the sound?

664
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Come set the fire, burn the old dial.

665
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Time is now.

666
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
You are never alone.

667
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
All I know is a drum.

668
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Can't stand the thought of all the same.

669
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
And you are wasted.

670
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You've been brought to the bone.

671
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It's like, when you call you into show.

672
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And you're in the same.

673
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
The same, it's like you're wasted.

674
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
And you're not able to take it over.

675
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
You can't find people taking it over.

676
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And you're not even taking it over.

677
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And you're not able to take it over.

678
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:38,000
We're in control, everywhere you go

679
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Once we start to flow, you're in the know

680
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Let the police see each other, it's not the lead

681
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Suck away the green, break out the beach

682
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
The parade for free, kill the radio crew

683
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
You are never known, all I know

684
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
But the crown can't stand a daughter

685
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
For the tag that you have wasted

686
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
You've been brought to the moon

687
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Save me all you've been shown

688
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
You've been the fucking tag

689
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Time that you have wasted

690
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I keep on taking a lie

691
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I keep on taking a lie

692
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
The invasion is coming closer

693
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I keep on taking a lie

694
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I keep on taking a lie

695
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I keep on taking a lie

696
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
The invasion is coming closer

697
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
But the invasion is coming closer

698
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I keep on taking a lie

699
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I keep on taking a lie

700
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I keep on taking a lie

701
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I keep on taking a lie

702
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I keep on taking a lie

703
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

704
00:44:44,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

705
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:44,000
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

706
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
monk, as I said from the Podsate Music Network.

707
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Just one last thing before I go, I posted something

708
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
at the end of the day yesterday, San Francisco time about

709
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
creative comments and about a comment I had made earlier.

710
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And let me just elaborate on that a little bit because I found

711
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
time and time again that writing just doesn't work for me.

712
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Whatever I write, I'm just a bad writer.

713
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
It usually gets misconstrued to the words,

714
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
good, and overanalyze, and picked apart, and then before you

715
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
confusion, which is really why I like audio so much more as my medium.

716
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
And let me just give you the genesis of a real quick.

717
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
As the lawsuit against the Gossip Mag started to heat up,

718
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
and we're getting closer to the date,

719
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
actually even before I filed the lawsuit,

720
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I'd reached out to creative comments to Lawrence Lessick

721
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
personally, actually that came through,

722
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
it actually the introduction or the raising of the issue

723
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
was done by a student of his.

724
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
That's how it all came together.

725
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Now just to make a very long story short,

726
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I felt that there wasn't a lot of help that creative comments

727
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
had to offer for me.

728
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Although I think I misappropriate or misrepresented that

729
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
the absolutely did certainly Lawrence Lessick said,

730
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
hey, let me know if there's anything I can do.

731
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
So there really wasn't anything that can be done.

732
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I just wanted some open communication.

733
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And I didn't really need creative comments help,

734
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
so I don't need any financial help for bringing the lawsuit.

735
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
But just kind of got me at an emotional level.

736
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
You have to understand that in the Netherlands,

737
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
whenever I do anything,

738
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I'm always ridiculed for it.

739
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
And there may be reasons for that, too.

740
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,000
But the press was extremely mean and hateful

741
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
about this, of course, I was suing the press.

742
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So what does the press do?

743
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
They jump all over someone when they want to make waves.

744
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And there is a Dutch chapter of Creative Commons.

745
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
As I now know, it's volunteers and it's maybe a little less organized

746
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
than I thought it was.

747
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
And I didn't hear a peep from them.

748
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Not a word, not a single hay.

749
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
There's something important coming up,

750
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
nothing on their weblog, nothing in the press.

751
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
And then after the lawsuit, I hadn't still had not,

752
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I actually sent a professor, a link and said,

753
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
hey, I posted, here's the judgment.

754
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Here's what's going on.

755
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
And he said, okay, I'll take a look at it.

756
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Didn't hear back from him.

757
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And so the next message I saw was this press release,

758
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
including the director or manager,

759
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
whatever of the Dutch chapter of Creative Commons,

760
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
saying, well, isn't this great?

761
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
You know, it was a fantastic for Creative Commons.

762
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
And this is all good news.

763
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And Yipity, hey, and I'm like, you want a fucker.

764
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
You know, where was the backup?

765
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
And it felt so typical.

766
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
It actually felt very typically Dutch to me.

767
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Because this is almost cultural.

768
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
It's like, oh, I'm not going to say anything.

769
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
But oh, you know, the war is over.

770
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
We're all going to jump out and rejoice.

771
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
And so it just piss me off.

772
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And I wrote a piece on my weblog,

773
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
which kind of mischaracterized the relationships.

774
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
So it had some email back and forth with Lawrence.

775
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
It's funny.

776
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
We had more email about that than about the whole case itself.

777
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And I just called it out and said, look, my bad.

778
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I was emotional.

779
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
But, you know, what do you guys do?

780
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
What does the whole point of Creative Commons?

781
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
You know, where was the voice behind me?

782
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I just didn't feel like I got any backup.

783
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,000
And so, you know, everyone kind of copped to all the mistakes they had made.

784
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
And really, we said, hey, this is a learning experience.

785
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
And let's figure out how we can make it easier for the next time.

786
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Something like this comes along for someone else.

787
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And so I just want to read this email that Lawrence sent to me.

788
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Although it's belated, unfortunately framed.

789
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Thank you for doing what you did.

790
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
There are very few who do things that really benefit the public far more than they could ever benefit from themselves.

791
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
That's what you do here.

792
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I can express adequately how happy I was when I saw you were going to do what you did.

793
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I was extremely eager to help as I had long hoped we might be able to conspire more closely.

794
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
And earlier efforts to reach out hadn't seemed to connect.

795
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Wow, man.

796
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
That's, I don't know what that is.

797
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I don't, not quite sure what he means.

798
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,000
But email in general is just a shitty way to connect when it comes to stuff like the hate email.

799
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Anyway, Lawrence goes on, I read perhaps incorrectly a desire to keep distance and control in this case.

800
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
So I didn't push it.

801
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:23,000
See, that's where that's where weblogged postings and stuff just doesn't connect.

802
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I didn't want to keep any distance or control.

803
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I just wanted some backing and some voices out there that could help me out because there were very few voices pushing for me.

804
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:40,000
So that was just a total human error miscommunication on both sides, obviously.

805
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Lawrence says I'm just happy it ended in a way that made principle clear.

806
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Right on, your story makes me think we should raise a defense fund that we keep set aside for people in your circumstance.

807
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Legal rules limit what we can do in that regard, surprise surprise.

808
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,000
But it might make sense for both the movement and individuals to create a common defense fund.

809
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
If you'd be up for suggesting it, I'd be happy to take the idea.

810
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Yeah, I think it's a good idea.

811
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:12,000
But maybe it should be not in a monetary form, but it should be in a form of assistance.

812
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:19,000
So I could contribute, if I were a lawyer, I could contribute some hours, which, of course, is directly relatable to money.

813
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
But, you know, some lawyers actually have a quota of pro bono work.

814
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
They want to fill up that could be one way.

815
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I'd be very happy to testify or do anything that I could do.

816
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I'd contribute my time that way.

817
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And really I think what we need is kind of like an FAQ of exactly what an organization like Creative Commons can do.

818
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And again, I wasn't looking for financial help and it still seems like perhaps Larry thought that's what I was talking about.

819
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:50,000
But I was really just talking about some backing, you know, just some more voices out there in the blogger sphere,

820
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
while I was attacking the problem and not only after the fact.

821
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,000
So I think in general, this whole situation has been really, really good.

822
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Good for Creative Commons, good for the intellectual property rights of individual creative people who are using the internet

823
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
as their distribution, medium and vehicle.

824
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:15,000
But it's also been good as we learn more about how we should be working together and what Creative Commons does

825
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:23,000
and how it can be utilized to strengthen our position in the Creative landscape even more.

826
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:29,000
So I'm really happy we worked all of that out and, you know, it's just just so ironic.

827
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Web logs and everything sometimes make it much, much more complicated.

828
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Alright everybody, that's it for today's show.

829
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I'll be back tomorrow.

830
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
We'll be over the hump and I'll be, I'll go to bed even earlier.

831
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
So I'll be even more coherent.

832
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Another pod show pod guest.

833
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Stick it in your ear.

834
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Get this pod guest and we're great ones like it.

835
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,000
On the high performance pod cast of Libri Network from Podjo and line white networks.

836
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I love it.
