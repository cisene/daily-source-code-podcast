1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
For the first time ever, the Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. in one action-packed DVD collection,

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,000
own all 27 episodes, the cult hit, including all new interviews with Carlton Koo.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,560
First thing that Brisco did that impressed us was, we're not only to come in and really read the dialogue well as an actor,

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,720
but he also did a standing flip in our office.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,640
You flipped too for Brisco County!

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,360
If you like the kind of TV you can't get on TV, get your copy of the Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,360
Available now on DVD.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,360
Pop on Microsoft, I'm burn for Marshall, 4-6-9 or...

9
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,360
Daily source code, 4-6-9.

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,360
I mean the DLC, 4-6-9.

11
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:36,360
The worst time at this, every time on the high, I'm head to where you're place.

12
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,360
The world that goes through the base is running through my mind.

13
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,360
I think of the day I leave all of the time.

14
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,360
This solution's up for myself, all running through my head.

15
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,360
You know where to go, but back from here, you know where to go, the way you take.

16
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,360
I can be now accountable for things of on your rise.

17
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,360
I can expect to win with you, and you want things to last.

18
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:19,360
Yeah, I know, it's more safe.

19
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,360
You will be the best one I've ever been.

20
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,360
Right, they say...

21
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,360
I tell I fight in action.

22
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:46,360
The fight inside my head, I'm twisted with no respect for future wishes.

23
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,360
The days go by up, come too fast.

24
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,360
You're a part of my future, like you're far from my path.

25
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,360
If you don't lose time, I'll bet they won't be alright.

26
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,360
It's a blessing count, and I've gone for the night.

27
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:15,360
This solution's up for myself, all running through my head.

28
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,360
You know where to go, but back from here, you know where to go, the way you take.

29
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,360
I can be now accountable for things of on your rise.

30
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,360
I can expect to win with you, and you want things to last.

31
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:38,360
Yeah, I know, it's more safe.

32
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:45,360
You will be the best one I've ever been.

33
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Right, they say...

34
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,360
I tell I fight in action.

35
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:08,360
You know where to go, but back from here, you know where to go, the way you take.

36
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,360
You know where to go, the way you take.

37
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,360
You know where to go, the way you take.

38
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,360
You know where to go, the way you take.

39
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,360
You know where to go, the way you take.

40
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,360
I tell I fight in action.

41
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,360
It's a blessing count, and I've gone for the night.

42
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:44,360
You know where to go, the way you take.

43
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Yeah, I know, it's more safe.

44
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,360
You will be the best one I've been.

45
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Right, they say...

46
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,360
I tell I fight in action.

47
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:20,360
I tell I fight in action.

48
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Step behind.

49
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,360
Back in action from the pods, safe music network.

50
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Why that song, you're asking, well, I'm in an emo mood, my friends.

51
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,360
Yes, an emo mood indeed.

52
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,360
We were so happy.

53
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:43,360
You know, the house that we finally agreed to sail on the curry colosseum, got a phone call yesterday.

54
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
You're not going to believe this.

55
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,360
It's like, what kind of luck are we having with this lately?

56
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,360
There's a covenant on the house.

57
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,360
The house was built in 1976.

58
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,360
This covenant dates back to then, so that's 30 years.

59
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:13,360
A covenant that says that the garage, as you and I would say, may not be converted for use for anything other than a garage.

60
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,360
This unfortunately was exactly where we planned to have the new kitchen.

61
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Since the existing kitchen was going to become my office and studio, it actually has a built-in studio compartment.

62
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,360
You know, soundproof and everything.

63
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,360
Of course, the door opens so we can still hear the trash collectors.

64
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:38,360
But now it's gotten all complicated and we have to go to the council and figure out what this covenant can be removed.

65
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,360
What was the intent of the covenant?

66
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,360
It's really, really, it's all this appointing.

67
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
So now we have to do two things.

68
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,360
Go through that process and also try to reconfigure the work that we wanted to have done to see if we can still fit in.

69
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,360
I am that may require planning permission.

70
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,360
You see why I'm emo.

71
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
You see?

72
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
Maybe this will cheer me up.

73
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,360
Hi Adam and Patricia.

74
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,360
This is Ali from Swingercast.

75
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,360
Oh, man, she's not here.

76
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
But it's okay.

77
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
I'll pass the message.

78
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,360
I mean, pass your message.

79
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,360
I've been thinking, you know, 69 has always been my favorite number, but 469.

80
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Hmm, that's even better.

81
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,360
That's my new favorite number.

82
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,360
That's a hot combo.

83
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,360
469.

84
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,360
John tells me you like to have people send you naked pictures.

85
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,360
Check your mailbox.

86
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,360
Folder or scruncher?

87
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
I guess I'm by.

88
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
I do them both.

89
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
I fold and scrunch.

90
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
How about that?

91
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,360
Delta Sierra Charlie number 469.

92
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
All right.

93
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
Feel much better now.

94
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Everybody.

95
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,360
It's episode 469 coming to you from Curry Cottage in the affluent suburb of Surrey known as Gilford.

96
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,360
The pod show SF crew coming in over the next two days.

97
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
So it's going to be real busy.

98
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,360
Should be able to squeak out a Friday Charlie for you.

99
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
Although I'll have to do it from the hotel room.

100
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360
I think I'm going to stay Thursday night.

101
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,360
London in order to get a fresh start Friday.

102
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Because we have the digital musical words coming up on Tuesday.

103
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,360
It's just busy and busy back in San Francisco as well as we have yet another fantastic podcast

104
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,360
Joining our pod show lineup.

105
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
Adam, this is Chris Christensen.

106
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,360
I thought I'd give your listeners a little taste.

107
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,360
With the amateur traveler podcast, it's like sometimes it goes to exotic locations.

108
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,360
If you're not sure you've seen Star Wars on that's land and they don't ever bar.

109
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,360
It was exactly like that.

110
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,360
Where we hear wonderful things.

111
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,360
Sometimes we inform.

112
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,360
There's a smaller museum up a little way.

113
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
It's not a bad walk.

114
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,360
Called Lorojiri.

115
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Or just a muse.

116
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,360
The monastery of the royal bath with the nuns.

117
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
Adam.

118
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,360
Of course.

119
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
I did it.

120
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,360
And sometimes both.

121
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,360
And in my plate there was kind of this gloppy looking thing with a little bit of meat.

122
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Turns out I got the penis and test.

123
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
Oh, the amateur traveler podcast.

124
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Amateurtraveler.com.

125
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
All right.

126
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Congratulations.

127
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
Welcome to the family.

128
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,360
I've been listening to the amateur traveler podcast for a while.

129
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
I like it.

130
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,360
I love all kinds of travel podcasts, especially if they include kind of like the sound

131
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,360
seeing sound, seeing tours.

132
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,360
Where you're actually on location talking to people.

133
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
I love stuff about different food.

134
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
Not too sure about the testicle.

135
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
I think's really catchy.

136
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,360
It's the one that everyone rebelled against.

137
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,360
And then Jeff Smith Smith even sent in a new one and a new voice mail comment line number

138
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Jingle.

139
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,360
But this one is catchy, man.

140
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,360
You can just remember it as I plus one.

141
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,360
6256357.

142
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,360
And for the UK plus four four two zero seven six eight one three seven five three.

143
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,360
Mess just coming in from around the globe.

144
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
Hey, Adam.

145
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
My name is Christopher.

146
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,360
I'm a podcast from Germany.

147
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,360
I've said this before.

148
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,360
There's something about German speaking English that I love.

149
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
It's just I can listen to it all day long.

150
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,360
There's not enough German podcasters doing English podcast.

151
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,360
Please do more of that because I can listen to it all day long.

152
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,360
Okay, continue.

153
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,360
I got a solution for the problems with the PMN and the Blossom Germany.

154
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,360
I found an article at Heizet.de where you can read in that the

155
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,360
Gemma and Germany got a partnership with the American Associations.

156
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,360
I think they are called Ask Open PMI.

157
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,360
So what it basically means is that the Gemma can only provide the rights.

158
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,360
They got from the Ask Open PMI and Ask Open PMI.

159
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,360
Don't have the rights for the songs on the potsafe music network.

160
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,360
What it means is that we in Germany are allowed to play all the songs from the potsafe music network.

161
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,360
But that wasn't the only reason for sending this audio comment.

162
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,360
I don't know if your logic holds water there.

163
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Be it.

164
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
I don't know.

165
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,360
You know what?

166
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,360
It's hard.

167
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,360
I don't want the show to turn into like a legal show.

168
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,360
The daily legal stores code.

169
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,360
I just.

170
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,360
You know, I got nothing against lawyers personally, but just a whole process.

171
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,360
You know, now I'm going to have to go through all this legal crap with it.

172
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
Forget about it.

173
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,360
What's the other reason you call my friend?

174
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,360
I also want to ask you if there would be maybe a German Potion network.

175
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,360
My podcast is on the American Potion network, but a German Potion network

176
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,360
maybe would be better for us in Germany than putting our stuff on the American one.

177
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,360
So my podcast is now on dailypot.potion.com.

178
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Check it out.

179
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Thanks, Adam.

180
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
I'm a folder.

181
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Ah, yeah.

182
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
I want to choose who's got.

183
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
Yeah.

184
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,360
Well, I wouldn't mind doing a country for a specific version of Potion.

185
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
That would be cool.

186
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,360
But, you know, we have to find some partners as what we did here in the UK.

187
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,360
And I'm just, you know, we don't have anyone in Germany right now.

188
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,360
But we could put together some kind of something cool.

189
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
Well, it would be feasible.

190
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
It cost a lot of money.

191
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,360
You know, it just doesn't mean these things happen.

192
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
It really does.

193
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,360
BTpodshow.com is coming along quite nicely.

194
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,360
I've seen on the internal network and cost us some amazing content that's being sent in.

195
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
Hi there, Adam.

196
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
It's Mike Cooper here.

197
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,360
He's calling regarding some charity events coming up.

198
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
I thought you'd be interested in.

199
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,360
And this I'm Mike Reciple C has actually access for free screenings of the devil

200
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,360
where's Prada, the film starring Merrill Streep, and half the way.

201
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,360
And your listeners have got the chance to see it before it goes on general release.

202
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,360
It's all part of raising money for breakthrough breast cancer.

203
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,360
There'll be volunteers on the evening collecting money.

204
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,360
And so hopefully listeners can go along and participate in this.

205
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,360
The screenings are completely free.

206
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:01,360
We're taking place across the UK in Gateshead, Edinburgh, Manchester, Belfast and Bristol.

207
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,360
And if anyone's interested, they can go along to the website to register for tickets.

208
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,360
The address is www.nessan.co.uk.

209
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,360
And just click the devil words prior to link.

210
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,360
Thanks a lot.

211
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,360
Bye bye.

212
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,360
Was that a commercial?

213
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
Was that a commercial for Nissan?

214
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,360
What the hell was that?

215
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,360
Let me just check the sound for a second.

216
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Let me see what that...

217
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,360
I thought he said Nissan.co.uk.

218
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
What are they doing?

219
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
How are they sponsoring this?

220
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
Hold on a second.

221
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,360
Nissan.co.

222
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Not getting paid for this one by the way.

223
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,360
But it sounds like a pretty cool, pretty cool deal for each hit.

224
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
Hmm.

225
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
Maybe I misunderstood it.

226
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
It's server not found.

227
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,360
How was that?

228
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,360
Nissan.co.uk.

229
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
Didn't he?

230
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
Hold on a second.

231
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,360
I'll rewind it.

232
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,360
Nissan.co.uk.

233
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,360
Sounds like it is www.nessan.co.

234
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
You can.

235
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,360
You can.

236
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
And just click the devil words prior to link.

237
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,360
Thanks a lot.

238
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
Bye bye.

239
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,360
Maybe after www, which is very old fashioned.

240
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
Oh, shit.

241
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
It's working.

242
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Nissan.

243
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
Get your shit together guys.

244
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Nissan.co.uk should work as well.

245
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Okay.

246
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,360
The devil words prior to where is it?

247
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
I don't see that.

248
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,360
Hmm.

249
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,360
Services, vehicles, inside Nissan.

250
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,360
Special offers.

251
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
Maybe it's under special offers.

252
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,360
I don't know.

253
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,360
Surfing.

254
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
So you don't have to.

255
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Not mind.

256
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
I'll check it later.

257
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,360
If I find the actual link to what he's talking about.

258
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
Of course, I'll put that into the show notes.

259
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
A daily source code.com.

260
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
Anyway, good deal.

261
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Nissan's doing that.

262
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
I gave it his Nissan if they're doing it for.

263
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,360
For breast cancer.

264
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,360
And you can get a free screening out of it.

265
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,360
And actually as a movie, I do want to see.

266
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,360
I'd love to take Patricia, but it didn't sound like they were doing anything in London.

267
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,360
Mr. Curry.

268
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,360
I was out taking my dog for a walk today.

269
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,360
And I realized there's a particular area that we walk through.

270
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,360
That is very affluent.

271
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,360
There is generally three or four cars on the.

272
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,360
Big driveways.

273
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360
And these are, you know, not, not the cheap cars.

274
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,360
These are big expensive cars.

275
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
Several of these houses.

276
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,360
If you look at them from the Google Earth, you'll see.

277
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,360
Swimming pools in the back garden.

278
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,360
I don't think any one of them that's got a helipad.

279
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,360
But I wouldn't be surprised if they had.

280
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,360
And then I realized that that's where name of this lane.

281
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Explains it all, really.

282
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,360
It's called Folders Lane.

283
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,360
Exactly.

284
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,360
I thank you so much for taking a picture of it.

285
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,360
I put it in as the album march for today's show.

286
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,360
If you're listening to this on, uh,

287
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,360
we know's media player or real player or, um,

288
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,360
or even quick time and an iPod or, uh,

289
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
the pod show player you'll see.

290
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Folders Lane.

291
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,360
Yes.

292
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
Uh-huh.

293
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,360
An affluent suburb indeed.

294
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,360
Are you tired of trying to go through the 30 plus songs that they are

295
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,360
to upload to the five safe music network?

296
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,360
Do you want to know when your favorite artists are both in the track?

297
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,360
Let me do the work for you.

298
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
You need today.

299
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,360
Only plays the newest pod safe music from the pod safe music network.

300
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,360
This six-minute podcast will play one song from the pod safe music network

301
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,360
most weekdays.

302
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,360
Come check us out today at newmusic today.net

303
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,360
or newmusic today.possil.com.

304
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,360
I'll take that.

305
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
I'll take that.

306
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
I'll take that.

307
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
I got the show.

308
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,360
I got it.

309
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
I thought that was good.

310
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Yeah.

311
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
I love getting the new music.

312
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
So if you're going to put one together every single day now,

313
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
make sure that you don't just put the music out there.

314
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
But you actually make a show because you can't just redistribute it.

315
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
But I know what you're doing.

316
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
So that's cool man.

317
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
Very good idea.

318
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,360
I wouldn't mind if you played a couple more.

319
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,360
Give me.

320
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,360
It seems like every day there's between.

321
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,360
I think on average it must be about 20 new tracks that are uploaded to the pod safe music.

322
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,360
Now we're going to play another one at the end of the show, obviously.

323
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,360
And I have, uh, yes.

324
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,360
The official musicologist slash ambulance,

325
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,360
Chaser of the Charlie Jersey Todd will be coming up in just moments to weigh in

326
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,360
about the Apple trying to trademark podcast controversy.

327
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,360
But first, information about urine.

328
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,360
Hey, this is Bubba at the, uh,

329
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,360
a lot of punk podcast at a lot of punk.

330
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,360
Uh, podshow.com.

331
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,360
Listen, the reason you're pissed now is because the spirit has a,

332
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,360
in time in it called, uh,

333
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,360
lots of silver based things on called Mark Captain.

334
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,360
And if you have a special jean in your body that breaks it down even further,

335
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,360
makes it smell like, uh, I don't know, like, scump this.

336
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,360
That says because you've got that jean.

337
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,360
Hey, onions, garlics.

338
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,360
Uh, I didn't say it smell like scump this.

339
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,360
Scunks aren't very nice smelling.

340
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,360
Uh, I can't, I told you I was on the border where they're like this.

341
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
Oh, no, but I don't think it's scump this.

342
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
All those, they'll do the same thing.

343
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,360
Uh, plus hey, the service has got lots of fiber,

344
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,360
vitamins, good stuff like that.

345
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,360
One of them telling you one thing that's kind of disappointed about with the

346
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,360
digital music awards.

347
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,360
Go hold on a second. Okay.

348
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,360
So that's kind of solved.

349
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,360
I guess it's a jean.

350
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,360
That's very interesting.

351
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
A jean.

352
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
So it's the sulfur.

353
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
I did read this.

354
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
A lot of people sent me information about it.

355
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,360
And not everybody has this smell.

356
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,360
And I'm wondering, of course, you know how my mind works.

357
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,360
I'm immediately wondering.

358
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,360
Is there a correlation, perhaps,

359
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,360
between this jean that makes your urine smell like scunk piss.

360
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,360
And scrunchers or folders.

361
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
Or not at all.

362
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,360
And I appreciate you playing country music on the show.

363
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,360
There aren't so wild.

364
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
Listen, you want some good work in the country.

365
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,360
Come do at wallpongs. podshow.com.

366
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,360
Any time, listen.

367
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,360
And above us, thanks for the show.

368
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
I'm older.

369
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
No, I'm above, but thank you, man.

370
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
Yeah.

371
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
Um, that's interesting.

372
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,360
You say that about the digital musical awards.

373
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,360
I, um, it's an English award as far as I know.

374
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,360
It's, or it's very, uh, Anglo-centric.

375
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,360
And it's sponsored by British telecom.

376
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
And you know what?

377
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
Country music.

378
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,360
It just does not go over very well in the UK.

379
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
Hey, Adam.

380
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,360
This is Murphy from Murphy's Salute podcast.

381
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
Home of the Blues.

382
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,360
Um, I'm calling about the comment you just made on, uh,

383
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,360
the SC468 about, um,

384
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,360
what I call a Sparigus P.

385
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,360
It's an enzymatic, as I understand it.

386
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,360
It's an enzymatic reaction of the body that, uh,

387
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,360
only 15% of the population have.

388
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,360
They don't know exactly what causes it,

389
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,360
except it's an enzymatic reaction.

390
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,360
And, uh, that's it.

391
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,360
I, uh, you imagine you'll probably hear from some doctors,

392
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,360
but that's the simplest explanation that I know.

393
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,360
Yeah.

394
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,360
Take care.

395
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,360
Love the show.

396
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,360
Um, former smudger.

397
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Oh, very good.

398
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
A convert.

399
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
Fantastic.

400
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,360
Welcome to the club.

401
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,360
Yeah.

402
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,360
It's weird.

403
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,360
I didn't know that it was only 15% of the people.

404
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,360
And, uh, and now that I think back it, you know,

405
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,360
that it could very well be possible.

406
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
But it's something genetic.

407
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
So that's interesting.

408
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,360
Uh, again, uh, I post to you the test.

409
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,360
Is this something that might even fit into our scrunchers and folders?

410
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,360
Okay.

411
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,360
The iPod podcast trademarking debate.

412
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,360
Yesterday I weighed in, gave you my comments.

413
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,360
You can occur with Rob Walsh of podcast war on one podcast.

414
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,360
He had the, uh, the similar analysis.

415
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,360
And he really called out a lot of the journalists.

416
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,360
You know, I went back and read some of the, uh, some of the reports.

417
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,360
He sums them up quite nicely in his podcast.

418
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,360
Uh, and everyone's talking about season to cyst letters.

419
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,360
And you know, they'd never even seen the letter.

420
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
Hadn't it all?

421
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,360
And of course, the only way to really find out what is going on with this.

422
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,360
And who stands to gain or lose what and who's right and who's wrong.

423
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
Is to ask a lawyer.

424
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,360
Of course.

425
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,360
You're on her.

426
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,360
I'd like to make a motion to rock this mother out.

427
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,360
You're on her.

428
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,360
Please don't bang that gavel.

429
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,360
You can try this cowbell out.

430
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,360
Let's all give a nod.

431
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,360
To the hardest work and lawyer.

432
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,360
He's charging time.

433
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,360
And then he's charging time.

434
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
Yo, what's up, Adam?

435
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,360
It's Jersey Todd.

436
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,360
The host of the Jersey Todd show.

437
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,360
The official musicologist of the Cha Cha.

438
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
But listen.

439
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,360
I'm not here today to talk about food bar Friday or any of the good stuff happening over

440
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,360
the podcast.

441
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,360
Music network.

442
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,360
Note today, I'm here in my official capacity as the pod show pro bono attorney.

443
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,360
And while I've been listening to this wonderful discussion.

444
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,360
We've been having regarding the iPod trademark debate.

445
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
And listen, I got to thank you for your referral.

446
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,360
And I got to thank you for the bill.

447
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,360
I got to remind you of one really, really important thing.

448
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,360
Dude, I'm a worker's compensation attorney.

449
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,360
I chase ambulance this all day.

450
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,360
I mean, the last time that I messed around with copyright.

451
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,360
I was getting like a C plus on my final exam.

452
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,360
I mean, I have as much practical and working knowledge of copyright law as downtown Julie Brown.

453
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
So with a big wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble.

454
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
Let me give you my thoughts on the matter.

455
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,360
The first.

456
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
Oh, nice is that.

457
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,360
A lawyer who tells the truth that he doesn't know shit about what he's talking about.

458
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,360
Oh, it's so refreshing.

459
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,360
This thing is clearly Apple has filed a trademark on this.

460
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,360
It's enforceable and there's laws regarding it.

461
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,360
I mean, that's the stupid answer.

462
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,360
But when I, in hearing yesterday, sounded like you were saying that this was, you know,

463
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,360
not a cease and desist letter.

464
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,360
And this was actually kind of sort of nice of Apple to send a letter like this out.

465
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,360
I don't know how nice a letter it was.

466
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,360
Look, I don't think it was a letter that they sent out in preparation of suing somebody.

467
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,360
I think it's something that they want having their files down the road.

468
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,360
It's a letter that they send out to prevent something called a generic side.

469
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:32,360
You see, if a trademark holder fails to actively enforce their trademark, then the trademark could

470
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,360
fall into public domain and then anybody could use it.

471
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,360
Yeah, that's a great headline, isn't it?

472
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,360
That's a really good one.

473
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,360
Apple computer practices generic side.

474
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,360
Or do we practice generic side on Apple computer?

475
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,360
That's, yeah, that's the way it is.

476
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,360
Podcasting community exercises right of generic side on Apple computers.

477
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,360
For example, bear.

478
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,360
They originally copyrighted aspirin.

479
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,360
Uh, but the courts of ruled the United States that that trademark fell into public domain.

480
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
So other companies may use that name.

481
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,360
Uh, zerox for copiers and bandage for it.

482
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
He's a bandages.

483
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,360
Well, they're both trademarks, which are at risk of subcoming to a generic side.

484
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,360
So when it comes down to it, not necessarily a friendly letter, but not necessarily an unfriendly letter either.

485
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,360
It was a letter written by a corporation to make a hundred percent sure that they can control their trademarks

486
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,360
and their branding and protect themselves in the future.

487
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:32,360
And the folks with iPod want to make sure that the term pod doesn't entirely fall even more so into public domain.

488
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:38,360
And in some respects from what I can tell Apple is being extremely aggressive in maintaining this trademark.

489
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,360
So there you have it.

490
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,360
That's my two cents on it.

491
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
This is Jersey Todd of the Jersey Todd Show.

492
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,360
Oh crap.

493
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,360
Todd Show.

494
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,360
Todd Show.

495
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,360
Todd Show.

496
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
Oh, man.

497
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,360
I got to go.

498
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,360
Hey, listen, take it easy pod father with the podcast on the pod show with podcast delivery network.

499
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,360
Oh, man.

500
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,360
I freaking hate lawyers.

501
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
I love you, man.

502
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,360
Except for the part about the billable hours.

503
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
Everything else is cool.

504
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,360
Yeah, I agree.

505
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,360
Genericide.

506
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,360
Very good.

507
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
Yeah, that's true.

508
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,360
That's exactly what it's about.

509
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,360
And I agree with you.

510
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:16,360
Total consensus they're confer on the fact that Apple is using, you know, is doing this now because they have to.

511
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,360
To combat genericide.

512
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,360
And I don't foresee too many too many problems.

513
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,360
I don't.

514
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:30,360
It's just about doing stuff with actual mobile media devices and calling something pod around that.

515
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,360
That's going to be an issue.

516
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,360
And at the end of the day, whoever has the biggest lawyers is bound to win.

517
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,360
You know how that works.

518
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,360
But then again, can we just close this chapter?

519
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,360
I think we should.

520
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,360
I think I'm kind of done with it.

521
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,360
Those you're listening to us on serious stars.

522
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,360
One, two great line up for you today.

523
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,360
I'll tell you about that in a second.

524
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,360
And what you're not going to hear is another great pod safe.

525
00:24:53,360 --> 00:25:00,360
A music track, which the guys will actually, they've been nominated for a digital music award.

526
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,360
Too bad.

527
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,360
Because you guys will be able to hear it.

528
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,360
Wait a minute.

529
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,360
Let me just, I got one more thing about the, the iPod.

530
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,360
Just because it's a buddy.

531
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,360
I want to play Kevin Reeves, everybody.

532
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
Hey, animal candidates, Kevin Reeves.

533
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,360
And I've got a way in on this pod issue.

534
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,360
Because there's, there's some certain things about it that are completely ridiculous.

535
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:24,360
First of all, you said in the letter that Apple started using the term iPod.

536
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,360
And I told her of 2001.

537
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:37,360
And since then, they have been the first to blend a portable electronic device as being called pod.

538
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,360
Any musician listening?

539
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:45,360
Anybody else on a little kidney bean shape device from a company called Line 6 called Brace yourself?

540
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:51,360
The pod, which was outweighed before iPod ever came onto the scene.

541
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,360
I think I bought my pod used in string of 2000.

542
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,360
And it had been out for a couple months before that.

543
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,360
So come on, Apple, get real.

544
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,360
This is like the, the techno Gestapo here.

545
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,360
I mean, I love Apple.

546
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,360
I love my G4.

547
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:17,360
I love what they've been able to do for technology and for special musicians.

548
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,360
But, but come on, Apple, this is, this is, just get real.

549
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:28,360
The other problem is that they say that you can't use the word pod in any kind of electronic device.

550
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,360
They're going to pick off M audio.

551
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,360
Anyone own an M audio, fire pod.

552
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,360
Which is a sound card flash audio interface.

553
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,360
Sure, a lot of pod cache is a part of it, and use it.

554
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,360
So anyway, just, just thought I would put my 20 cents in.

555
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,360
And, uh, keep up the good work, dude.

556
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,360
And check me out at Kevin Reeves.net and the scourron shower.

557
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,360
Yeah, Kevin. Now, and you know what I like, you man.

558
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,360
I appreciate what you do.

559
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,360
And I love, I love your, your music.

560
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
I love your art.

561
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,360
Your work is fantastic.

562
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,360
But I think this is the kind of stuff we can do without.

563
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,360
I mean, this whole Apple thing, which started off unfairly with a really bad report from

564
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,360
Wired Magazine, talking about a cease and desist letter, which was not the case.

565
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,360
They had not even seen the letter in, in my regard otherwise.

566
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,360
Why would they even use those words?

567
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:24,360
It just creates this storm in a, in a, in a cup of tea, you know, a storm in a glass of water.

568
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,360
Is that the expression?

569
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,360
It's just, it just gives everyone a reason to fucking blog.

570
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,360
It's dumb.

571
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,360
And hopefully it'll stop now, but I have a feeling that the conversation will continue.

572
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,360
And it'll eventually, here's what's going to happen.

573
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:45,360
In a few weeks from now, you'll be able to see in Wikipedia under podcasting, because this is how it always goes.

574
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:51,360
Some version of the story that Apple computer is vehemently trying to register a podcast as a trademark.

575
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,360
Yeah, and it's just not the entire story.

576
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,360
And it's unfortunate, but that's the way it goes.

577
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
That's Apple's problem on my problem.

578
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,360
I've had that myself, those several times.

579
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:07,360
That's why bigger small, like the stick up for someone who's being falsely accused, particularly when the emotions run high.

580
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,360
All right, fucking.

581
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,360
Let's play some music, shall we?

582
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,360
