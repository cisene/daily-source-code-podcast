own all 27 episodes, the cult hit, including all new interviews with Carlton Koo.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,560
First thing that Brisco did that impressed us was, we're not only to come in and really read the dialogue well as an actor,

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,720
but he also did a standing flip in our office.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,640
You flipped too for Brisco County!

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,360

So you want to pound a full bar fold it?

9
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,360
I would have a DSC 474.

10
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,360
You just gotta keep it down in the side.

11
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,360
She won't wave you down, gotta leave it alone.

12
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,360
Keep it down in the side.

13
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:28,360
My eyes hurt and I can't just put it in the middle of my heart is hurt and I can't just carry on with down my eyes hurt and I can just carry on with down my eyes hurt and I can just carry on with down my eyes hurt and I can just carry on with down my eyes hurt and I can just carry on with down my eyes hurt and I can just carry on with down my eyes hurt and I can just carry on with down my eyes hurt.

14
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:35,360
My eyes hurt and I can just carry on with down my eyes hurt and I can just carry on with down.

15
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,360
Hey ... don't get mad ...

16
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,360
How can you resist that?

17
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,360
Okay...

18
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,360
There's a healer, you just gotta keep it down inside

19
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,360
She won't write me down, gotta leave it alone

20
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,360
Keep it down inside

21
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,360
She won't bring me down, gotta leave it alone

22
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,360
Keep it down inside

23
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:27,360
I guess I didn't want to keep such a fool in my damn heart

24
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,360
She went in, I guess I just didn't drag it my damn heart

25
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,360
I didn't take it, because you just didn't want me down

26
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,360
I guess I just didn't drag it my damn heart

27
00:03:50,360 --> 00:04:05,360
I'm sorry, but you can really just use some cowbell

28
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,360
I need to explore the studio space

29
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:24,360
My head is hurting, because you're still pulling me down

30
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,360
My heart is hurting, because you're still dragging me down

31
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,360
I guess I just didn't want to keep such a fool in my damn heart

32
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,360
She went in, I guess I just didn't drag it my damn heart

33
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,360
I guess I just didn't want to keep such a fool in my damn heart

34
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,360
She went in, I guess I just didn't drag it my damn heart

35
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,360
I guess I just didn't want to keep such a fool in my damn heart

36
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:01,360
I guess I just didn't want to keep such a fool in my damn heart

37
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,360
I guess I just didn't want to keep such a fool in my damn heart

38
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,360
I know for matter the wonderful winner of 2006 Digital Music Award for Best Unsigned Band

39
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,360
Now available on the Podsafe Music Network

40
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Hey everybody, how you doing? Welcome to the Daily Source Code episode

41
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,360
About 474 coming to you from Curry Cottage on a very rainy Friday afternoon

42
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,360
But it is Fubard

43
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,360
That's right, Fox Todd Uniform Bravo Alpharomia

44
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,360
We are fucked up beyond all repair, which means it's going to be great show

45
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,360
Jersey Todd's got some cool tunes, actually two songs instigated by Jersey Todd

46
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,360
They're all podsafes, so they're all just fantastic

47
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,360
The wonderfuls, which you just heard, they performed live at the Digital Music Award 2006 Fantastic

48
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,360
It was great because they were just like, hey, we feel kind of out of place here

49
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,360
We've got like no money, no nothing, no record deal

50
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,360
And they're the other going to be on the live telecast on the 21st of October

51
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,360
I think that's Saturday, some got awful time midnight

52
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:10,360
But they'll be on, and of course podsafes music network attendance means that any podcaster can play their songs

53
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,360
And they got another one up there called the Hillbilly song Cool Band from Brighton in the UK

54
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,360
Hey, damn, it's been busy, sorry about yesterday

55
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,360
There was just no way I was going to be able to do a show had to be in pretty early

56
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,360
As I said, we're doing all kinds of meetings, getting pod show UK up and running

57
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,360
Ready to launch in just weeks from now, of course we've kind of already unleashed

58
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:37,360
And we've been soliciting creative input from podcasters and other creative people in general

59
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,360
Through BTpodshow.com, we did our live from London

60
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:49,360
We missed that, the live part that is, we're going to have a number of different segments and feeds for you to subscribe to all leading up

61
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,360
Of course to the telecast, and just cool if you want to go back and look at Peter Gabriel yelling at us

62
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,360
Ah, so some good stuff, let me see, feedback first from, oh, haven't heard from this guy quite a while

63
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:13,360
Comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip

64
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,360
And CSB's got something new on his mind today, yes new opportunities for him

65
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:26,360
Yeah, ah, Adam Kerry, God bless America, the American dream is still a live dear green go

66
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:38,360
I wanted to remind all listeners of CSC who are not US citizens that United States, green card lottery 2006 began October 4

67
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,360
And we last till December 3

68
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:55,360
And you can submit the application only through the website and remind everybody that only the website with dot goz at the end of the internet

69
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,360
The internet domain is the official website, yes, I am citizen and fan of European Union

70
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:10,360
But I apply to this green card lottery to get US citizenship each year to myself

71
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:20,360
Just imagine that Adam, oh yeah, if I would win, I would call you my compatiot, wouldn't it be great

72
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,360
Yeah, so right, the green card lottery is on, we'll good luck to you

73
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,360
CSB there, many other ways you can become an American citizen, by the way, if you're serious about it

74
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,360
I'm sure we'd welcome you, I don't know if they do throw background checks, that could be rather difficult

75
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Yeah, the end of the week, save my ass

76
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,360
Here's any mess

77
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,360
Come on, come on in, help me out with that ass

78
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,360
Adam, yes, it's been a short week ever, it seems like we just asked her side

79
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
Yeah, time to do it again

80
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,360
So, since you're warmed up, let's get started

81
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,360
Okay, do any of my mind?

82
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
We're down on our knees today

83
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
Okay, you might call on a second

84
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,360
You need to be on your knees, I'm on my knees

85
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,360
I'm on my knees with your hands at your side

86
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
Hands at my side, okay

87
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Okay, leave your left side and hold yourself up with your left hand

88
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
What?

89
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Good, now take your right leg

90
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
Oh, okay

91
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Straighten it out to the right and push it up toward the ceiling

92
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
Oh, please

93
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
Your right arm should be reaching for the sky

94
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
Okay, it is

95
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Now, if you're right leg, do eight little circles forward

96
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,360
Eight, seven, six, five

97
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
Oh, I feel it

98
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,360
Three, two, three

99
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
I understand

100
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
And three

101
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Okay

102
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
And then eight little circles backward

103
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
Oh, backwards

104
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,360
Eight, seven, six, five

105
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
I can feel this

106
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
Three, two, one

107
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
I look like a dog

108
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,360
King against the tree

109
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
Okay, left

110
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Clean over to the right

111
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,360
And use the right hand for stability

112
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
Okay

113
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
Left leg, out enough

114
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,360
Left arm to the sky

115
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,360
And eight forward circles

116
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Eight, seven, six, five

117
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,360
Oh, three, two, one

118
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,360
I kind of burned down eight circles backward

119
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
Okay

120
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
I'm really doing this

121
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Six, five, four, six

122
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
Two, one

123
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Thank you

124
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
Fantastic

125
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
Done?

126
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
How are we doing?

127
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
I'm painless

128
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Please tell me I'm done

129
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,360
We should do exercise live next week

Since you'll be in San Francisco

131
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Okay

132
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
That is if you dare

133
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
Uh-huh

134
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,360

Starting down the gauntlet

144
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
Mm-hmm

145
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
Okay

You know what?

148
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
It does make a difference

149
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
I'm getting good reports back

150
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,360
From the women folk here at Ter Curry Cottage

151
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
Indeed

152
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,360
The ass is becoming viewable again

153
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,360
Hey Adam, this is Tom Rockold

154
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,360
From BuckeyeDriveDive.com.ca

155
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,360
Drive it around here

156
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
The center is the universe

157
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
Listen to GFC 473

158
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
And you're talking about naked pictures

159
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
That Michael Butler has

160
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
But yeah

Yeah

00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
And you couldn't come up with the word

164
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Okay

165
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,360
I got a lot of email about this

166
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,360
I couldn't believe I couldn't come up with the word

167
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
Either when someone is holding something back

168
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,360
Cannot believe that you couldn't come up

169
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
Use specifically

170
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Couldn't come up with the word

171
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
Bogueard

172
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,360
Michael Butler is Bogueard

Gardening

174
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
Boguearding

175
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,360
Boguearding

176
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,360
But kind of scrunched curious

177
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,360
Oh scrunched curious

178
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,360
Oh, we have a new category

179
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,360
Yeah, that was pretty stupid

180
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
You know why?

181
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
Because it's not in my DNA

182
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
To Bogueard

183
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
That's why

184
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,360
I come from the Amsterdam

185
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,360
And

186
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,360
Montego Bay School of Erb

187
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,360
And because of the Bountiful

188
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Plentiful amounts available

189
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
We don't have to share like in the US

190
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
You know, we have passed it along

191
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,360
And this is how an American smokes week

192
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,360
You know, in Jamaica

193
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
It's just like we have to hold the Erb

194
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
And we just kind of smoke it

195
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
And it goes out, man

196
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
And we like it again

197
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
With a lighter

198
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,360
And Amsterdam is the same thing

199
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
You know, it's so cheap

200
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,360
So readily available

201
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
No big deal

202
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
No reason to Bogueard

203
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
So it's as I said

204
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
It's just not in the DNA at all

205
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
Let me see

206
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,360
What can I tell you about yesterday?

207
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
Oh yes, yesterday

208
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,360
I got a demo of the BT Vision

209
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,360
System

210
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,360
This is the IPTV

211
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Box that there's been talked about

212
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Quite a bit here in the UK

213
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
And I have to say

214
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
I was impressed

215
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Now I have a skyploss

216
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
Which is

217
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
I guess kind of the

218
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Equivalent of

219
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,360
Direct TV with with Tvo capabilities

220
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,360
You know, satellite little satellite

221
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Dish on the roof

222
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,360
So this is a BT Vision thing

223
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
We pretty cool

224
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,360
You plug it into two places

225
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Initially you plug it into

226
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
And by the way you get a

227
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
I guess a guy comes to your home

228
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
And installs it

229
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
It's you plug it into your aerial

230
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
Your antenna on the roof

231
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,360
Which just about every single house in the UK

232
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
Still has

233
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
So you can get your free view

234
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
Which we've discussed before

235
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
I don't know, it's like 30 or 40 channels

236
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
Of a digital television

237
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
And what I saw yesterday

238
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
I looked pretty damn stupid

239
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,360
And then you plug the other end

240
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,360
Into your DSL line

241
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
And from there you'll be able to

242
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Get all kinds of stuff on demand

243
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Pre-recorded programs

244
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
Of course there's stuff that's already

245
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
You can record yourself

246
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
And the one thing I really liked about

247
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
The interface

248
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,360
Is unlike if anyone living in the UK

249
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,360
Of the 8 million people using sky

250
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,360
You'll know how

251
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,360
Fucking horrible this is

252
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
When you go to the program guide

253
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,360
And sky

254
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Not only does it not overlay

255
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
The program guide on top of the picture

256
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,360
You're watching now

257
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,360
So you could kind of see what you know

258
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
Keep track of the program that you're watching

259
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
Or see if the commercial is ended

260
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
But it's usually when we switch

261
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
It throws it full screen

262
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
And they bring up some fucking music

263
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,360
It's just some horrible background music

264
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,360
For the program guide

265
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,360
Where of course you want to hear the program that you're still watching

266
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
So stupid

267
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
So they've got that right

268
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,360
And something else really interesting

269
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
I don't know how much I can talk about this

270
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,360
And of course our partnership

271
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
Includes all kinds of non-disclosures

272
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,360
But I'm just so excited that

273
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,360
It looks like I don't know if it'll be the initial release

274
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Or whenever

275
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
But it looks like they'll be

276
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
Experimenting with

277
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
Internet networking

278
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
Throughout the home

279
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Through power lines

280
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
How cool is that?

281
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,360
So you basically you can plug

282
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
Anything into a wall socket

283
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,360
You could take this free

284
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,360
This BT vision box

285
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
You can plug it into a wall socket

286
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,360
And it doesn't matter where your DSL line is located

287
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,360
It'll just work

288
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
It'll just work right through the power supply

289
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,360
I thought it was pretty neat

290
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,360
And so I'm very excited about what we saw

291
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
And obviously I'm looking at that saying

292
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
Hey, what can we do with it?

293
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Well, check this out

294
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,360
You'll be very happy to know

295
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,360
That the video format

296
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,360
Of course it eats MP3's

297
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
No problem

298
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,360
But the video format is MP4

299
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Using the H.264 codec

300
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,360
So it's like exactly the stuff

301
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,360
That we're using in video podcasting

302
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
It's so cool

303
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,360
So cool

304
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,360
So cool

305
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,360
So cool

306
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
So cool

307
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
So cool

308
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,360
So cool

309
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,360
So cool

310
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
So cool

311
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
So cool

312
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,360

So cool

314

So cool

315
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
So cool

316
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
So cool

317
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
So cool

318
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,360

370
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,360
So cool

371
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,360
So cool

372
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
So cool

373
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
So cool

374
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,360
So cool

375
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,360
So cool

376
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,360
So cool

377
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,360
So cool

378
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,360
So cool

379
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,360
So cool

380
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,360
So cool

381
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
Now

382
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,360
Now

383
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
I can just don't pay you

384
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,360
Everybody in the house

385
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,360
We're ready for our living

386
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,360
You say you are

387
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,360
Oh, oh, oh

388
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,360
Hey

389
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,360
Yeah

390
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,360
Yeah

391
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,360
Yeah

392
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,360
Fuck the meter

393
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Stop, stop, stop, stop

394
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,360
Let's do all theおお

395
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,360
Don't stop, stop

396
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
Stop, stop, stop

397
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,360
Let's do all the way there

398
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
Turn around

399
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
So I could be caught too

400
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
We've gained zoned a line

401
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
Let's take it out

402
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,360
Skown

403
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,360
The bad place of tools

404
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,360
Oh then I'm up you

405
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,360
Stop, don't break this thing

406
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,360
You know I know you

407
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,780
You are your heart, too. You know we're getting hard

408
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,260
But once we're getting the back up, we're going to the witty car

409
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,660
It's not the 20 yards, they call their ramps on

410
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,860
Give it up for the team so we're getting it hard

411
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,860
One, two, three, here

412
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,260
We go make one, think real clear

413
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,660
To all my people getting down right here

414
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,660
We go party like this, all these

415
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,360
So don't know, there's another year

416
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,860
Come way more like it's just no greater

417
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,360
Everybody in our city ready to party

418
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,860
Let me hear something, oh, oh

419
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,860
Yeah

420
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,860
That's the water, what?

421
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,860
Wow bunch, stomp, stomp the bleachers

422
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,860
Now also on the pod save music network

423
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,860
Thank you very much, Jersey Todd, for unleashing that into the network

424
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,860
And also want to thank Michael Butler of course

425
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,860
And his counterpart in the UK, Jill Mills

426
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,860
Who have been working so diligently on making people aware of the pod save music

427
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,860
Now we're helping bands independent labels

428
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,860
And also some rather mainstream labels try it out

429
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,860
And see if we can make it work with this

430
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,860
Funky thing we call pod casting and turns out

431
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,860
Oh shit, yeah, it works

432
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,860
By the way, Jill Mills

433
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,860
Who really is the Michael Butler over here in the UK

434
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,860
Some subtle differences, she smells a lot nicer

435
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,860
She's not quite as bony

436
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,860
I like, I love you, man

437
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,860
And we were at London Live

438
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,860
And this is just all these bands coming in

439
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,860
And we're interviewing, we got, we had OJ

440
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,860
That would be the UK OJ, not OJ

441
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,860
Simpsonson, but OJ was one of our one of our host for London Live

442
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,860
And Olivia interviewing people

443
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,860
And then Peter Gabriel comes down the red carpet

444
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,860
And he goes, hey Jill and Jill, say come on in

445
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,860
Let's do an interview over here for a pod show on the live

446
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,860
Yeah, no problem

447
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,860
It was like, okay, wait to go Jill, definitely

448
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,860
Very, very cool

449
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,860
I got some other cool things I wanted to tell you about what we're doing over here

450
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,860
Which I think can easily be replicated in the US

451
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,860
But first

452
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,860
One, two, one, six, two, five

453
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,860
Six, three, five, seven, one

454
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,860
Five, six, three, five

455
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,860
Five, six, two, five, six, three, five

456
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,860
Five, seven, nine, five

457
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:41,860
Five, six, two, five, six, three, five

458
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,860
I love it when you guys make stuff for me

459
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,860
That's like a present every morning I wake up

460
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,860
Like, oh, look, there's new intros to the show

461
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,860
How does it a new voice-mail jingle?

462
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,860
I love it, thank you so much

463
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,860
Hey, I'm locked out of the podcast

464
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,860
Don't be here, I heard something yesterday

465
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,860
On the polar bear podcast hosted by Andy

466
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:05,860
And I'm 99% sure it's not true

467
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,860
But I just wanted to check with the source

468
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,860
And make sure he said that he heard a rumor

469
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,860
That podcasts are outside of the pod show

470
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:22,860
Plus, soon we'll not have access to the pod safe music network

471
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,860
And I just can't imagine that ever happening

472
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,860
It would just, anyway, if you were to dress as leaders

473
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,860
Shoot me to email or talk about it a little bit on your show

474
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,860
I'm not precured, thanks man, bye

475
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,860
Is it just a feeble attempt to promoing your show on the Charlie?

476
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,860
What is that?

477
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,860
Let's stoop it!

478
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,860
I would make no sense at all, now I would it

479
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,860
Oh man

480
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,860
It's like, it's sometimes, and a lot of this happens in the blogosphere

481
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:56,860
And it's, it's, it used to be frustrating now

482
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,860
I just have to laugh at all, it's conspiracy theories

483
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,860
Really, all of it, no, of course not

484
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,860
Pod safe music network stands on its own dude

485
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,860
And even though pod show funds it heavily

486
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,860
Because, you know, it's a resource that does cost money

487
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,860
We've got full-time people working on it, keeping it running, cost bandwidth, etc

488
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,860
And we love it

489
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,860
It enables more content to flow throughout pod casting

490
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,860
And independently produced independent productions, period

491
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,860
You know, where the license is built right in

492
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,860
It would be very stupid for us to try and lock that in

493
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,860
There's no sense whatsoever

494
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,860
It's almost like, so I'm sure you if you're in the blogosphere

495
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:42,860
Then you could not have missed Jason Calacanis's comments about the Gilmour gang

496
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,860
That this was, you know, the adab would never let it on the air

497
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,860
Steve Gilmour would never dare to put up the show on edited

498
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,860
And of course, you know, the show where all of the quote analysts on the show

499
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,860
I would just have to say the guys on the call on the conference call

500
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,860
The best shows in a long time I have to say

501
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,860
You know, how stupid is that?

502
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,860
To think that I wouldn't allow a show to go up

503
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,860
Even stupid to think that I have that right

504
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,860
This is what you got to understand

505
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,860
And maybe just have to rewind a little bit back to the basics

506
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,860
Because people really have come up with some interesting ideas

507
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,860
Of what pod show is about and how we work with our partners

508
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,860
Who are independent producers we have no say over final content

509
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,860
We have no say over what you put up

510
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,860
The producers are individually responsible

511
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,860
Steve Gilmour is responsible for his show

512
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,860
He's responsible for the content of the show

513
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,860
He's responsible for anything that he puts on his show

514
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,860
He's responsible for what he says

515
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,860
He's responsible for everything

516
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:50,860
And he's also responsible for cutting it up into five different segments

517
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,860
Do you hear me there?

518
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,860
Little geek nerdy boy?

519
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,860
Todd Cochran

520
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,860
Todd, you are such a conspiracy theorist man

521
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,860
Steve Gilmour thinks it's a smart way to do it

522
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,860
I disagree, I've been pretty vocal about that

523
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,860
And his choices are his

524
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,860
As with any producer who works with pod show

525
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,860
And you may notice that he has the same four minutes of commercials

526
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,860
At the beginning of every show

527
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,860
I'm not a big fan of that at all

528
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,860
I think it really doesn't serve the purpose

529
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,860
And I think he should be integrating that into a show in a whole different way

530
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,860
But that's his decision

531
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,860
Now you notice he has the same advertisers

532
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,860
He's not getting a lot more

533
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,860
Advertising business because

534
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,860
We can only sell so much

535
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,860
And if he decides to do it that way

536
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,860
That's his foretaste

537
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,860
That's his prerogative

538
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,860
He can do whatever he wants

539
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,860
But you know

540
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,860
Then he may

541
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,860
You know

542
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,860
May not get a lot of new sponsors

543
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,860
To me it's almost sounds like he's phoning some of that stuff in

544
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,860
And I know it's four minutes and everybody knows it's four minutes

545
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,860
And we pretty much all skip past the first four minutes

546
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,860
On the other hand

547
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,860
Even I'm the we have those brisco county junior ads running right now

548
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,860
I want to make a new one

549
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,860
I'll make one please

550
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,860
I do not like the one that's running

551
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,860
And you know this is how we try to do it

552
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,860
We're changing

553
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,860
Media we have different distribution

554
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,860
We have different ways to produce

555
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,860
We're people are producing independently

556
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,860
With no Uber lords

557
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,860
Telling on what they can do

558
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,860
At the same time we also have to change advertising

559
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,860
That's not entirely within our control

560
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,860
We've had some good successes

561
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,860
You know look at the earthlink ad challenge

562
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,860
We've had some great promotions

563
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,860
Running throughout the network

564
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,860
I think the accurate target cast is fantastic

565
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,860
And you know

566
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,860
Not everyone sees eye to eye

567
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,860
But we still got a sell

568
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,860
We still got to make money come in

569
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,860
Because we are paying people

570
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,860
Anyway

571
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,860
Okay

572
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,860
So the other cool thing about British telecom

573
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,860
I want to talk about

574
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,860
Unfortunately those of you listening to serious

575
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,860
Satellite stars one or two won't be able to hear

576
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,860
Because I just got a couple seconds left

577
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,860
But you do have another three and a half hours

578
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,860
Of a pod show on serious coming your way

579
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,860
For this food bar Friday

580
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,860
And I personally will talk to you guys again

581
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,860
On Monday on the source code

582
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,860
Now before I get to

583
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,860
To the other bit of news I want to talk about

584
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,860
This is still more of a feedback coming in from the UK

585
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,860
Check the sound

586
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,860
The ad and it's the doctor here from the blood cast

587
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,860
I get the wrong address last time I've shown them

588
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,860
It's the blood dot com slash cast

589
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,860
I've cracked as that

590
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,860
Anyway

591
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,860
I'm just sitting here on a

592
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,860
Actually Thursday morning

593
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,860
This was Wednesday show

594
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,860
Are you talking about the distribution board

595
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,860
I just pulled us away

596
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,860
You say you didn't use the podcasting

597
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,860
Twenty in Britain

598
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,860
It helped you out with some of the videos

599
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,860
Starts and all that kind of things

600
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,860
I think that's what it's saying

601
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,860
And what was that?

602
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,860
Ah okay

603
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,860
Doctor

604
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,860
Why do you always call me when you're on the street

605
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,860
Could you please call me from a quiet place

606
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,860
It's so hard to understand what you're saying

607
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,860
It's probably because you don't want

608
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,860
Cossow to hear that you call me right?

609
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,860
Well, of course we've been soliciting

610
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,860
Any kind of creative

611
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,860
Input feedback, talent, production, etc

612
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,860
For several weeks

613
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,860
On BTpodshow.com

614
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,860
I believe that there's some cynicism

615
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,860
In the quote podcasting community

616
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,860
And people have a very much weight and sea approach

617
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,860
And attitude because we just didn't receive

618
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,860
All that much from

619
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,860
The podcasting community

620
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,860
You know, we received a lot of stuff from other people

621
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,860
Who want to be host, comedians,

622
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,860
A lot of comedians, a lot of comedians

623
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,860
Unlike the US

624
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,860
A lot of comedians

625
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,860
Want to get into independent productions

626
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,860
Here in the UK

627
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,860
Very interesting

628
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,860
So we definitely have made some great relationships

629
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,860
But when we saw this kind of weight and back

630
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,860
Hold back, weight and sea attitude

631
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,860
We really went as wide as we could

632
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,860
And we really cast our net as wide as we possibly could

633
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,860
And said, hey, you know, if you got anything

634
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,860
Once you come on down

635
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,860
And show us your wares

636
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,860
And that was a big part of the condition

637
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,860
And of course anyone would have been welcome

638
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,860
So there's been, you know, we've had

639
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,860
Think a couple thousand different submissions

640
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,860
Through BTpodshow.com

641
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,860
A lot of it video

642
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,860
I have to say, interestingly enough

643
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,860
But also music

644
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,860
And some

645
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,860
You know, audio productions

646
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,860
Not necessarily podcast

647
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,860
So it's not like we didn't want to

648
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,860
That's kind of what the kind of the vibe that we received

649
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,860
And as it turns out

650
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,860
It was very interesting to have

651
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,860
This enormous

652
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,860
New audience

653
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,860
I consider people who produce to be audience as well

654
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,860
Senseo

655
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,860
Senseo moment brought to you by pdbtpodshow.com

656
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,860
It was great to see people saying, hey, what the hell is this?

657
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,860
I was doing something cool

658
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,860
We're basically introducing people

659
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,860
To the whole concept

660
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,860
Which you could call podcasting

661
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,860
But I just like to say it's independent productions

662
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,860
And it's producing

663
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,860
And it's monetizing

664
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,860
And it's having a shitload of fun

665
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,860
Secondly,

666
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,860
Think of the nominations

667
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,860
Interesting at the podcast

668
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,860
Tapestry was sort of mostly non-independent for cartoons

669
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,860
Yeah, that is a shame

670
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,860
But you did the nominating

671
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,860
And yeah

672
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,860
We entered into the digital music awards

673
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,860
Rather laid into the process

674
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,860
It's the second year

675
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,860
But just telecom was sponsoring them

676
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,860
It's basically their show

677
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,860
They pay for it

678
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,860
And they make sure that there's a show

679
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,860
And that people are nominated

680
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,860
And that there's winners and actual trophies

681
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,860
And shit

682
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,860
And that it gets aired on Channel 4

683
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,860
And we entered into that process

684
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,860
Pretty late

685
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,860
Nominations had already been cast

686
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,860
By a

687
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,860
It's on the way

688
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,860
It's on the way

689
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,860
It's on the way

690
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,860
It's on the way

691
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,860
It's on the way

692
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,860
It's on the website dma2006.com

693
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,860
The nominations had pretty much been set in stone

694
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,860
What was interesting is

695
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,860
There was one nominee who was independent

696
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,860
And that was London electricity

697
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,860
And I can tell you

698
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,860
London electricity won

699
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,860
And I don't know if

700
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,860
If the actual votes are tabulated anywhere

701
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,860
Because it was a people's choice award

702
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,860
Not by nomination

703
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,860
So they couldn't nominate

704
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,860
But they could vote

705
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,860
And it was like

706
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,860
Twenty to one for the independent

707
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,860
So that was the great news about it

708
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,860
And believe me

709
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,860
We were somewhat dismayed

710
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,860
That it did indeed seem to be

711
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,860
Just about a whole bunch of mainstream

712
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,860
In fact when you see the telecast

713
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,860
On the 21st

714
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,860
I actually said that

715
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,860
But I believe the landscape

716
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,860
We very different

717
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,860
Get next year for the

718
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,860
For the best podcast of the year

719
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,860
At Digital Music Awards 2007

720
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,860
So

721
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,860
And the premonition

722
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,860
Pretty much came true

723
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,860
There you had it

724
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,860
It was

725
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,860
It was an independent podcast

726
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,860
That won the category

727
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,860
Hi Adam

728
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,860
This is Tania

729
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,860
We're walking down here

730
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,860
In the short

731
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,860
There's no more

732
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,860
It's just something I've never heard of it

733
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,860
It's a little beach in Southern Ireland

734
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,860
I'll let you adjust for a second

735
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,860
It takes a second

736
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,860
When you all of a sudden you hear

737
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,860
An Irish voice coming from the States

738
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,860
Like, okay

739
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,860
You got to get into the rhythm

740
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,860
Got to get into the kind of

741
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,860
The song

742
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,860
It's the way she talks

743
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,860
And here we go

744
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,860
Coming in here because

745
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,860
But I'm a student college

746
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,860
We've a show called

747
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,860
TalkCassen.au

748
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,860
I came across your show

749
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,860
I fried off in this room

750
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,860
To the Charlie with my

751
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,860
On my I thought walking along

752
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,860
I love it

753
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,860
When you listen to the Charlie

754
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,860
On your iPod

755
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,860
Walking along with your lucky charms

756
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,860
I found a question for you

757
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,860
Not before you also

758
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,860
Make for some shots

759
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,860
I want to put this to you

760
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,860
It's so sexy

761
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,860
I have a question for you

762
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,860
I want to put it to you

763
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,860
I want to put it to you baby

764
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,860
I'm

765
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,860
BT Parkhouse

766
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,860
What I'm just wondering

767
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,860
Why is this limited

768
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,860
Just to

769
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,860
To the BT market

770
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,860
People within the UK

771
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,860
Beats that say

772
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,860
Well

773
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,860
No one in Ireland

774
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,860
Actually one of the most popular

775
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,860
I must have

776
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,860
I'm a BT customer

777
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,860
And find a broadband services

778
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,860
One and so much better

779
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,860
I see that the general people within Ireland

780
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,860
There's so much challenge

781
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,860
I see it can be quite

782
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,860
Losing out on this

783
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,860
We're trying to change things

784
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,860
In a life at the moment

785
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,860
Might mean myself

786
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,860
First I'm a scruncher

787
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,860
Trying to bring the kids up

788
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,860
To be a soul

789
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,860
Or that can be

790
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,860
A bit of a challenge

791
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,860
As you probably know

792
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,860
You do have any children

793
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,860
But it's just something

794
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,860
I'd like you to think about

795
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,860
That's a large market within Ireland

796
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,860
Just small little islands

797
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,860
We do have quite a lot of talents here

798
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,860
And it's actually growing quite a lot

799
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,860
Thank you

800
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,860
I'm not a benefit to you

801
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,860
If you could maybe even think about

802
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,860
Just spreading the word

803
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,860
Share our country

804
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,860
Bye

805
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,860
Darling

806
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,860
Darling

807
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,860
I'll pay my food

808
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,860
Will you take your clothes off

809
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,860
I'm just having fun with you

810
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,860
Hey

811
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,860
First of all

812
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,860
What we're doing in the UK

813
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,860
It's podshow UK

814
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,860
Okay

815
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,860
BT podshow.com

816
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,860
But BT is rolling out

817
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,860
Wherever they have a presence

818
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,860
And of course

819
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,860
They're in Ireland

820
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,860
You'll see all kinds of marketing initiatives

821
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,860
In Ireland as well

822
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,860
Absolutely

823
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,860
What is

824
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,860
And why do you think that we're excluding you

825
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,860
We're not excluding you at all

826
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,860
You're excluding yourself

827
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,860
So no, of course not

828
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,860
More than welcome

829
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,860
And it absolutely includes Ireland

830
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,860
It includes

831
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,860
It includes Guernsey

832
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,860
If you wanted to

833
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,860
That's beyond the point

834
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,860
But anywhere British telecom

835
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,860
Is

836
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,860
They're going to really roll this out

837
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,860
And really promote it

838
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,860
And market it

839
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,860
So that will include Ireland

840
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,860
Absolutely

841
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,860
Send your stuff in girl

842
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,860
Come on

843
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,860
What are you waiting for

844
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,860
So Gavin Patterson

845
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,860
He's the

846
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,860
He's like the new

847
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,860
He's the boss over

848
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,860
BT retail

849
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,860
He's really the

850
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,860
Above him you've got

851
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,860
See you got Ian

852
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,860
I've been

853
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,860
So really Gavin is

854
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,860
You know is the top guy

855
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,860
For what we're doing in the UK

856
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,860
And he's young guy

857
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,860
He's younger than I am

858
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,860
I believe

859
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,860
And as you know

860
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,860
Patricia thinks he's cute

861
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,860
Which some other women

862
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,860
Who had heard that particular show

863
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,860
With the lady Patricia

864
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,860
Also agreed to

865
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,860
I found the digital musical

866
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,860
Words

867
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,860
So he mentioned a couple times

868
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,860
They have the studio downstairs

869
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,860
Because we actually taped a bit with him

870
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,860
For a press release

871
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,860
And they have a full-blown

872
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,860
Fucking studio

873
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,860
Downstairs

874
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,860
In the BT building

875
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,860
At their headquarters

876
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,860
And not only do they have a studio

877
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,860
With a proper control room

878
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,860
It's completely digital

879
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,860
Right down to Final Cut Pro

880
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,860
If you want to record something on that

881
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,860
But it's multi camera

882
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,860
And they have an auditorium

883
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,860
Right next to it

884
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,860
They use this stuff for like corporate

885
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,860
Videos and you know for shareholder

886
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,860
Meetings and stuff like that

887
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,860
And when I saw the studio

888
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,860
A couple weeks ago

889
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,860
I said Gavin man

890
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,860
I want to use this

891
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,860
He said well shit

892
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,860
You should because

893
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,860
It's like it's only used for boring stuff

894
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,860
So here's the plan

895
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,860
We're going to do a daily show

896
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,860
We're going to hijack

897
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,860
The British Telecom headquarters

898
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,860
And it'll really work

899
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,860
Because we can get guests in

900
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,860
We can get him

901
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,860
What the hell was that?

902
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,860
Oh, today's size

903
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,860
Vacuuming

904
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,860
We can get people in easily

905
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,860
Through the front door

906
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,860
We can book guests

907
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,860
There's dressing rooms

908
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,860
It's a full-blown piece of

909
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,860
KIT and we don't have to pay for it

910
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,860
It's like an internal line item

911
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,860
So I'm really excited about

912
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,860
You know this daily show

913
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,860
That we're cooking up

914
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,860
It's going to be

915
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,860
I believe we're going to do it live

916
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,860
Of course it'll be

917
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,860
You know also available as a download

918
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,860
But would it be cool to continue live

919
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,860
From London and do it from this corporate

920
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,860
Headquarters and basically hijack the studio

921
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,860
Just do some wicked ass shit

922
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,860
Yeah

923
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,860
Keep watching this space baby

924
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,860
Hey Adam this is Paul Smith

925
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,860
I just sent your email regarding

926
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,860
Pictures not showing up on Adam.podshow.com

927
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,860
I'm currently using IE6

928
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,860
And I've tried it on multiple computers

929
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,860
I've logged in and logged out

930
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,860
And interestingly enough

931
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,860
If I am the same computer

932
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,860
Use the latest version of

933
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,860
Mozilla

934
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,860
It doesn't happen

935
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,860
And if I go and I look at the properties

936
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,860
For the picture or the image

937
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,860
That's not showing up

938
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,860
I figured this out

939
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,860
The just now is I'm listening to it

940
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,860
Paul I do appreciate you sending in

941
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,860
Audio comment about this

942
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,860
I believe

943
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,860
Unless we've all of a sudden

944
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,860
Broken IE6

945
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,860
Which doesn't

946
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,860
It doesn't sound right

947
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,860
I believe it's a plugin thing

948
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,860
Let me see

949
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,860
It says it's looking for

950
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,860
HTTP colon slash slash

951
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,860
Sound seeing tours.podshow.com

952
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,860
Ford slash WP images

953
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,860
Ford slash Adam

954
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,860
Mark header

955
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,860
Yeah

956
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,860
SWF

957
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,860
Dot SWF

958
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,860
Right

959
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,860
So either one of two things happened

960
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,860
Either that particular server went down

961
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,860
When you were looking at the page

962
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,860
Which I doubt because it's working for me

963
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,860
In fact if you go to curry.com

964
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,860
You should in IE6

965
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,860
I guess or whatever

966
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,860
You should see the same problem

967
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,860
Because that's a flash movie

968
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,860
So no wonder you know you're having problems

969
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,860
Try reinstalling the

970
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,860
Flash plugins

971
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,860
And I'll check with engineering as well

972
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,860
Because you know that should be automatic

973
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,860
And if you have the wrong plugin

974
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,860
We should detect that

975
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,860
And we should help you download the right one

976
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,860
So I'll look into that from our side

977
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,860
You said that Mozilla was no problem

978
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,860
So I think that is just a flash plugin issue

979
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,860
Which usually is kind of automatic

980
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,860
And is always up to date

981
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,860
But a crap man

982
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,860
It's the internet

983
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,860
Hi Adam

984
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,860
It's Karen from Rumor Girl

985
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,860
Baby

986
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,860
Karen

987
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,860
Not Mary

988
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,860
Okay

989
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,860
I know what's coming

990
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,860
I'm sorry I fucked up the other day

991
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,860
Thanks for talking about us on the daily source code

992
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,860
Today

993
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,860
But you mentioned that you saw Mary and Carla

994
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,860
In the pool from Rumor Girl

995
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,860
Yeah

996
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,860
Karen and Carla

997
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,860
I don't feel that everybody is mentioned that

998
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,860
That time at the point that I'm going to call you Mary

999
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,860
So next is your my teacher is going to say

1000
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,860
I'm not Mary, damn it

1001
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1002
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,860
I'm sorry

1003
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,860
That's fine, I don't mind it all

1004
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,860
But um

1005
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,860
I loved it

1006
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,860
Had a great time

1007
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,860
That the seven hottest women of pod show

1008
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,860
Including me and Carla

1009
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:27,860
And we've got pictures on RumorGirls.pot show.com

1010
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,860
You can check that out

1011
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,860
And just wanted to say hey

1012
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,860
And sorry we missed you

1013
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,860
But maybe next year

1014
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,860
Top 2 later

1015
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,860
Bye

1016
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,860
And I don't folder or scruncher

1017
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,860
Hmm

1018
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,860
I don't know how

1019
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,860
By the way, I wonder if both Karen and Carla

1020
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,860
Or folders or scrunchers

1021
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,860
I peg

1022
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,860
I peg Carla as a scruncher

1023
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,860
Actually

1024
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,860
And Karen I think I think she's folder

1025
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,860
I'm so sorry about that

1026
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,860
It's just you know that whole Mary and Carla thing

1027
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,860
Just kind of flow so naturally Karen and Carla

1028
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,860
RumorGirls

1029
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:03,860
And I loved watching you guys at the podcast expo

1030
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,860
But I told you that I love when you were in the pool

1031
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,860
And you kind of flashed a little bit

1032
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,860
Hmm

1033
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,860
And Karen's kind of like the

1034
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,860
All-American girl

1035
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,860
When you look at her

1036
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,860
There was they just released another

1037
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,860
RumorGirls clip from PME

1038
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,860
Which was with their Callie Lewis

1039
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,860
And I look at that and I go like

1040
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,860
Oh man

1041
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,860

1042
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,860

You're gonna have to choose each other

And let them pass

00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,860
You know that's where you'll be

You know that's where you'll be

1066
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:31,860
You know that's where you'll be

1067
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,860
You know that's where you're going

1068
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,860
You know that's where you'll be

1069
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,860
You know that's where you'll be

1070
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,860
You know that's where you'll be

1071
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,860
You know that's where you'll be

1072
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,860
You know that's where you'll be

1073
00:38:48,860 --> 00:39:12,860
Yeah, what's up, Adam, it's Jersey Todd, the official musical, just the shot shot.

1074
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:17,180
Big thanks to Coli Brice from Area Records from the new intro high, you liked that.

1075
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:23,020
So listen, I want to take you a little opportunity to review the music that I provided in the last couple

1076
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,460
weeks, class couple of months up on the Daily Source code.

1077
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,380
We've given you some cowbell banging music, right?

1078
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,940
We've given you some rap music, right?

1079
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,940
We've given you some dance music, right?

1080
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,180
You know what I haven't given you?

1081
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:38,020
Some country music, and it's a little secret, Jersey Todd actually kind of sometimes likes country

1082
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,020
music.

1083
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,980
Yeah, it's got to be good, it's got to be the right stuff, and well, I think I got somebody for you.

1084
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,420
The artist is Kelly Brock out of Canada.

1085
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:49,100
I like her song a lot, the song is 30 something.

1086
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:53,500
Oh yeah, and I know what you're going to say, it doesn't hurt that she's cute because she

1087
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,500
really is.

1088
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,860
Check this out, I like the song a lot, talk to you later everybody.

1089
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:15,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

So much more to a scroll, simply f***ing good

1101
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,420
With the accomplished everything

1102
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:14,420
We said we were our sisters throughout history

1103
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,420
Yeah, they were healthy

1104
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:21,420
And sure enough soon enough to see a female president

1105
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,420
To be with you, look at us

1106
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,420
It's time to celebrate

1107
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,420
We are women of the world

1108
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,420
No, you're the free she gave

1109
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,420
We're the real world

1110
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,420
We're the real world

1111
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,420
We're the real world

1112
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,420
We're the real world

1113
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,420
We're the real world

1114
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,420
We're the real world

1115
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,420
We're the real world

1116
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:51,420
We're the real world

1117
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,420
Jersey Todd does it again

1118
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,420
The official music colleges of the Cha Cha

1119
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,420
Bringing you your

1120
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,420
Football selection

1121
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,420
Kelly Brock

1122
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,420
Thirty something

1123
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,420
Yeah, I do, you're right

1124
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,420
I'm looking at her page now

1125
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,420
On the podcast music network

1126
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,420
She is cute

1127
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,420
Kind of in that rough

1128
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,420
Like I'm gonna ride you cowboy

1129
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,420
Kind of way

1130
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,420
Mm-hmm

1131
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,420
Very nice

1132
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,420
You can find links to all of the songs played in the daily source code

1133
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,420
The daily source code dot com in the show notes

1134
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,420
Final thought in a second

1135
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,420
Ten lessons I've learned while surfing the internet

1136
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,420
Number one, entering your email address on some websites

1137
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,420
Is an open invitation to spam

1138
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,420
Number two, before forwarding an email about the ghost

1139
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,420
Of a dead boy appearing in the theatrical film

1140
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,420
Three men in a baby

1141
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,420
Check Snopes dot com first

1142
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,420
Number three

1143
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,420
Spyware that informs you that you have spyware

1144
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,420
Is not very helpful

1145
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,420
The FBI will never send you an email

1146
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,420
Warning about your visiting 40 illegal websites

1147
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,420
They'll simply bust down your door

1148
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,420
The file never ever Google the Toronto-based quartet

1149
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,420
The barricade ladies on a computer at work

1150
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,420
Number six, Bill Gates and Microsoft

1151
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,420
Are not tracking this email

1152
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,420
And forwarding it to 15 other people

1153
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:55,420
Will not get Walt Disney signed to send you free passes

1154
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,420
To Walt Disney World

1155
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,420
There's seven, there is no such thing

1156
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,420
As a national do not email

1157
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,420
Registry

1158
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,420
Number eight, there is no ousted prints

1159
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,420
In Bangladesh willing to share $15 million with you

1160
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,420
We're not closing one porn pop-up window

1161
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,420
Open's 15 more and number 10

1162
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,420
Everything as your service provider will solve most of these problems

1163
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:16,420
Unfortunately, the remaining few will take some common sense

1164
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:21,420
So I think a new thing I'll do here on the football

1165
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,420
Friday is a final thought of the week

1166
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,420
So I've been in London a lot over the past ten days

1167
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,420
Really, really with British people

1168
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,420
Besides the yanks who were in from San Francisco

1169
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,420
From HQ to help with London live

1170
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:39,420
They're really working with British production people

1171
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,420
Talent management people

1172
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:46,420
Artists, directors, you name it

1173
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:49,420
And I've really been paying attention

1174
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,420
Close attention to the language

1175
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,420
Now when I say to the language

1176
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,420
Normally you'd think about the accent

1177
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:58,420
And I think I've pretty much got the accent down

1178
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:01,420
I think I really can speak with the British accent

1179
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,420
Probably would be able to fool most brits

1180
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,420
I think I really do

1181
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,420
And I tried it yesterday and Daniel winner

1182
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,420
He's our managing director

1183
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,420
At Potcho UK

1184
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,420
I said let me give it a shot then

1185
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,420
And so I just spotted off a little bit with my English accent

1186
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,420
Which I'm not going to do if you're right now

1187
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,420
And he said well that's actually quite good

1188
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,420
But it does kind of sound like you're taking the piss out of us

1189
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,420
And I said well you speak American accent

1190
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,420
So he did an American accent

1191
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,420
It sounded really like he was taking the piss out of the American accent

1192
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:32,420
And so that gave me kind of a reference point

1193
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:34,420
And I think I figured it out

1194
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,420
It is not the accent that counts

1195
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,420
What is so beautiful about English spoken by the brits

1196
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,420
Is the use of the language

1197
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:44,420
Is the vocabulary that they bring into the conversation

1198
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,420
The structure of sentences

1199
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:49,420
The complexity of how they get to a point

1200
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,420
Which in some business negotiations or dealings

1201
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,420
It can be quite tedious

1202
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,420
And it's really just nice to pull out the yank in us

1203
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,420
And say okay here's what we want here's what you know

1204
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,420
Let's follow the money let's do whatever

1205
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,420
You know just the way the way Americans are much more direct

1206
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:08,420
But I am going to work a lot more on the vocabulary

1207
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,420
And grammar and structure

1208
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,420
And really the edge a lot of the adjectives are just beautiful

1209
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,420
That are used here in common language

1210
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:20,420
And I think that's the that is really

1211
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:25,420
We've resorted in the US to a language of slang really

1212
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,420
Which is okay because I like it too

1213
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:31,420
And believe me, believe me the brits love hearing the American accent

1214
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:34,420
They love it as much as we love hearing an English accent

1215
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,420
But down underneath all that and this is what I've learned this week

1216
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,420
Is just a

1217
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,420
I'd have to say almost a larger respect

1218
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:45,420
A greater respect for the language itself

1219
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:49,420
And for all of the beautiful ways you can use it to express yourself

1220
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,420
And to drive across a point

1221
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,420
So somewhere in there I'm hoping to find the magic mix

1222
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,420
Between the kind of the yank directness

1223
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:00,420
And the vocabulary and grammar and structure of the brits

1224
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,420
I'm reinventing myself

1225
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,420
It's a frightening thing

1226
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,420
Have yourself a great weekend

1227
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:07,420
I'll be traveling as you know actually tomorrow

1228
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:09,420
With Christina recording a new BG blast

1229
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,420
And a pod save the queen

1230
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,420
It'll be interesting if I can get her out of bed

1231
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:15,420
And actually doing it

1232
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:20,420
The most recent checks you received from pod show did motivate

1233
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,420
But if she doesn't want to do it, what can I say?

1234
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:26,420
I think she'll be there for recording time

1235
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:28,420
At the studio here at the cottage

1236
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,420
Sunday of course I'm traveling to San Francisco

1237
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:32,420
So I'll be all over the map also

1238
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,420
I think we're going to LA for a couple days as well as New York

1239
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:37,420
So I'm in miss a day here or there due to travel

1240
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,420
But pretty much it should be able to bring you

1241
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,420
I'll show you from the curry condo

1242
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,420
Looking forward to it haven't been there in almost eight weeks

1243
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,420
No almost ten weeks been so long

1244
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:48,420
Out of my pod show dot com to send me your love

1245
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,420

1246
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,420
Have a great weekend

1247
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,420
Thanks for listening

1248
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:54,420
Another pod show pod guest

1249
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,420
Stick it in your ear

1250
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,420
Get this pod cast

1251
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,420
And more great ones like it

1252
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,420
On the high performance pod cast

1253
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,420
We'll bring that work from pod show and lime light networks

1254
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,420
I love it
