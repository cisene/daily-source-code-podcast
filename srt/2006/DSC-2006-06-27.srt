I know for our job but listeners.

I need you for show.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I've got a mental picture.

We're on the show.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm on the show.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm on the show.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm on the show.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We need you for show.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We're gonna be with the police.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If we all work together.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm on the show.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We're on a small minority.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We're gonna make like misery for their neighbours.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And communities.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm on the show.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
These types of learning that the rules are changing.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We're on the show.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I kid, I only do autograph after the show.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Welcome to the show.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm in the next generation radio content in my ears.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We don't need non-sticky in prison.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm guessing it's a fellow curry.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I know this girl, she's a friend of mine.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I see her every day.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Time after time.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I wanna take her out.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
To dinner.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
After time, I wanna take her out

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
To dinner downtown

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But she only looks good from the neck

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
On taxi to night of the plane

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
She's nine times a day

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
She's nine times a day

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But the rest of her shows fine

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You should see that girl

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
She has stuff from the back she's great

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But from the front she's rough

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And when she turns around

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
My god would have died

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I only take her out in the middle

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Of the night course she's nine times a day

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
She's nine times a day

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
She's nine times a day

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But the rest of her shows fine

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
She's nine times a day

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
She's nine times a day

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
She's nine times a day

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
She's nine times a day

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
She's nine times a day

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
She's nine times a day

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
She's nine times a day

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
She's nine times a day

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
She's nine times a day

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
She's nine times a day

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
She's nine times a day

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
She's nine times a day

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
She's nine times a day

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
She's nine times a day

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
She's nine times a day

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
She's ten times a day

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
She's nine counts a day

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
She's nine times a day

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
She's nine times a day

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
She's ten times a day

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
She's ten times a day

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
she's fourteen times a day

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
She's ten times a day

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
She's ten times a day

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
She's ten times a day

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
She's ten times a day

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
She's ten times a day

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
She's ten times a day

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,200
I don't think she really looks good after nine of him

84
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Trace because she's not a cousin of her

85
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,200
She's not a cousin of her

86
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,400
She's not a cousin of her

87
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,200
But the rest of her choice is fine

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Only in America, the bot's at music network, the detonator's nine cans ugly

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I was a cousin through PMN this morning, I just could not resist

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Y'all's up

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
From New Jersey, of course, we're out

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Love it, love it, love it

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Although I must say, you know, I don't think there's one single woman in the world that I can't find some fantastic beauty in

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
There's no such thing as nine kinds of ugly, but that's song did crack me up, no doubt about it

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Everybody, how are you doing?

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Coming to you from the curry cottage in the affluent suburb of Surrey known as Gilford the United Kingdom

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's the Daily Source Code, I'm out of curry and here for the next foreseeable two weeks at least

98
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Before stuff starts to happen again, but good to be home

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Of course, got Christina with her with her knee

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah, they're hissing, I want to try something for a second, hold on

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How's that?

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You know, I think I'm gonna leave it like that, I think that sounds better

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah, so we have Christina with a knee she did go to school this morning, man

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's like she has a little mini knee growing out of her, out of her leg there, it's quite amazing

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'll tell you right up front, I'm a little bit, I'll just say, this combobulated today

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I had a long chat with my mom last night

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And those of you who have not been listening to the source code for a long time

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
My mom is suffering from lung cancer

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This has been ongoing for two years and it's quite an outrageous unfair disadvantage

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Fight that she's taken on here, or has been thrust upon her

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And yeah, it's the conversation I had with her yesterday

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's just so hard to hear someone, you know, she's going through an anger phase right now

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Which is totally understandable

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But it just it really throws you out of sorts, you know, because you're not quite sure how to respond

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And so anyway, so I just want you know that has influenced me a little bit today

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I woke up this morning still thinking about it, of course, as I do probably every morning

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But it's good to know not we're not alone in this and thank all of you for

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
For sending in your own personal stories and your thoughts and prayers, et cetera

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Now let's get back to porn and stuff like that

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Actually, today I believe is the vote in the house on the net neutrality bill

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And I've talked about this

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's really it's one of these very interesting phenomenon

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That is just coursing through the veins of the internet as it so happens

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And the memes are fantastic, you know, save the internet

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Which I think is probably the one you hear the most

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That big companies are going to take away the power from the little man

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That it's no longer will you be able to reach spots

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
There'll be, you know, it will only be mainstream media all of these things

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And I've really done a lot of investigation, a lot of reading, a lot of understanding

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Man, if you look at the actual telecom's bill

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And the main thing in the telecom's bill is I understand it is that it now allows

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Telephones companies to compete with the cable companies in the television access

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Which of course is all kind of subjective, what is television, you know

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Let's just they're calling a television which means something else I believe

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And we just call it video or programed or serialized video

136
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But that's the main part, the main crux of the of the bill

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And so this is a amendment that is that several groups are trying to get onto

138
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's interesting one of the groups is

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh, what is it?

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So it's saved the internet.org

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yeah, you see a whole bunch of companies that have signed up

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And that are for the petition over I think a million signatures

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Actually, which is quite well signature signups, which is very good

144
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's actually valuable by Silicon Valley terms

145
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
To have a community of a million people as worth some real money

146
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What's funny though is I maybe I misread it or didn't see it

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But I don't see Google or Yahoo or any of those companies signing up for this

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Nor do I see any of their own initiatives other than what they're doing at a high level political and high level political venues

149
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So anyway

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I disagree that

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That we need net neutrality or some kind of legislation for something that actually has not happened yet

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That to me is almost un-American in a way

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
To start putting laws into place on some positions of something that may happen in the future

154
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That we're not really completely sure of no one can say it with any certainty or accuracy

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So I have a fundamental issue with that

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But also I just don't believe it

157
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I think that the people who are most people don't understand how the internet works

158
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And it's not I'm not saying that I understand it

159
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I have been in the business of data centers and peering and internet exchanges and BGP

160
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Boardergate we protocol and peering and how all these things fit together

161
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And it's a very very complex matter

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And the internet is always kind of hung together and grown by commercial parties connecting

163
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And I've been around long enough to remember

164
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
When you can actually tell the difference when you had you know bad peerage or you were going through a horrible route

165
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
To your ISP wasn't connected to enough other or to sufficient backbone, etc

166
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And I don't even think that experts can clearly explain it

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's such incredibly geeky stuff

168
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But I truly believe that in open free markets and I think that it will

169
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That we will not have any issues and actually I want to talk a little bit more about it

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But I got some feedback. I got a ton of feedback actually

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
This one really hit the nail on the head on what I believe is happening with this

172
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That is zero for the area 51 group one more call

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The neutrality thing

174
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I just got that listening to your full explanation of it

175
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And you make it really hard to argue with you

176
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't want to argue with you

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
We're not arguing about the same thing

178
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Don't argue

179
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The high speed bandwidth is going to pay for it if you really want to

180
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
This is not what the argument is about

181
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That's all fine and good

182
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And anybody who is running fiber and boosting your network etc

183
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm talking about executives from major telecom companies saying

184
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Google is making a mint

185
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Because they are using our pipes and we want a piece of it

186
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's what everybody is talking about

187
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Fantastic

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You've nailed this piece of it right on the head

189
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Without trying to get into that whole cloud thing again

190
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Whenever you see a presentation about the internet

191
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And how wonderful things will work

192
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
There's always this cloud drawing in the middle

193
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Is the internet stupid

194
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And it just kind of works

195
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But there is a lot that happens there

196
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And you have to understand that if Google all of a sudden

197
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Let's take a pod show as an example

198
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That'll be much easier

199
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So maybe now we have in a month

200
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I don't know anywhere between eight and nine million downloads

201
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That will grow

202
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And as that number grows

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That traffic is being put on to different networks

204
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And big networks like AT&T

205
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Or SBC or whatever it is or Verizon or you name it

206
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Actually have to start upgrading their gear

207
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
In order to handle the traffic that we're sending through

208
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And which is kind of normal

209
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
We have to upgrade our gear because we've got a lot

210
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And we're connecting directly to their networks

211
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Remember that at a higher level

212
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
In fact we're seeing more and more of this

213
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That's how the podcast delivery network differs from many other systems

214
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Is we actually connect to directly to one of their machines

215
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Don't traverse over any other parts of the internet

216
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Of course that connection by itself

217
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Is an interconnection and therefore a part of the internet

218
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So we have to buy upgrade stuff

219
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Or our partner does in this case line-light networks

220
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And AT&T has to do the same thing

221
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Now what I believe AT&T is saying is

222
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Hey, you know what?

223
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We're going to leapfrog here

224
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
We're going to try and get up to par with Europe and with Asia

225
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Which is a very good idea

226
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Excuse me, since sail this sense sail moment

227
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Brought to you by the jersey touch show

228
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So you know it's critical because we want to you know

229
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
We're all used to these small little video clips

230
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Which is nice but you know is that the end of the road

231
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Or do we want to have better quality more capability

232
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Faster reaction times?

233
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Of course we do

234
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So I believe what SBC is saying

235
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Or the chairman said quite clearly

236
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Hey, if you're going to shove all this traffic on to us

237
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You know, there's going to be a charge

238
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And at no point that I hear him say if you don't pay

239
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
We're not going to pass anything through

240
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But yeah, there will be priority

241
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But you know there's priority in this priority

242
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
When you think priority you immediately think

243
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
A home man it's like waiting in the doctor's office

244
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I could be shoved to the back of the line

245
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Waiting for 45 minutes

246
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You know this is very this is milliseconds stuff

247
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Micro second stuff

248
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So don't get too freaked out about it

249
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But I think that's a good point

250
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That you know we just got more traffic

251
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
There are several main sources that are indeed

252
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Making money off of it

253
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And if there's you know

254
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
SBC rating doesn't want to pass all of their

255
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Costs onto their customers

256
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
We'll say indirectly we'll do over time

257
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So they're looking at the other side of the equation

258
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I really don't see anything wrong with that

259
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
If if you're Google size

260
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Then you will probably have to deal with that

261
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
If you're not then I don't think you're going to have any problem

262
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
This is not about shutting everything else off

263
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
This is about huge volumes of traffic

264
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Coming from single sources that have to be dealt with

265
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The technical manner and that dealing with it takes money

266
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
They're going to double charge Google

267
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
They're going to find other ways

268
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So it's not double charging

269
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
They're not charging Google

270
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
They're going to offer an extended service

271
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm quite sure of this

272
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm really not freaked out about the internet dying overnight

273
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Do this and they're going to hurt the internet in the process

274
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's what this whole thing is about

275
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I think it's gotten confused with this whole new plan to tear

276
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And people hear the two things they're talking about the same thing

277
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's not that you're at all

278
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
They don't come guys or look at a drive Google out of business

279
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
No, they're not trying to drive them out of business

280
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That would be ludicrous

281
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That would be stupid

282
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's like you know we're the drug dealer

283
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And we're going to remove the drug supply

284
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
No, no, no, no, that's not what they're trying to do

285
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
They're trying to recoup on their investment

286
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
For passing it through

287
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And Google you're wondering why they're building up dark fiber

288
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Well, that's because they're going to go directly to the consumer

289
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The competition is right there in front of your noses

290
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
All right, it's looking to hurt the customer

291
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
They don't like the internet at all

292
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I think that's what this whole thing is about

293
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
If there's nothing there, much to do about nothing

294
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Great, great, we can go on as we were

295
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But those of us who are kind of paranoid conspiracy theories

296
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Think the companies don't like little guys standing at hands

297
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And they'll hurt us when they can

298
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I think that's what this whole thing's about

299
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Thanks a lot

300
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
See you

301
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Okay, so what you said there is really what it's about

302
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But it's not really about big companies

303
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Not caring about little guys

304
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
That's bullshit, that's a customers

305
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
If anything, the big guys would like to convert their customers

306
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
into audience, they'd love to be television networks

307
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And I've dealt with the cable guys

308
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
They all think that their HBO

309
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
They're just trench diggers

310
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That's what we call them in the broadcast industry

311
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Sorry, if you're offended, but you know we say it

312
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
No, this is about something inherent in the end

313
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
By the way, this is only United States

314
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The internet, when people say the internet is going to die

315
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It could live without the United States

316
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Okay, there would still be a thriving internet

317
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And lots of people would be very happy

318
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yeah, we'd miss a lot

319
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But it's not the internet by itself

320
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Nor is SBC the only backbone provider, et cetera

321
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
There isn't inherent fear in the United States

322
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Of big companies screwing the little guy and not caring

323
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That's the fear, and I think that's crazy

324
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Since one of we've been afraid of big companies

325
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Shoot, American citizens have brought down big corporations

326
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Many times, for many reasons

327
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
We haven't quite had a revolution in government yet

328
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
We've brought down a government, but I think we would be quite capable of that

329
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And she guess what? We're also armed if we need to do it

330
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So this is, it's much more an issue of

331
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Ooh, it's the evil big company

332
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You know, and look at Google, Google was great until they became big

333
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And now they're evil

334
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You know, even when they said they don't want to do evil

335
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Or be evil, I can't remember exactly what the quote was

336
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So it's something else that's going on

337
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And we're really afraid of the big guy trying to kill us

338
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It does not be who of anyone to look

339
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
We're all hooked on this stuff

340
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
YouTube, Pod Show, Google, Yahoo

341
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You name it, we're hooked on this stuff

342
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And the telecom providers know it

343
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And what they're doing is they're saying we want to open up

344
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
A much bigger access pipe

345
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And yeah, we're going to talk to the dealers about it

346
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Because we're going to be able to add new capability

347
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It doesn't mean that you on the other side of the cloud

348
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Won't be able to be accessed

349
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Unless you become a really big drug dealer

350
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And then they're going to want to talk to you about new capabilities

351
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I just don't see this hole

352
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
We're not going to be able to connect to each other

353
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I just don't see it, I'm sorry

354
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Now when we're really in trouble here on issues of this magnitude

355
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Of course, as always, one person we can always

356
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Always look forward to hearing from

357
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's time for your tin foil hat

358
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And now it's time for another tin foil hat moment

359
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
From the financial aid podcast

360
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Hey Adam, it's Christian the financial aid podcast here

361
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
For everyone trying for legislation for network neutrality

362
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Stop it, stop it now

363
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Listen up, the last thing in the world you ever want to do in order to get something done

364
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
In a fair and equitable way is get the government involved

365
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Their ability to screw things up are legendary

366
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Let's take the most recent and net neutrality bill

367
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Which internet companies and private individuals have been pushing for

368
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
For starters, this turns over the regulatory power of internet service and content providers

369
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
To the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission

370
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
This is the same FCC that screamed bloody murder when Janet Jackson's breast

371
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Was unveiled on national TV and furthermore

372
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's the same FCC that is easily readily and routinely hijacked by a political conservative moment

373
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The parents television counsel

374
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Do you really want these right wing jobs in charge of your internet access

375
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
On top of that you can bet this so-called freedom legislation will introduce lots of new domestic spying capabilities

376
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
After all, a government will need to have unrestricted access to major data centers to ensure fairness

377
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Right, they wouldn't abuse that power for other means right

378
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The free market is and always has been the best mechanism for getting things done

379
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
The real solution to net neutrality is to vote with your two feet in your dollars as much as possible

380
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Do business with companies that follow your values as often as you can

381
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
But for God's sake, don't get the government involved

382
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
This is Chris from the Financial Aid Podcast

383
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Financial Aid Podcast.com

384
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Signing off another tinfoil hat moment

385
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Exactly, Chris

386
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm starting to feel like a republic

387
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
No, no, no, I totally believe in the free market in this case

388
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
There was something else I was going to say about that

389
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yeah, you know, so the arguments that I'm hearing are well, you know

390
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I just lost my train of thought again

391
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Oh, well, I was going to give you an analogy actually

392
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And then I'll just get off the top because I was going to give you an analogy as to a parallel

393
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
There we go

394
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
We have the US Postal Service and a delivers and it delivers pretty good

395
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Then we're all pretty happy with it. It's been that way for several hundred years

396
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But if we had put in postal neutrality, you know, would FedEx exist

397
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You know, are you allowed to have a service next to the postal service that delivers faster

398
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And has online tracking?

399
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yeah, of course

400
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Does it mean you can't send something the same size? Well, of course not

401
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Does it mean that there's a difference when you receive it?

402
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah, there is a difference

403
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
But this is what it's about, it's about advancement of the network

404
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
People who want to utilize that and in true business models

405
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I think it will all shake itself out. Let's just not get all crazy

406
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That the internet is dying

407
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
A lot of people pointed me at the Rocket Boom, Rocket Boom did it episode

408
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Trying to give an analogy of roads and Amanda driving in a car

409
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Very cute, but you know, Amanda's an actress

410
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
She doesn't really, I don't believe she understands what is happening

411
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
In the underpinnings of the internet

412
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And it's a very populist piece that I saw

413
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Interesting, though, that she was using a via notebook

414
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I wonder if that was, I never see commercials

415
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Or advertisements on Rocket Boom

416
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And I'm thinking that maybe that was an advertisement

417
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I really don't know, I thought that I really believe she was a Mac person

418
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But then I saw it with a Sony via

419
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
One just like mine, which I can't wait to talk about in a bit

420
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I don't know, it's David Cohen, I'm a UK listener

421
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm just picking up on the last week's source coast

422
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Catching up on them, all the one going to the car

423
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I just want to leave you some feedback about the net you chose you debate

424
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm all confused by your start

425
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
You know, you've been complaining about things like the

426
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Thanks for most credit card being denied

427
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And you say all the American credit cards

428
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm going to get out

429
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The IAA and Ask Cat BMI

430
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Not one thing card cards, let's see, promote their needs

431
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's free, but once it's a charge of extortion at fees

432
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I remember a couple of months about you complaining about

433
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And touch on, not be enough to send emails to people

434
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And you have to pay what you call the email tax

435
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
To get the email through

436
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Because that's what I've been paid for

437
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Isn't the net you chose to think exactly the same

438
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Isn't that just a price gouging by a comm to companies

439
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
They just want to take an extra price of the sharing

440
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And they've got to return their investment

441
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
With their investment and models can't return their investments

442
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
On what they're currently charging

443
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And then, you know, they shouldn't be in business

444
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And, you know, one day these guys are going to come to Port Show

445
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And they're going to say, hey, you're making extra money

446
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Or for a band or a band with vision

447
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
We want our extra money to show from you as well

448
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And asking the sector classes generally in Port Show particular

449
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So I'm just interested to know what your thoughts are

450
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And that would you think maybe you should take their site

451
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
This is something

452
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Anyway, I love the show

453
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I love the debate, I love the feedback lines

454
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And the photography

455
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Right on, yeah, right on dude

456
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Glad to hear you in the UK are interested as well

457
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Let them come

458
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You know, they can't extort us

459
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You know, that's the time to go to the government

460
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
If the telco start extorting us

461
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And now I remembered what I was going to say

462
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Early when I lost my train of thought

463
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You know, the true thing that has to happen here

464
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And maybe this is something that has to be a part of legislation

465
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's clearly when you need more choice of providers

466
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
If it's really going to be an issue

467
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So in that case we should

468
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Wow, it's my time already up for the satellite

469
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Window, correct?

470
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Yeah, I can't believe I've been yapping way too long

471
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Those of you checking us out on serious stars 102

472
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
This is the daily source code

473
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It's part of the pod show lineup

474
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Which you can hear every single week

475
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Day after noon from six to nine, six to ten

476
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Eastern time

477
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Calculate your own darn Pacific times

478
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Speaking of Pacific Pacific Coast, Hellway is next

479
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
With Mark Hirsch Motor Nemcoff and I'll see you later

480
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Tomorrow here on stars 102

481
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Okay

482
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Done with net neutrality

483
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I don't think it'll pass anyway

484
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I would be highly surprised

485
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Quick bit about football

486
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I spoke to you a taxi Eric yesterday

487
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
He's the guy that does all ground coordination

488
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And transportation for us

489
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And he's a cab driver

490
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But he does a lot

491
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Whenever we're in Holland

492
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Tomorrow I think we'll give him a call

493
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And ask him for an update

494
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
He's way into football as you can imagine

495
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I mean like way into it

496
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And he's a funny guy

497
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So he'll give us his predictions

498
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Et cetera on all the games

499
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Maybe we'll make it a regular feature

500
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And call him every day as long as there's an interesting game going on

501
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Hey Adam, this is Casey from Irving Texas

502
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And I call him one time listener

503
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Early just a podcast show

504
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
That I was able to find on my machine

505
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Was a 321 and a 2005

506
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
We're the way in on the C4 World Cup

507
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And I just express my opinion on why

508
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
There may be more than usual

509
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Viewership in the US

510
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I don't think it has to do really necessarily with

511
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Interest in soccer

512
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I think it's a lack of sports

513
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
We had at this time of year

514
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
He had two very small markets playing

515
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
In the NBA final

516
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
My hometown of Dallas and Miami

517
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
He had even small markets playing

518
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
In the NHL

519
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Stanley Cup

520
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Carolina, I'm not sure that's a city or a state

521
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
But Carolina and it's even small and marketing

522
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So I think the ESPN is kind of

523
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You know push the soccer thing on us this year

524
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
To preseason American football starts

525
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
The real football right

526
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It's Lisa's King down here in Texas

527
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And pretty much in the US

528
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
You mentioned that

529
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It's not a TV-friendly sport

530
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I feel like it's not much of a viewer-friendly sport

531
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Sometimes the camera angles are odd

532
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And I don't know

533
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
At least my opinion is

534
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
A little bit I've watched this year

535
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It appears to be 20 guys running around in circles

536
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Two guys kicking the ball back and forth each other

537
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It's actually a nice set of days

538
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
If you're trying to get the sleep

539
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
All right well thanks and I love the show

540
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
You know there's something much bigger going on with football

541
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And look at all these

542
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Look at the countries that are kicking ass

543
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Look at Ghana

544
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Look at the Ukraine

545
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
We saw a play yesterday

546
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
You know what's great about football

547
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And in this case I'm talking about association football

548
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Soccer

549
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Is that anyone can do it?

550
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
You don't need any equipment

551
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
You can do it with anything that kind of resembles a ball

552
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And anything that kind of resembles some goal posts

553
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And you can do it with eleven guys

554
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You can do it with three guys

555
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
With two guys

556
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You know it's you don't need much

557
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I guess the closest thing next

558
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It would be basketball

559
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
But you still need some special equipment for that

560
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And the countries where

561
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It's a way out

562
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
You know you can beat you

563
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
This is what

564
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Maradona and Paylay were all about

565
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Is you know local boy makes it huge on the world stage

566
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
And the world stage of course

567
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Includes a lot of other countries besides the United States

568
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And this has been going on for a while

569
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
In the US you kind of you play high school ball

570
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Then you go to the right college

571
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
There's a whole system that will bring you right through

572
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Into into the major leagues of whatever sport it is

573
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And with soccer you know

574
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You just play your ass off

575
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And anyone can really do it

576
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And that's you see the street fighter mentality of a lot of these countries

577
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And I think that is beautiful to see

578
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
About the television direction

579
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Yeah

580
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I'm not quite sure I should look into that

581
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Who's responsible for all the for the telecast

582
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
If it's all being done by German crews

583
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You know I think there could be a lot more

584
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
When I look at it on ABC is an example

585
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Man they're really adding a lot of graphics

586
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And they have the commentary

587
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And it's also an important part is who's calling the game

588
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
But it is much more than just about the ball

589
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You know it really is about you know

590
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Hey look at look at this kid he came from nothing

591
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
He's kicking ass he's representing our country

592
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's a whole pride thing

593
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Um

594
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Not unlike the European the Eurovision is so fast of all

595
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yo Adam it's Martin from

596
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Wevel squash center and there's been a strier actually

597
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
He'd love to listen to you so dude

598
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
It's a little bit bummed up to watching the strier

599
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Go to Italy last night after a referee

600
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
The lambda should have gone extra tall

601
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And then we would have won the penalty suit

602
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Anyway, I might love your show to keep it up

603
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And yeah

604
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Yeah

605
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
What a night

606
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
See you later

607
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Just messing around with my outline here

608
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Hold on a second

609
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Let me just get on this right

610
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Yeah

611
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Just messing around

612
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
If you got anything to say

613
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Give me a call on the voicemail numbers

614
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Number in New Jersey which is probably the best for your Skype out

615
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Two zero one six two five six three five seven

616
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
In London zero two zero seven six eight one three seven five three

617
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
The Earthlink ad challenge still rages on

618
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Um these things are not going through the judging process

619
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I got to get an update and I want to play a couple more new pieces for you

620
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Um

621
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Actually since I moved to the new laptop I had a lot you know a lot of my passwords

622
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I just in Firefox I just say remember

623
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And then of course I forget about them

624
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Well when that in the transition

625
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I was definitely afraid of using any migration tool

626
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
So I figured I just start all a fresh all you know all new

627
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And it's really not that much

628
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
But it is some stuff like your password file

629
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And yeah, I'm sure I could move it over and whatever

630
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
But I'm just kind of going through the motions again

631
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Um

632
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
So I can't actually get into the database

633
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And listen to any of the submissions as they come in

634
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
But podcasts are now getting into it

635
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Listen to Angie Beast chill cast

636
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
She did something with the Roger Smalls

637
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
You definitely have to check it at the end of her most recent episode

638
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And even our friends and it'll you're getting into it

639
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Think advertising sucks

640
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Think it gives always the same message again and again

641
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Listen to our revolutionary advertising for Earthlink

642
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Earthlink

643
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You will get late

644
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Frank, remember

645
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
With our clink they're going to put their mouth where your money is

646
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Let's Franco from Rockhouse, Detalia

647
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Dude you're outrageous

648
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
This of course goes right along with what I said

649
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
This is about advertising works

650
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Tell someone that they won't get laid or anything similar to that

651
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And they'll buy your product

652
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
It's the way it works

653
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
We should try that for the next presidential elections

654
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I'm telling you

655
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Vote for this guy

656
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Or you won't get laid

657
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Go to adchallens.podshow.com

658
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
To register your entry

659
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You can win pretty big prizes

660
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And actually we'll use your commercial

661
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Or your endorsement or your jingle

662
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Or your song or whatever

663
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
People are getting really creative

664
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So don't think it just has to be something you produce

665
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It can be just you know you talking about it

666
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
How should I? How should I? How does this work for daily source code listeners?

667
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You know, it's not and maybe it's only for the source code listeners

668
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
It may be the advertising shouldn't work across the board

669
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
We want you to tell us

670
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And Earthlink is hooking up with us for the ad challenge

671
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000

Yes, that can be an adventure in and of itself

682
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So you'll want to come over and check out

00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
With the song Adventures of a Death Dreamer

692
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Right on, what happened from a man goes through his own portal

693
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
We'll be journey inside my mind

694
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I do not hear anything

695
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Spent a little bit of time yesterday

696
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And second life of the pod show island

697
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Learning a tremendous amount about people

698
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
While doing this

699
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Learning about you know

700
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And once again, it's so interesting to see what happens

701
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Podcasters grouped together

702
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
They live together, they talk together, they promote their own shows

703
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
They totally, I'm really working on audience

704
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Please

705
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
You know this whole whole notion

706
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's like

707
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It's just

708
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I'm learning a lot about communities

709
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And

710
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Wow you know

711
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm so forgetting listeners involved in this

712
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And audience members

713
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And that's what I love about the voicemail feedback

714
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And a lot of the knowledge that I'm garnering

715
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Through just observing how people are in

716
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Oh, let's use the pod us here

717
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And actually how little we project outwards towards

718
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Just people who are listening

719
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
It's quite amazing

720
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It really is

721
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And so a lot of that knowledge is being poured straight into pod show

722
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Plus

723
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Hey, we're getting really close

724
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I can say I can safely say

725
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
What are we today the 27th

726
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Oh, did you hear that?

727
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Shoot

728
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
It's my, oh this is interesting

729
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
My mic cable, some

730
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Okay, I had a buzz there and now it's gone

731
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Good

732
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I think within a week

733
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I think I think we're that close

734
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Oh, man

735
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's going to be so incredibly cool

736
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
So on the pod show island

737
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It's a great place to just hang out

738
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Here's something I'm going to try

739
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I'm going to try a live daily source code

740
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Now it'll go out

741
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It'll be recorded as a pod cast

742
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
So it will be

743
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You know

744
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Available in the traditional manner

745
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
But I'm going to do it live for people who are

746
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
At the palace

747
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
So it'll be probably fairly music intensive

748
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
But I was thinking

749
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You know, we can also hook up

750
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
People through Skype

751
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I don't know, I just got this whole mind mel

752
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
That I'm working on

753
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I think it could really be a fun experiment for the show

754
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Which of course this is the show

755
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
To experiment with all kinds of shit

756
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Whether it's programming in the

757
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
In the programming of entertainment

758
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Sense or programming in the code sense

759
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Plenty of spots left over for vendors to come in

760
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Sell some crap on the on

761
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
So some podcast and crap if you want

762
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Or advertise your podcast

763
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I saw CC Chapman in there yesterday

764
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
He's rented a spot

765
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And we also have

766
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Oh man, learning so much

767
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
This is game called

768
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Slingo

769
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Which I guess is a form of

770
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Second life bingo

771
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Man, that's popular

772
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It's really how

773
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Rageously popular

774
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
You've got to check it out

775
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah, I'm just

776
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I'm thinking of the way we can do that as well

777
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Outside of second life

778
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
This is just

779
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's really interesting

780
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
At the end of the day

781
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
All the human elements come out

782
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
You know, all we really want to do is

783
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Just hang out

784
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Play games

785
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Watch people play games

786
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And good light

787
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Do you know what you want?

788
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Do you know why you want?

789
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Do you know who made you want it?

790
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Do you know what to do about it?

791
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I do

792
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Listen to partini

793
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Partini is a show about the people who make you want

794
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
The stuff you want

795
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And how they do it

796
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Go to partini.com

797
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Now go ahead

798
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Do you know you want to that

799
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Partini.com

800
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You can check out my podcast at the serieshow.com

801
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
That's HWBY

802
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Anyways, so

803
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I was sentenced here about

804
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Christina's

805
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Little miss hat that

806
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Steel day

807
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I'm going to call a field day

808
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
That's cool

809
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So

810
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I just want to give her my best wishes

811
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And give her a little story

812
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
That should

813
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Share her up

814
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I was running track

815
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm 15

816
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
To

817
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
So

818
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I was running track at school

819
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And

820
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
It was basically running the mile

821
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
For PE

822
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And it's 4th lap of

823
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Drinking around

824
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And

825
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Basically what happened is

826
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
My femur broke

827
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
My

828
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
A little bit of the bone

829
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
The thigh bone

830
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
The entire thigh bone

831
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Clean cut

832
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
It was in the hospital

833
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It felt stone

834
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
But I was on morphing

835
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Yes, not

836
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Not nitrous or accept

837
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Morphing

838
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And then

839
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
What the surgery and everything

840
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And I'm still going

841
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
This is it all

842
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
We had so

843
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I hope that Christina

844
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Feels better

845
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And I trust me

846
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I know we're slowing the slowing

847
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Sock

848
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Thanks

849
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Yeah

850
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
No kidding

851
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Thanks, dude

852
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Thanks for calling

853
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I'm sure she'll appreciate it

854
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
She wasn't quite up to doing a show last night

855
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And of course

856
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
We're getting so close to the

857
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Unleash of pod show

858
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Plus the podcast delivery network

859
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
The upgraded pod safe music network

860
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
It's been really busy

861
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So my my

862
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
My actual second life

863
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Which starts around 4 p.m.

864
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Which is 80m San Francisco time

865
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I was pretty busy

866
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
It's going to be busy again tonight

867
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
All the way up until midnight

868
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Just doing all the meetings

869
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Trying to fit in with the schedule

870
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
San Francisco

871
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Sometimes a little tough

872
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
On the

873
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
On the

874
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
The home life here

875
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
But

876
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Ah, these girls are so flexible

877
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
So anyway

878
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So we'll do a pod save the queen tonight

879
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
That'll go up and

880
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So you can be able to listen to that

881
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
By tomorrow

882
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
So an update on

883
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Am I via

884
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
On

885
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Imagine that

886
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Adam Curry

887
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Using windows

888
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Using a non apple product

889
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
It was this a comment that I got

890
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
That maybe want to talk about this with you

891
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Hey Adam this is David

892
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I'm son in California

893
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
That's tunes entertainment.com

894
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
My show is behind the wedding bay

895
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
The wedding mic

896
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And we talk about weddings and things going on

897
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
In the wedding industry

898
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And about this track

899
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
These are music

900
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And I love your show today

901
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I'm referencing the show

902
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
4-0-9

903
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
The copyright issue

904
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It's really cool

905
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I really like that

906
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
You talked about things going on

907
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
A little technical

908
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I'm a little bit of a technique

909
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
But I really like when you lean into it

910
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Not so much

911
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Well you take away all your other funds

912
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
That's like talking about the games

913
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And the soccer

914
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Where it came from

915
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And the porn stuff

916
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Now you could go with that

917
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
The text type

918
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
This time I pour a lip

919
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Of these things

920
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Did you imagine that you would bring chocolate

921
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
An apple again

922
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Fly high

923
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,080
F Billy

924
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,000
Bribe

925
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Your best friend

926
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
But one thing that I think is

927
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Boy

928
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Dr Kaitlin

929
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Clark

930
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I liked the

931
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
gypt

932
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,640
You know, but they haven't done anything about it, so I don't know what the future holds,

933
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,880
but I know Canada does have a license to where they can copy and use different formats

934
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,120
for their music and they pay one fee.

935
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,280
The U.S.A. has nothing like that.

936
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,280
That's not entirely true.

937
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,520
The establishment has to pay ASCAP BMI rights for a disjockey performing, but I appreciate

938
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,960
the fact that you like the geeky stuff, because I'm going to get just a little geeky

939
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,960
on your ass.

940
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:21,680
I can hear people around the net going, oh no, he's going geeky.

941
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,680
I'd love this via.

942
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,560
I got to tell you, you know what happens?

943
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:30,960
You use a piece of software or a gadget or something, maybe early on, and I guess what

944
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,320
you'd call an early adopter.

945
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,960
And you use this very early on and you see all the shortcomings and usually it eventually

946
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:44,040
winds up propping up a table somewhere or discarded or sent off or given away or whatever.

947
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,320
That experience sticks with you for a long, long time.

948
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:52,640
My whole experience with Windows, and particularly the hardware part, I know what Windows

949
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,680
is the operating system does, but there's no tight integration between the Windows operating

950
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,680
system.

951
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:03,160
Microsoft doesn't make PCs, so they don't really have a lock on, okay, this is how we're

952
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,160
going to do it.

953
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,120
It makes it much tighter, much easier, which is exactly what Apple does.

954
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,840
But they have fixed a lot of things.

955
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,440
I have to say, you know, I plugged in on my wireless keyboard stuff, it worked immediately.

956
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:24,920
I can plug in cards, SD memory cards, a lot of the drivers, this UNP and P, or universal

957
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,840
plug and play, it does kind of work.

958
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:34,800
This via laptop has a camera built in and guess what, it kind of works.

959
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,280
Stuff that I never could get to work on the Mac or with a lot of issues, unless I'm

960
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:45,640
using their dedicated software, and you know, I got to say, I'm just, it's not bothering

961
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,640
me that much.

962
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,640
At all, in fact, I'm really enjoying the speed of it, it is definitely the fastest computer

963
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,640
I've ever had.

964
00:42:52,640 --> 00:43:00,280
Now, I think this has a dual core processor, so it's, it's hot shit that's going on inside.

965
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,040
Yeah, there's, you know, you have to kind of figure it out, each manufacturer puts different

966
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,680
things in, and it has different widgets and software, and you know, they're all pretty

967
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,680
much related.

968
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,160
It's the stuff that, you know, does not come in Windows that pertains particularly to the

969
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,200
hardware, so you have to kind of figure it out, and I think Sony does a pretty good job.

970
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:23,040
You know, I'm able to mix and match my monitors, a docking station, when I undock, you

971
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,960
know, it used to be, you'd undock, and you'd basically have to reboot Windows, don't have

972
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,960
to do that anymore.

973
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:37,040
So it really has come into its own, I have to say, yeah, it's, it's not bad, I can't

974
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,720
tell you any, any different, you know, and there's little applications for all the things

975
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,680
that I was doing on the Mac, and yeah, you have to learn different key commands, and it's

976
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,680
nice about it, you can customize it, you can do a lot of customization.

977
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,960
My Sony Vio looks very much like a Mac, it's got the Mac background, the icons, I have

978
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:02,880
a dock, I've got, I've got an Apple menu, which I never really use that much on the, on

979
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,880
the Mac either.

980
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,120
I have a control H command now for hide, and there's a few things that you have to kind

981
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:13,120
of learn, but it's just, it's not that bad, I'm sorry, I just can't hate it.

982
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:18,360
Hey Adam, it's Carl here, I swear tonight, if you, if you're considering actually

983
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:24,640
going back to the Macs, when the new things just come out, or if you'll be thinking

984
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,240
about going for Windowsista, thanks, bye.

985
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:33,400
Well, so there's two things you asked there, one is about hardware, and the other is

986
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:38,800
about new software, I don't really care about Windows Vista, I have no idea what it would

987
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,000
do, you know, what, you know, I'm sure it has all kinds of technological things, oh, by

988
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,040
the way, for those of you who were using something like QuickSilver or Spotlight, I installed

989
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,560
Google Desktop, and I really like it, because you just hit the control key twice, and it pops

990
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:58,360
up right in the middle of your screen, a little search bar, and you type in your search

991
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,360
request.

992
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,000
Now if you're looking for an application, you can set it so that it brings up the application

993
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,440
and documents first that are on your, on your machine, so if I want to start cast blast,

994
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:11,840
so I just hit the control key quite twice, and then CA, and it comes up cast blast, or

995
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:16,040
when I hit go, and cast blast, or launches, you know, that's the type of speed stuff that

996
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:21,760
I really had figured out on the Mac, and I'm figuring it out on Windows, and, and I know

997
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,360
this hardware is going to hang together, you know, the Sony has a great QA process, and

998
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:32,320
they do make great consumer products, they've been at a huge disadvantage, it's not

999
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:37,680
pretty, it's nice, I like the keyboard, especially, really big keys, it feels very nice.

1000
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:43,920
I have to stretch a little bit more than I was used to on the Toshiba, but it's not

1001
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:50,160
as beautiful, I mean, they should hire a couple of real designers, and it would be even

1002
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:57,640
better, the screen is phenomenal on this thing, you know, it's got, it has a edge network,

1003
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:04,920
networking, if I want it, and it's got all the ports, it's got everything you need, and

1004
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,880
with the Mac, you know, I've been following along with the new MacBook Pros, and I'm

1005
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,440
now I'm seeing it from a little bit of a distance, and I'm seeing people going through

1006
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:26,120
the Wi-Fi not working, the overheating, Joey Eto has been writing on his web log about how

1007
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:30,840
we can't use it on an airplane, because it draws so much power, it keeps popping, fuse,

1008
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:37,080
breakers, circuit breakers in the plane, so you then have to turn it off, and then it has to

1009
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,760
charge, and then it's just, you know, all kinds of nightmares, I think they're on their fourth

1010
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:48,120
series of of power books by now, and I'm just seeing the people saying, oh, okay, you know,

1011
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:54,120
I'll go for the next one, or wait for the next one, or I'll get it upgraded, and, you know,

1012
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:59,960
it can't just be beautiful, and yeah, the operating system is I love Unix, I grew up on Unix,

1013
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:05,800
but I just don't use the command line that more anymore, you know, I just don't need to create

1014
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:12,200
little quick applications, and pipe stuff out from one process to another, and if I needed to,

1015
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:16,680
well, you know, I could probably find an application that does what I want to do, because

1016
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:23,800
you know, Windows does have a lot more people developing for it, so I don't know if I'll

1017
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:28,600
go back, I mean, I like the mix, you know, I still have a Mac here in the office, a Mac downstairs,

1018
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:33,000
but for my real productivity machine, the one that I live on, my window to the world,

1019
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:40,920
I got to tell you, so far, so good for the Sony Vio. Hey Charlie fans, Brian here from

1020
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:48,360
Procrasticast. I think I just found a great way to get high, turning on a musician to the

1021
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:54,840
pod safe music network. So the other day, Jeremy Row, a musician who lives way up here in Michigan's

1022
00:47:54,920 --> 00:48:00,280
upper peninsula where I do, stops over at the house, well, the Procrasticast studios.

1023
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:06,280
And we did a show together, which you can find over at audioaditude.com if you're so inclined.

1024
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,680
Anyway, guess what? After that, he decided to upload one of his songs to the PMN.

1025
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:18,360
Is that cool or what? The song, in line to die, it's about a good friend of Jeremy's facing

1026
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:24,520
redeployment to a rack. Now on the pod safe music network, as if that's not cool enough,

1027
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,760
Hey Jeremy, put this in your bowl and enjoy the buzz. A debut on the daily source code.

1028
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,320
Kick an ass. Jeremy Row, within line to die.

1029
00:48:54,840 --> 00:49:03,480
There's a cold window, no way for combat. There's time, I am shaking.

1030
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,760
We have a familiar feeling.

1031
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:54,840
Jeremy Row, within line to die, it's about a good friend of Jeremy Row,

1032
00:49:54,840 --> 00:50:10,920
and we have a good friend of Jeremy Row, and we have a good friend of Jeremy Row and we have a good friend of Jeremy Row

1034
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:43,080

1035
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:59,160

1037
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:45,240

and we have a good friend of Jeremy Row, in line to die, the pot say from music network,

1040
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:38,240
I know that this show gets downloaded in portions of Iraq and Afghanistan by members of the coalition.

1041
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,480
We're thinking of you guys and gals as well.

1042
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,480
All right, that's it for the show for today.

1043
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,480
I'll be back tomorrow, same, I'm just gonna say, same time.

1044
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,480
That depends on you, doesn't it?

1045
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,480
So yeah, I guess it will be the same time.

1046
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,480
Same time.

1047
