00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,780
You need to love right there on the microphone.

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,780
So here she is, yes, the lady Patricia.

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,780
The say to have some better than one.

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,780
And with this angel from above,

21
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,780

It's Adam and Patricia.

26
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,780
Yes, Adam and Patricia.

27
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,780
Adam and the lady Patricia.

28
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,780
I'm a paranoid schizophrenic with surround sound speakers.

29
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,780
They're everywhere, they're everywhere.

30
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,780
I'm a cell phone to a megaphone to my headphone

31
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,780
And I'm still alone.

32
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,780
They're everywhere, they're everywhere.

33
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,780
And I like to talk to you right now,

34
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,780
But it's me on the other mind.

35
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,780
I'll call you back when we're the man

36
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,780
I'm the use gives me the sign.

37
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,780
And I know you think they're all acting

38
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,780
To get you for the really antagonist.

39
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,780
Can't you see?

40
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,780
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere.

41
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:32,780
Everywhere, everywhere.

42
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,780
Everywhere, everywhere.

43
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:43,780
I'm a militant environmentalist in four exploders

44
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,780
And I'm a true man, and I'm a true man, and I'm a true man

45
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,780
I'm a xenophobic, tapioca foam, and I'm a plump, full bacon course foam

46
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,780
And I'm a true man, and I'm a true man, and I'm a true man

47
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,780
And I like to talk to you right now, but it's me, I'm alone mine

48
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,780
And call you back when the spaceship lands in 1949

49
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:15,780
And I know you think they're all out to get you, but they're really out to get me

50
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,780
Can't you see?

51
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,780
They're everywhere, they're everywhere, they're everywhere

52
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,780
They're everywhere, they're everywhere, they're everywhere

53
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:35,780
They're everywhere, they're everywhere, they're everywhere

54
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,780
They're everywhere, they're everywhere

55
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,780
I'm a fighter, I'm the boy, except he sent me in

56
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,780
Who's always meeting

57
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,780
And I'm a true man, and I'm a true man, and I'm a true man

58
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,780
And I'm a true man, and I'm a true man, and I'm a true man

59
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,780
And I'm a true man, and I'm a true man

60
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,780
And I like to talk to you right now, but it's time for me

61
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,780
Call your back, my head's cut out, but of course that'll be too late

62
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,780
And I know you think they're all out to get you, but they're really out to get me

63
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:35,780
Maybe every way, they're everywhere, they're everywhere

64
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,780
They're everywhere, they're everywhere, they're everywhere

65
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,780
They're everywhere, they're everywhere, they're everywhere

66
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,780
They're everywhere, they're everywhere, they're everywhere

67
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,900
They're everywhere

68
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,640
They're everywhere

69
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,640
They're everywhere

70
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,340
Ah nice little mini

71
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,380
They're everywhere

72
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,460
Another mayonnaise

73
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,500
Strikes

74
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,040
Jim's Big Ego from the pod save music network

75
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,360
From Massachusetts in the United States

76
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,800
Why did you find Disney?

77
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,360
I found it at the pod save music network

78
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,940
Wow

79
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:24,940
Jim's Big Ego compares itself to such major players as the Great Wall of China, the Grand Canyon, Antarctica, and other things you can see from space.

80
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,940
Okay, I don't know where they give the name from.

81
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,940
Very good.

82
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:36,940
It is that the Daily Source Code episode 451 coming to you from the affluent suburb of Suri known as Gilford in the United Kingdom,

83
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,940
at the Curry Cottage with the Lady Patricia.

84
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,940
Hello, how are you?

85
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,940
Hello, darling.

86
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,940
Good to see you on the show.

87
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,940
Well, I saw you this morning.

88
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,940
Yeah, I know, but on the show.

89
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,940
Uh, good to see you on the show.

90
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,940
Um, because we got some stuff to talk about.

91
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,940
Yeah.

92
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,940
You don't have your tooth in.

93
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,940
It's not tooth.

94
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,940
There.

95
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,940
My molar.

96
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,940
I know when you get your new ones.

97
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,940
Are they done yet?

98
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,940
Has it been six months yet?

99
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,940
Almost almost almost there.

100
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,940
It is painful.

101
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,940
This whole process.

102
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,940
Yes, it is.

103
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,940
It takes so long.

104
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,940
That's why you don't see Hollywood celebrities from months on end because they're sitting in

105
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,940
Alabama on the beach where they're where their face all chopped up.

106
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,940
I know, I know.

107
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,940
They're teeth at least.

108
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,940
But it's necessary because teeth are so important for your general, for your general health.

109
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,940
Exactly.

110
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,940
For the inside of the outside.

111
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,940
Yes.

112
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,940
Um, got a couple things to talk about.

113
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,940
Then I want to talk about the sweet 16 party.

114
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,940
Well, start about this morning.

115
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,940
This morning.

116
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,940
I told you I'm going to tell them.

117
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:41,940
I wanted to wake you up with some lovely angel kisses on your.

118
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,940
Inormous.

119
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,940
Menhood.

120
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,940
Uh-huh.

121
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,940
Really?

122
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,940
Yes.

123
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,940
I wanted to wake you up.

124
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,940
Well, you know, I had just that urge.

125
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,940
Why didn't you?

126
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,940
Because you weren't deep sleep.

127
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,940
Yeah.

128
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,940
Well, that would be what I do when I sleep.

129
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,940
Yeah.

130
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,940
You weren't deep sleep.

131
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,940
In coma.

132
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,940
And I could see that it was not a good time.

133
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,940
And after that, when I, you know, just cut a little bit with you.

134
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,940
You know, I hated in the morning.

135
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,940
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

136
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,940
Not anymore.

137
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,940
Fuckers.

138
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,940
Yes.

139
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,940
But that was only after you told me what you had let that's only what you had told.

140
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,940
So unfair.

141
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,940
So this is after you told me what you didn't do.

142
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,940
So how fair was that?

143
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,940
Yeah.

144
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,940
Because I can.

145
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,940
Maybe you should try the angel kisses and see,

146
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,940
Do you think that I would respond incorrectly?

147
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:44,300
I do that now and then, but yeah, it's for you it's I know and you come out of a coma

148
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:51,220
Okay, all right, let's just hold on a second back up because this is I'm gonna get a really bad reputation from all this shit

149
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:57,860
You think so? Yes, there are lovely men who would love to excuse me. There was no offer

150
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,540
There was no offer there was no initiation. There was an all I'm hearing about is what you didn't do

151
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,100
But what you thought about that does not count

152
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,700
But I do it now and then and and do I ever say go away?

153
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,700
No

154
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:18,300
No, well you announced the this morning. I am not a morning fucker right, but you know

155
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,700
I'm not you've known this for 20 years and I'll tell you exactly why because when my eyes open up

156
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,700
Yeah, first I think oh

157
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:30,380
I'm glad I'm glad the open my split. No, no, I think I'm glad the Patricia

158
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,740
I'm glad that my eyes open because I've learned that from you. I'm like oh, that's another day

159
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,540
What day Tuesday? Hmm. What do I have to do and then within five seconds of waking up?

160
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,100
I'm already thinking about the show

161
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,220
I'm thinking about appointments. I have I can't help it so that that's not a very sexy mood

162
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,620
It's different but that's after I'm awake

163
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,060
So you're your prime opportunity

164
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,980
No, you take longer to wake up. It's your prime. I know, but your prime opportunity is before I wake up

165
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,620
So there's nothing wrong with that. I have to do it when you sleep. I'll tell you what. Why don't we try it again tomorrow?

166
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,420
Well, you're

167
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:08,900
And let's see what happens. Okay, show is that a deal? Yeah, okay, all right

168
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:15,780
We've got people have been calling in over the past week at plus one two zero one six two five six three five seven

169
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,740
Which most people now seem to have in their cell phone because I'm getting a lot of but but calls

170
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,460
You know people sit on their cell phone and then it calls them home

171
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,340
Really a lot of those but but phones. Yeah, you've got phone B. Yeah

172
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,780
I heard you a couple of times. You heard my butt phone. Yeah. Yeah. Was it any good?

173
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,900
You were going on about flying

174
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,020
Captain Dan boring

175
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,500
Mental

176
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
So I thought after what

177
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,780
It's not you were actually listening to see if you could hear any fine and then he's like well how boring is that boring

178
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:52,500
He's not doing anything exciting legal. I can't trap him doing anything

179
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:57,300
You're horrible. See what he said you're horrible. I'm gonna take your key lock off

180
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,300
So I can get some from you too

181
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,780
Yeah, I have a key lock. That's right. All right. Here's the here's one call. It's what can I add

182
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,820
I'm very soon again

183
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,660
I am here in a really cool one all the day. I was just reading the paper

184
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,660
Okay, this is what I know because I had to listen to it four times

185
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,660
He's saying oh, I don't miss it. I was on holiday reading the paper

186
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,460
Okay, okay

187
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,380
What the week I think whether it's an image in that video six

188
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,100
So they're finally reporting on the video sex

189
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,580
Yes, they finally got it

190
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,580
Find things out before

191
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,580
Before the people say it's true

192
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,580
You know people find things out before other people

193
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,820
Yeah, especially before a journalist to do you know

194
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,860
And they're the one who who have to do the research

195
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,700
Just remember you ever do you heard it here first I know on the daily source

196
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,220
Finish this comment you won't get said what people find in the big news

197
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,220
I'm down already

198
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,220
I have no

199
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,220
Yeah

200
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,220
He's a he's a Bruton holiday. Yeah, yeah

201
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,500
I'm gonna wrap up this whole Carmen Tyler naked picture thing we talked about it last time

202
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,460
I know I'm done with it. I'm done being people keep sending in stuff

203
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,020
So just a couple things I want to say the first thing actually

204
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,220
Remember I told you about that press release that we put out about this seven hottest women in podcast thing

205
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,940
and then it was just like

206
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,700
People were saying you know you're using sex to sell podcasts and it's and this is wrong and it's like

207
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,620
What is going on and then I received this call

208
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,540
Hey Adam it's Karen from RumorGirls.com

209
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:49,140
I wanted to thank you and Pod Show for the recent press release that stated Pod Show becomes home of the seven hottest women in podcasting

210
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,780
I knew Pod Show wasn't talking about our looks even though we are all quite sexy

211
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,340
Because if you were talking about our looks

212
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,180
Would you have wanted to add Madgy Weinstein to the list? Thanks Adam

213
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,780
Yeah, exactly exactly

214
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,060
We want to see her naked. Oh, I don't think so

215
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,180
I don't think so. Hey Adam it's Carmen Tyler. She is

216
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,460
See that I'm kind of this topic of conversation on the daily source code

217
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:23,860
Which is kind of funny, but I kind of feel like I need to respond to your requests for nude photos of me

218
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,340
Well, the answer is pretty much

219
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,620
No

220
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,340
The most you'll get for me is like as to I'm super sure from when I competed or

221
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:42,100
Or maybe a photoshoot that I did or possibly like the sheer pageant gowns or a gown that I have that kind of gives the illusion

222
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,260
But I'm not really nude

223
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,940
So I'm sorry about that, but you know, I still love you, man. You're so awesome and I hope you have a great day

224
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,340
And I'll talk to you later and one more thing

225
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,580
Just to let you know Adam

226
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,780
I'm a folder

227
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,980
Okay, that helps

228
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,780
Oh

229
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,580
I feel better

230
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,980
But you know she sounds so sexy

231
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,780
I know exactly this is my entire point

232
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:09,540
Yeah, and I have to say that she doesn't need to be afraid. I've been naked a couple of times

233
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,180
It never hurts me never or my career or career or anything

234
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,180
I mean nothing just I got a lot of money for it

235
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:23,620
And don't don't give her any ideas. I don't want to pay for the naked picture. It's a kick

236
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,020
Such a kick

237
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,820
But I'm really not disappointed. Do you want to you and I might pick your honey?

238
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,020
I have a couple of yours

239
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,660
Okay

240
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:35,700
I'd still carry someone in my wallet some naked pictures. We're on the road. That's good. I love to be naked

241
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,020
I don't know what the problem is in America. You know being naked naked is a lot wonderful

242
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:48,100
I agree more naked feel free. It's a freedom. Let's ask the the neighbor with the with the big houters and the red sports card

243
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,100
That's asked her to be naked over here. She probably will

244
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,140
She waived at me the other day

245
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,140
Yeah, but she's the neighbor

246
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,580
She was like, hi, how are you doing? Hello

247
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,580
But I'm not too bad and not too sad about the lack of pictures from Carmen. Yeah

248
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:12,020
I'm a little confused as to why some of your Christian listeners are upset with naked bodies

249
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,980
If you read the first book in the Bible, God actually gets very angry with someone called Adam

250
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,580
So can I pull and then covered himself up with a loincloth

251
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:26,180
So I think if you want to avoid God's wrath, then get down so I'll spam drop your pants and give me a power book

252
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,860
Just listen it to send to naked photos and I found one of mine taking three years ago

253
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,860
So I've seen that in later four years

254
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,980
I'm the one on the left who smudged against the window

255
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,900
The one on the planet holds in the trophy that's my uncle

256
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,780
I just wanted to help you get the ball rolling and so I think if you look closely enough of the focus

257
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,900
So you'll see that's what my uncle's doing too, right now

258
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,660
I'm not gonna show you this picture. Oh, you got it. No, it will freak you out

259
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,140
I'm not gonna show it to you and it's really him

260
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,700
Well, I guess

261
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,540
Is that much to see, there's not much to see. No, I'm curious

262
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,580
Good to hear from you, Roger. Thanks. Appreciate it

263
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,860
Okay, this is gonna take us into the sweet 16 party

264
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:29,060
Yeah, yeah, I'm George's discussion of your story about your daughter Christina's 16-year-old birthday party

265
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:37,700
I start listening to you show away back one way you're playing with your eye river and and fighting with Christina to get out the door one morning

266
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,860
That's the same morning. I was listening to your show and that was when you were in Rotterdam

267
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,780
And then I had to get it to school on time. Yeah, so I recorded the whole thing

268
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:53,780
Lot of parents identified with that. Oh, yeah, at the same type of discussions with my teenage daughter getting out the door that morning

269
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:58,500
We just kind of laughed that you were having the same discussions. We were we just had that morning

270
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,660
So it's like that he's short ever since that and let me tell you that's so nice to hear that to know that we're not the only ones

271
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,660
I think parents really love it

272
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,180
I enjoy hearing that parents have the same issues with their teenagers

273
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,940
I'll always compare our stories with the Erika the taxi driver

274
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:14,980
Amsterdam

275
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,420
We do have a couple of daughters and and the same same story

276
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,420
Judging that you know I've got two teenage daughters and it seems like

277
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,060
a team to this

278
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,060
right now team seem to have these

279
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,980
These are ways to communicate. I am a voice mail

280
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,940
I said

281
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:38,980
So phones and all that they just seem to be more accomplished and in developing relationships

282
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:44,020
They're a little less inhibited also because of that so maybe they don't eat drugs

283
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,060
It alcohol so much to lose their inefficient so I

284
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,980
I just think my daughter seems to be you know still your responsible teenager

285
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,780
But they seem to have a better head out of their shoulders than we did

286
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,780
Yeah, I agree

287
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:00,740
Appreciate yourself. Thanks. Bye. I'll just support it. Bye. Yeah, I agree with that. Yeah, yeah

288
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,220
I would like to compare it to the 16-year-olds in my time

289
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,100
I was a fucking schmuck. Yeah, I was pretty worldly because I was doing part of radio and stuff in Amsterdam

290
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,700
I'd go there and you'll hang out with a lot of interesting people until deep in the United

291
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,500
Playing smart you weren't it

292
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,260
By 16. I was getting that's what I'm so worried about. Yeah, I think well

293
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,820
I did know a lot of shit when I was 16 and I'm sure Christina is very wise to a lot of

294
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,820
So much what is this?

295
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,220
I don't know if it's good. I don't know so we had her sweet 16

296
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,860
Her birthday party Sunday, which was good because it was a bank holiday on Monday

297
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,220
Yeah, yeah, and the UK which means everyone has the as the day off

298
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,620
Everything is closed shops are closed the whole thing is show the whole country shut down

299
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:54,980
And she invited like 50 or 60 kids a thing. Did you have 50 friends when you were 16? I didn't she has over a thousand friends on my space

300
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,780
You know, and I have to say because I was very nervous the day

301
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:07,940
Well, but that's related to your childhood. Yeah, yeah, I know you have a childhood trauma where you had a birthday party

302
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:14,820
Yeah, and all the girls said let's not go. Yeah, and then no one came one bully and you were sitting there with with your

303
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,900
meeting with my next

304
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,500
You understand that this is all about you as nothing to do with no I know, but it's your trauma

305
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:29,380
It's in there and she said I'm gonna I'm gonna be between 15 and 60 friends and I thought oh my god

306
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,900
I hope they're coming

307
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:37,700
She was so nervous. I was so nervous the whole day and she was getting dressed up and she looked lovely

308
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:43,300
Yeah, it was an alicine one in length until I I couldn't believe when you know the ear showed up

309
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,180
A couple of girls had big long and

310
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,140
Bunny's most of the girls looked incredibly hot. It was

311
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,980
It was horrible

312
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:55,060
Because you know you I found myself like looking at these girls and like oh my god. Oh my god

313
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,220
No, no, yeah

314
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,140
You told me you said oh my god

315
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,580
They're so sexy, but I shouldn't actually it's it's bad and wrong. I know

316
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:11,060
You can't deny beauty you can't deny sex appeal. Yeah, and but it was not I know what you mean

317
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,940
I saw it too. So we rented a room at the stoke

318
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:19,540
Yeah, she's a pop-up very very difficult to arrange this doesn't happen often at all in fact

319
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,540
I'm what I'm not in great Britain

320
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,180
Yeah, you cannot get you cannot rent a place that'll have teenagers that just don't want to deal with them

321
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,860
And of course Christina saw it on TV MTV the the 16

322
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,940
My super sweet 16. Yeah, she's like daddy. I want M&M

323
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,740
Yeah, right and

324
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:41,780
I said yeah, they're not used to that for example. It is a lot of money for a lot of parents

325
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,300
You know to give a party like that and let that's one thing

326
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:50,900
60 people will have a drink and and it's next this is that this is the real core of the problem is the drink

327
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,580
Because when you're when you're 18 you're legal the drink

328
00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:00,820
When most kids are already drinking when they're 15 at least they want to drink well they are drinking because you can get it

329
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,780
And so what was interesting about this so we did not serve alcohol. We did have

330
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:13,140
A free bar. We had food. We had balloons. We did the DJ no alcohol. So while the kids, you know

331
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,500
Went out and had a drink around the corner went to the other end of the show there

332
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,820
Anyway, so what then it's not our problem and and they won't get a problem

333
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:27,140
But I was amazed because everyone had really good time despite the lack of alcohol and they were like 70 kids there

334
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,380
It was outrageous and they and they and they went and you know only a couple crashes

335
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,620
And you know we got rid of them pretty quickly. That was no big deal

336
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:39,540
No one was fighting no one was puking and it was yeah. It was really enjoyable

337
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:46,340
They had a great time and I have to say good kids. I love those kids. You know, I mean sweet kids. It's interesting

338
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:51,860
You know, they do act grown up which is just no new for us in general to have these punks

339
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:57,460
You know and these kids like pants fallen off their ass, you know tattoos up and down their arms

340
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,380
Yeah, harm is to Mrs. Curry. We could talk to you having week apart

341
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,260
It's a weekend

342
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,060
What was it? Who was it this had them yeah I'm having

343
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,100
What was it Liam? Yeah, so one of the because we had you know

344
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,300
I won't say bounceers, but we had you know people who could

345
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:21,860
Throw you out if we had to yeah and and so I think it was Liam who had trouble getting in

346
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,900
You said well, you know they thought it was just some some kind of outside

347
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,860
And I said well, dude, how about the tattoos and the piercings that'll probably you know make it a little more difficult in life

348
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:35,380
You know be prepared for more of this yeah, then of course Liam is our daughter's new girl a boyfriend

349
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,940
Yes, how wonderful. Yes

350
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:46,900
Yes, 21 fantastic. I'm just totally loving that yeah, yeah, and I just said she's asking me over and over

351
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:52,340
She wants an approvals. She says do you like him mom? Do you think he's nice and I say

352
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
See she doesn't want to hear the truth

353
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:02,820
Yeah, I don't dislike I have a theory about it by the way. I have a theory. I think he's a little bit too

354
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:09,220
He's old too old too old too old. He's too old. Now 21 he's too old. Yeah, but I don't trust him

355
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:14,580
Yeah, I'll tell you why I have a theory about this. What so he he walked her home yesterday

356
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,460
Last night, right and from wherever they were in the in town he walked her home and then

357
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:25,940
State for a couple minutes and he left but before that he came up here and this is the kind of guy that he's he's a slime ball

358
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,260
Yeah, yeah, that's nice

359
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:34,500
Well, we already said that at the party when he came to us. Hi, Mr. Mrs. Curry nice to hear slime ball lovely there and he walked away

360
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:40,340
We said slime ball. Yeah, you know and so he was a little so here's his history

361
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:46,420
He's been to university which is don't confuse that with you know like he's got a PhD

362
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,180
He's done one year of university. It doesn't mean all that much now

363
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:56,420
He says he's going into the RAF which I think is great going to the Air Force please far away from my daughter

364
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,860
But he's been on the road for the past year or so as a guitar tech for this is now

365
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,340
It's now getting into the story. He was a guitar tech for a great big fish or some band like this

366
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,980
That Christina thinks is a really cool band

367
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,740
Are you with me now? Yeah, so he walks in here. What is a guitar tech?

368
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:19,620
It's the guy who tunes the guitar and hands it to the guitar player. Oh, sure. It's a roadie

369
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:25,380
It's a different word for a roadie. Oh, okay, so but the guitar tech sounds so much better doesn't it?

370
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:31,060
And so he walks into the office here and he's like wow well impressed with all your

371
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:35,140
Gold and platinum records and he's like cheap trick and you know he could aerospace and

372
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:40,740
Yeah, I couldn't believe the Michael Jackson CD and all this stuff. I sent a huh and he's like yeah, you know

373
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:48,260
I've I've produced these like kind of fumbling about stuff. He produced or whatever and and then we got into this conversation

374
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:54,020
You know about him going to the RAF and I'm trying to try to draw out of him what his real future plans are, right?

375
00:23:54,020 --> 00:24:01,060
He hasn't actually enrolled in the RAF yet. He's still trying to figure out what he wants to do and I really got

376
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,820
a sense that he was trying to hit me up for some connections

377
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:14,260
And it was like really apparent, you know, I'm like um wait a minute. All some the bells went off, you know and like

378
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:18,980
He said something and didn't move on to a topic kind of waiting for me to say hey, I can hook you up or something

379
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,980
Maybe yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

380
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:28,340
If you want to hear the rest of this and you're listening to us on stars series stars one o two you'll have to go to daily source code dot com to download the rest of the show

381
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,540
So

382
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:36,980
I think yesterday I really figured it out. I think that he may be look. I'm not I don't want to say he's using Christina

383
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,620
But I think that

384
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:44,180
He thinks it's very interesting. Yes, very interesting. There's some kind of show this connection

385
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:50,100
He knows what I do. He knows who you are. Well at the party he was wearing Christina's watch

386
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:58,420
And I said oh, just Christina's worked. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He said it's amazing all those diamonds and I said they're not diamonds

387
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,340
He said no

388
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:04,580
Diamonds. I said no. There's spot-off ski crystals. Oh

389
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:11,460
So oh, she said it were diamonds because Christina you know she doesn't give a shit about diamonds or

390
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,380
Yeah, and he's very polite

391
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:20,260
You know, he's he's too polite. That's the whole problem. I know

392
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:28,340
You know, I've got the same thing. I think are you for real? Yeah, and meanwhile I see these guys like like Tony and Dan and furgo

393
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:35,860
Man, I would give my left not to have her go out with those guys those guys are interesting and and really sweet and of course as Patricia

394
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,580
As Christina would say they're not really handsome

395
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,620
Well, and I disagree because I think they all have something yeah

396
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,980
Interesting, you know, we cannot force no of course not go out

397
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,580
But I really want to kill my own I really want to keep my eye on this

398
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,980
Suddenly we said we thought we both what I

399
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:00,260
Don't know about this. I don't trust it. It's too tonight. I didn't like it at all

400
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:08,100
Do not oh you have such a nice house Mrs. Curry. It is amazing. It looks so amazing and I thought you know

401
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,260
It's almost like this he it was almost like he made the wind up and he tried to pitch

402
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,820
Last night by saying yeah

403
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:21,060
You know, he's really looking for a gig and trying to you know do some more guitar tech work and yeah, but you know

404
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:26,260
Maybe the RAF so this guy is not going into your force. This is not an Air Force guy. Oh

405
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,060
But he he shaved his head already for it

406
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:36,180
Fool shit. Yeah, that's has nothing. I hate to I hate it. I love it men with hair

407
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:39,780
You told him that didn't you? I mean sorry, but for people you tell him that?

408
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:44,820
Yeah, I said grow some hair looks horrible grow some hair shrink your penis

409
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,460
away from my step away from my teenage daughter

410
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:57,940
Yeah, and it's so sad because I look at her and she said mom because she really she runs my opinion

411
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:04,580
But no, she wants you approval approval and it does not want your opinion now approval. Yeah, but why I mean

412
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:09,300
Because she knows because she knows that this guy is not so I need some help here

413
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:14,500
Want to know what do I know just go with the flow or well you have to I mean you can't do anything

414
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:19,460
But I do want to I just don't want it to be really disappointed because this guy might turn out to

415
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:25,540
I just and I know Christina is very smart and she is very intelligent

416
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,940
She's very little a little bit older than other maybe 16-year-olds

417
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:37,540
In some regards in in in a certain way and so that's why she likes to talk with older

418
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,860
kids and older boys so I

419
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,180
Don't know anyway

420
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,180
It was a good party. I'm so worried

421
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,860
I'm so worried but the party was a great success

422
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:54,420
But it was and I'm so happy for her that she had her sweet 16-party

423
00:27:54,420 --> 00:28:00,340
Yeah, you know because it when we lived in in in in Belgium she was quite along with her horse

424
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:06,020
She had her horse and she had a couple of friends but not as much as and many as she's

425
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,940
Apparently quite popular

426
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,100
Yeah, and you know and I look around the room and I know most of those kids too, which is nice

427
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,660
Yeah, and the and the and I got to say

428
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:22,900
Very well-behaved and all very nice kids. Yeah, and they're and they're you know anywhere from 15 to 19 and they were thinking us at the end of the unit

429
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,260
It was very actually scary

430
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:29,380
Incredible. Yeah, they're all thank you very much for inviting us for having me and we could party

431
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:35,380
Well, that's English for you. I have to say and that's very nice, you know

432
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,940
Although Americans are like that too, and then there were some playgrounds some plaque is out in the parking lot

433
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,020
Honk and their horn and midnight

434
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,420
Like yo Eminem

435
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,700
It's real I say no, I'm shut up. I'm shut up. I'm an amp

436
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,260
They look like I know Eminem

437
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:58,580
Okay, well enough about this. Yeah, I got some feedback for you here. Hi Adam. This is Charles Media wine guest 30 years old from London

438
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,900
Just in the future and yourself chat away on my bit

439
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,700
Always catching up on the get see

440
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,900
Which is also not going to see the crown jewels which I always thought the crown jewels

441
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:17,860
Were the the power of London, but then maybe there's crowns and jewels and dresses and stuff

442
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,380
Bucking up house who knows I'm not interested in that I guess because I'm a great. Let's face it

443
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:30,340
Why would I pay money to someone rich to go and look at their wealth? It doesn't make sense to me

444
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:37,060
There you go. Yeah, that's what I thought too. But you did it. Yeah, I'm not a Brit. Oh, this is true

445
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,820
Yeah, I'm just you know visitor you do pay taxes visitor

446
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,140
Miss visitor

447
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:47,940
Council tax you know, have you ever heard of it? Yeah, you should do believe me. You pay taxes

448
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,500
No, I mean, I'm not a Brit yet. That's what I'm five years until you come you want to do that in five years

449
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,260
I think so. Yeah, it takes five years and then they check. I'm fed up of being Dutch

450
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:12,180
I think that they do they want to hold for the country. They bring you know all the yanks come and look at their shit

451
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:19,380
Bring it a lot of you. Hey, baby. I don't know oh my god

452
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:24,020
16-year-old. Hello, baby. Hello, you're bitching about me. I totally heard it from Donald

453
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,580
Not about you. Don't mention about Liam

454
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:31,860
We're talking about Liam. We weren't we were not bitching about Liam. No, not bitching what? Discussing

455
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,700
He is a big slime ball come a little bit close to the microphone. Yes, it is

456
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:43,060
He is he's a slime ball. What are you going to go? It's town. I'm going to walk. Don't tell me who you're going to see

457
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,740
I'll tell you he said hi. I'll give you a regards

458
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,100
I want to find out when he's going into the RAF

459
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:59,060
That's what I want to find. What about your allowance by the way? Don't you have an allowance? I get that in a few days. So you have no more money

460
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,780
No

461
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:08,420
It's like mom give me money. I need money. I'm just going to buy some foundation. Foundation for a face

462
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:18,740
Foundation because the foundation could be also in here

463
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,020
So anyway, we're not saying that we dislike Liam. We just think that he

464
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,740
feels like other guys might be more right for you

465
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:33,300
And I know you don't give a shit. They're not ugly. I know you don't give a shit. I don't give a shit

466
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,540
But this guy yeah, I do

467
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:42,020
Furgus, that's why I love him. I love Furgus. You like to Judy Garland. I love does he cry when you do

468
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:47,060
I love him. I love Furgus. Furgus is the man for you. I will buy you

469
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,220
He's saying he's on west west side store. Of course he did

470
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:56,660
Listen when when you're 18 and you want to have an apartment if you're living with Furgus, I'll pay for it

471
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:04,020
Well, but it's Liam. Will you buy me a box? You're not going to live with Liam. That is not happening

472
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:08,260
That's worth in care of it. No, it's not going to happen. You kind of wanted to get one of those

00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,260
Caravans in the backyard

Impressed yeah, but I just get a feeling he's a little too much nice. He's from Birmingham

481
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,700
Oh, is that it? Yes, are there slime balls? No, so what's he doing now? Does he have a job?

482
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,020

00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:03,940
I wasn't listening. Wait, so this is the guy that your boyfriend you don't know what his job is. What?

00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:15,460
So we can still intervene. We can still intervene. Well, but he still he doesn't want to be your boyfriend. Oh, he does

486
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,940
But because I haven't said this yet. Very good. Keep it that way.

00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:27,540

Nice money. Okay. 630

519
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,860
630

520
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,220
6 and 7

521
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,140
Dan and Dan and Dan

522
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,780
Went so much trouble. A lot

523
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,260
And I'm pulling up her t-shirt every time. Yeah, I know that. I'm pulling it up. I'm pulling it up

524
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500
I mean

525
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,260
All right, let me just take care of a couple of things here portions of this podcast brought to you by

526
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,860
Acura listen to the target cast for the Acura RDX SUV at acurapodshow.com

527
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:16,740
And this is the third finalist in the earthlink had challenge. I don't have to explain what this is right

528
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,820
How memories everyone hated the original commercials and then we said I'm making yourself

529
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:26,260
Yeah, so this this may be the $2,000 prize win. No, earthlink got some bad press

530
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:30,100
One day announced that they were installing a free mune wifi access in New Orleans

531
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:35,060
Jeer about this or eat it in the news people started blogging and saying great now they have free internet

532
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,420
But no food or shelter

533
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:43,220
You know, I said that was somehow earthlinks fault. Okay. Now if I'm a large company looking to do something to help people in need

534
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,220
Okay, and I know how to do a thing

535
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,780
Internet service for example

536
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,740
Don't you think that's what I'd bring to the table and offer up?

537
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,260
Maybe

538
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:58,340
Why would earthlink offer to rebuild houses or provide food when they have no expertise in those fields, right?

539
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,460
I for one think it's great that they're doing something down there

540
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,300
But you know who fought them the telcos the cable companies of course

541
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:10,820
Then you about a new internet provider give earthlink a try at least they're trying to help and not get in the way a progress

542
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,220
That was pretty good. I like that one. Yeah, that's good. That's good

543
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,780
I actually didn't even know earthlink tried to do that

544
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,460
Mm-hmm. We could train a victims

545
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:24,820
It's almost one year since Katrina. I know and still fucked up down there. Oh, very it was just on the news

546
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:31,300
Yeah, but you know about people are still walking around with with no homes nothing. No help. No job nothing

547
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,180
They're crying. Yeah, yeah, yeah around crying and if you see

548
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,580
How it looks over there?

549
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:44,340
We haven't noticed but there's no coverage so people forget about it people forget about it because you know

550
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,340
It's more important to hear about it. Yeah

551
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:50,580
I'm thinking about it all the time. Yeah, of course. I mean

552
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:57,460
No, I'm not thinking about all the time, but if I see the pictures I think that's my point is you only think about it when you see the pictures

553
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,340
Yeah, actually yeah, you do

554
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,900
Okay, what are we out now? Well still no no house

555
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,100
No house

556
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,100
Look at the quality of your problem

557
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:15,380
Yeah, just said there people in in Louisiana New Orleans who have no house really no house no

558
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:22,020
Yeah, and now you're complaining about not having a house. Yeah. I know we're gonna take a look at one today though

559
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:28,820
Was that seam or place or whatever it is? Sydney Sydney place yeah, wherever that is. I don't know

560
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,380
So I guess the two houses we put bids on

561
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:36,260
We're not gonna get I don't know you know what we didn't hear anything from the last one

562
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,220
Every time we

563
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,460
It's too low playing this game

564
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:48,660
You know what I'm not just not gonna pay that kind of money for a piece of shit that we're gonna it is a piece of shit

565
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,420
But now but now we're looking a little bit beyond the town center

566
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:58,340
Yeah, maybe looking at five miles outside of gilford and that did open up a bunch of possibilities didn't

567
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:03,620
Yeah, we're a little bit of you know fed up with because looking in gilford and they don't want to move

568
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,460
They don't move

569
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,060
Been here for 20 30 years. They don't want to go any of them. They don't want to move and they're right

570
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,660
And when they do finally move they leave you know a piece of shit

571
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,220
Yeah, and we have to pay a lot of money for it

572
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,020
Well, and then in addition you got to fix it up to the way you want if you just want to

573
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,180
Gilford is popular

574
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,540
Very popular

575
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:27,700
Yeah, very popular. I think wherever we go as long as it's not Birmingham. I'll find with it

576
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,420
nowhere near that fucking medium guys

577
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:36,500
A new song from panic on the disco on the podcast music network. I write sins not tragedies

578
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,460
Think it like this one

579
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,500
The

580
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,160
This way, I'm in technically a merry-to-save

581
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,360
Well, this calls for a song

582
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,160
For the champagne

583
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,160
Oh, wow, the fact

584
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,960
Well, I'll look at it this way

585
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,440
I'm in technically a merry-to-save

586
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,100
Well, this calls for a toast

587
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:50,440
So, for the champagne, for the champagne

588
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:04,420
I like time in, with the having few people ever heard of

589
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,220
Closing a garden door, no

590
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,920
Much better to see, it's kind of pink

591
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,020
But this is the voice of the rest, and now I lay

592
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,920
I like time in, because I like to keep people ever heard of

A beautiful song, I'm going to sing the song

615

Oh, 7 years brilliant!

620
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,420
I wonder if they played on the regular radio in the picture

621
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,420
I love it

622
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,780
Yeah, I tried to see those guys. They were they were supposed to play in San Francisco

623
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,400
I was there last time. Yeah, what did they do? I loved that cello

624
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,940
Charlie's not a thing. Oh, I'm always crazy about that. Yeah, it does sound so much

625
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,940
Since Elo

626

You think it's difficult to move or buy a house in England try the province of Quebec, Canada in the city of Montreal

634
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:37,540
All least and rentals are regulated by the municipal government contracts expire every year on June the 30th

635
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:42,420
Everyone who has to move has to do it in that period Montreal goes crazy with moving trucks

636
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:47,340
No, yeah, so just like here when you have a closing you could have five families moving on the same closing
