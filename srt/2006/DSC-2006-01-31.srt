1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 3-2-7

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We don't need no sticky and grizzly

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I like to think I'm flying into the street

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Oh, fantastic!

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It is time for the Tuesday

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I woke up on the wrong side of the bed

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
My communications don't work out really

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's not the fish of the daily source code

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'll calm down though after the sun

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's Tuesday everybody, how are you doing?

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
They?

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Youúps?

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You?

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
They didn't hear that song

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I don't know

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Who wouldn't tell them about

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Do I really your feelings

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Wait, can you listen

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We've only been there

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Sing initely

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,840
Not you

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I don't know

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You could tell them about

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Don't listen

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's true to you, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Is true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I like it, but you're our show finally hit at the end

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:06,080
You're boleh-the-son, I'm gonna do it,

31
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,380
Don't mountain, don't listen to me

32
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:18,180
You'll never agree,千er still,

33
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,900
Don't behave so clichable

34
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,640
Don't misunderstand me

35
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:54,640
This is one of those mornings, this is take two of the show by the way that's far for the course for all my technology.

36
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,640
ValleyLodge, that song from the Podsafe Music Network, music.podshow.com, everybody's the daily source code.

37
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,640
Have you ever had one of those days where you woke up and the first thoughts that start to flood your head or about what you were thinking about before you went to bed?

38
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,640
Well, that's what happened with you this morning and it's just kind of gone downhill from the air.

39
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,640
I started off with me thinking about my mom, she talked to her last night, she's home.

40
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:24,640
But the doctor said that she had just about every single side effect and negative reaction you can have to chemotherapy.

41
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:32,640
Every single one, except the effects were three times the intensity to boot.

42
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:40,640
And they'd never seen this before. And when I hear that, I get really angry because I'm immediately thinking they did something wrong.

43
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,640
And I just want to find out what happened. She's home though.

44
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,640
The good news is her appetite is back. She's eating like a truck driver, no offense to trucker Tom, of course.

45
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:58,640
And she really feels much better. She's regaining her strength and she has her appetite. That's the most important thing.

46
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,640
The doctors now say they want to do, they want to try some radiation instead of chemotherapy.

47
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,640
So I'm going to go there on Thursday and get the full scoop.

48
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,640
You know, that stuff just came into my head this morning and like, and then as I did a quick check of the email,

49
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,640
I noticed that something was very wrong because there's no way I wake up in the morning. There's only two or three emails.

50
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:23,640
Well, that was the case because my email server. I have a server that is dedicated just a handling email sending it off to wherever I wanted to go.

51
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:30,640
Of course, can store messages as well, even though I might read them only on my Gmail account or elsewhere.

52
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,640
And I don't know if the box is crashed, you know, I can't just can't figure it out.

53
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,640
It's all those trouble tickets are on the way, but luckily.

54
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,640
And this is, this really is a testament to the importance of having a domain name.

55
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:49,640
And really being able to manage the DNS yourself through like GoDaddy for curry.com.

56
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,640
I actually use network solutions, I think.

57
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,640
It's not just a vanity plate for your email address, your website address.

58
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,640
It really does help you control your entire digital identity without being dependent upon hardware,

59
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,640
which, of course, is exactly what's happened in this case.

60
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,640
So it's fairly simple for me to go find an email provider.

61
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,640
I was thinking of doing this anyway, and of course, usually you don't do it until it's too late.

62
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,640
I was thinking of outsourcing all my email to a company that just does email only.

63
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,640
Actually, I've gone with the run box after about an hour and a half worth of research.

64
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,640
I really like what they're offering and they let me trial their stuff out.

65
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,640
And they, you know, I have an understanding of MX records.

66
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:37,640
So, but even there were some helpful screens there and, you know, to help me make the transfer of the MX records from the DNS.

67
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,640
And the founders of the internet, man, those guys deserve a medal.

68
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,640
They thought of some really smart stuff with this email stuff.

69
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:51,640
So if something goes wrong with the receiving email server, the sending email server will actually hold that for up to three days.

70
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,640
You've probably seen one of those messages that came back saying we couldn't reach this address after three days.

71
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
I'm giving up.

72
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,640
So the minute everything was reconfigured, my Gmail just started flooding up again with mail.

73
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:10,640
Of course, that in turn bounced, you know, all these attachments coming in at the same time.

74
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,640
I filled up my blackberry email box and, and that started bouncing stuff.

75
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,640
So it was a pretty interesting morning and I had to reconfigure email addresses for Patricia, for Christina,

76
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,640
for my mom, for my sisters, you know, all this stuff.

77
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,640
And then to boot my blackberries busted.

78
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,640
I have the new one, the new flashy one from Singular.

79
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Thing is the, what is it?

80
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
8700.

81
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
It's the thumb wheel.

82
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,640
And I'm going to call this a hardware fault and I've already said help.

83
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,640
I need a new, a new thing, although it's not going to be easy because, you know, what?

84
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,640
I'm going to express me one from the US, hopefully.

85
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,640
I think it's hardware because

86
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,640
scrolling down in any function I do pretty much works, but scrolling up the minute you do that.

87
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,640
It starts to interpret that scrolling up as commands that are not the commands of scroll up.

88
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,640
So if I go to the message list, for instance, I'm scrolling down.

89
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
It works fine.

90
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,640
But if I scroll up, then all of a sudden it goes to select folder.

91
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,640
And if I keep scrolling up, it starts throwing really weird characters.

92
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Like a Y with an oxalnte goo over it.

93
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,640
And if you scroll down, then the Ys are capitalized and then it's completely hose.

94
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,640
And even from the main screen, you can see scrolling right to select something works normally,

95
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,640
but scrolling left it'll get stuck and you have to roll it three or four times.

96
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,640
So it is the Achilles heel of the blackberry.

97
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:35,640
And I hope this is not something that goes across this whole range of new model.

98
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Because that sucks.

99
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
Just sucks.

100
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,640
And without it, the device is virtually rendered useless.

101
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,640
Yeah, I hate that.

102
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,640
So I'm going to say there's something else I was going to say about the blackberry.

103
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
I can't remember.

104
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
Was it about the e-mail stuff?

105
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
Anyway.

106
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,640
So it just went from bad to worse.

107
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,640
And then I started recording the show today's show.

108
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,640
And I don't know what it was.

109
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,640
But my just stuff, I was hitting button one and sound two was going off.

110
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
So I had basically just rebooted everything.

111
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
So I'm rebooting everything in my life.

112
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,640
I'm going to start this day over all fresh again.

113
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,640
And I got to keep my eye on the countdown clock because I was talking to PW Fenton yesterday.

114
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:28,640
Now as you know, PW produces the, the Syria stars 103 pod show four hours of podcasting entertainment

115
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,640
from six to ten Eastern three to seven Pacific.

116
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
Syria stars 103.

117
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,640
And this of course is a simulcast of the podcast on serious.

118
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,640
And you know, yesterday, so I was, I found out that there was a discrepancy between countdown clock.

119
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
It's timing.

120
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,640
And cast blasters timing.

121
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,640
And then I said the PW yesterday.

122
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,640
Because of course he has to deliver 24 minutes and 30 seconds exactly for the satellite window.

123
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,640
And he comes within a thousandth of a second.

124
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,640
He said, dude, you were 14 seconds off.

125
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
I'm like, what?

126
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,640
He says, yep, ever since you, you know, that new sound came in.

127
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,640
You started using the new sound when the satellite window closes.

128
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,640
You've been off by 10 to 14 seconds.

129
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,640
I'm like, I don't get it.

130
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,640
First of all, I have different timers, different time, different value showing up in two different

131
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,640
timers running on the same computer.

132
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,640
And then it started to dawn on me that maybe this, this to Shiba just can't keep time.

133
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,640
You know, I've never had that problem on the Mac.

134
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,640
So actually today, I'm running the Chimoo timer on the Mac, which I used to use previously.

135
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,640
I have there 14 minutes and two, one, zero seconds left.

136
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,640
Already the countdown clock is one second slow.

137
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,640
And I started them exactly the same time.

138
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,640
So I'm going to keep my eye on the Chimoo timer.

139
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,640
And then we'll see what the discrepancy is by the time we have to close the satellite window.

140
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,640
But what the hell is this?

141
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,640
Computers, it's not like the essence of what a computer has to do.

142
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,640
Is it, you know, at least it should be able to keep time.

143
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,640
Something weird going on.

144
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,640
And then the question is, you know, how do you call a timer function in windows?

145
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,640
I mean, you don't actually have to write the whole command.

146
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,640
You know, you have to write your own timer that counts back or what are the dependencies.

147
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,640
It can only to me seem like it's the computer chip.

148
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,640
And it's just an outrage that these things won't keep time.

149
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,640
And I'm telling you, I bet you it's the PC, I bet you the PC.

150
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,640
I don't think this is.

151
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,640
And of course, there may be a different clock that it's using for the internal sound card.

152
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,640
God knows what's happening.

153
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
Here's something interesting though.

154
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,640
This will kind of show you how I'll just say mainstream media thinks about podcasting.

155
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,640
But it's not entirely true because I had to listen to this clip of Howard Stern, which AJ auto sent me.

156
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,640
I had to listen to it a couple of times before I could analyze.

157
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,640
And I'll walk through it with you.

158
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,640
I think it starts off with a caller who calls in and I think the question was,

159
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,640
you know, how come I can't get the Howard Stern show as a podcast.

160
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,640
If you've been following the news, then you know that there's a,

161
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,640
I think there's a 15 minute daily podcast of highlights that's being made available,

162
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
but not the entire show.

163
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,640
And by the way, I think that I don't think I would listen to it myself.

164
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,640
I love listening to Howard Stern, but it has to be a live thing for me.

165
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,640
And actually, I'll talk about that a little bit more.

166
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,640
When we listen to the comments from Howard in the crew about podcasting.

167
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,640
Check this out.

168
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,640
I don't know how you do it, but it seems like it's possible.

169
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,640
I mean, but I'm not doing a podcast.

170
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,640
Well, I was just wondering, you know, I'm talking about the whole show.

171
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,640
I said, oh, just some of it.

172
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
No.

173
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,640
Already there's some hostility there.

174
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,640
That was coming from the back.

175
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,640
So the question was clear, but the answer is a bit surprising.

176
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,640
You know, Pike, if I go to a podcast, I'll start soon.

177
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,640
I'll start, like go knocking door to door and do it.

178
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,640
You go into a person's home and just do it.

179
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,640
Okay.

180
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
Yeah.

181
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,640
All right. Well, thank you.

182
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,640
But I don't understand those podcasts.

183
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,640
You know, Adam Curry, I think his name was.

184
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
The guy who used to be on MTV.

185
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,640
I listen to his show, the podcast show.

186
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
Yeah.

187
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
Okay.

188
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
First of all, Howard's no dummy.

189
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
Okay.

190
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,640
He definitely checks out everything that has to do with all forms of media.

191
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,640
So of course, he listens to the daily source code.

192
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,640
Of course, he's probably listening to it on stars 103 because it's only one channel

193
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,640
click away from his two channels.

194
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,640
And I'm sure that he's, he's very clued into what's going on.

195
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
Don't take that act.

196
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,640
You know, don't buy into that for a second because he totally knows what's happening.

197
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,640
Now, of course, he, he, he thought I was just some.

198
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,640
Well, check this out.

199
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,640
No, what that is.

200
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
It's weird.

201
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
I don't know what he's talking about.

202
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,640
I think he's a big dumb guy.

203
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,640
MTV.

204
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,640
But he.

205
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,640
Let me tell you a story about Howard Stern.

206
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,640
I think it was 88.

207
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,640
He was just becoming a meteoric star in New York.

208
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,640
And he was, and to me, he was, of course, I didn't know what podcasting was in 88.

209
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,640
But he was breaking all the rules.

210
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,640
He was a truly the original podcast.

211
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:56,640
And when it comes to a non-traditional format, he was still was constrained by frequency

212
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:02,320
and by time, which is, you know, how radio is divvied up and how it's monetized.

213
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,640
But he was doing something, you know, he wasn't doing the WNLNBC and all that stuff.

214
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,160
And he came to MTV to do a shift, which in the time of things like a four hour block of

215
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,400
programming, you tossed the videos and stuff like that.

216
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,280
And it was all recorded just in segments and the segments are shipped off to the Network

217
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,760
Operations Center and then they'd insert the videos.

218
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,760
Well, rather, they'd insert the VJ segments into the stream of videos, which, of course,

219
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,080
is a thing of the past.

220
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,240
And I was actually out for most of the day for whatever reason I came back.

221
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,040
And he was with doing segments with downtown Julie Brown.

222
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,280
And I was kind of remember her, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

223
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,040
And she was supposed to be doing the show with him or whatever.

224
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,640
And Julie Brown and I definitely did not get along.

225
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,520
He might call it some form of love, hate relationship.

226
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,440
But the balance was much more towards the age than the L.

227
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,000
And so I was like, you know, I'm not going to go up and, you know, everyone's kind of hovering

228
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,760
and, you know, everyone was a fan of Stern.

229
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,960
I just didn't want to be one of those gawkers, you know.

230
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,280
So I, and especially not with Julie Brown because I knew that she'd say something completely

231
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,240
fucked up that I didn't want to hear about, probably put me down and just, you know,

232
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,520
and I just want to talk to the Howard for two minutes.

233
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,600
So I figured I'll catch him later.

234
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,680
And they wrap pretty quickly and he left.

235
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,400
And then the next day on the show, he was talking about me.

236
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,600
I was an incredible jerk and I was arrogant.

237
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,240
I wouldn't even say hi.

238
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,960
And I was like, oh, I was crushed.

239
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,960
I was crushed.

240
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,920
And I don't think he's ever forgiven me for what he thinks was a snub.

241
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,920
But it wasn't.

242
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,080
And I remained a big fan of the show.

243
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,440
Anyway, maybe I'm just a big hairdo, fact from MTV.

244
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,520
It's come up with some kind of technology and all these podcasts.

245
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,000
Now, I hear people yelling and screaming about all kinds of crazy things on there and I never

246
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
know what they're talking about.

247
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,280
Doesn't any do a podcast podcast is no fun.

248
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,280
You know, why?

249
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,080
Because you need something where a group of people can get together and people can call

250
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,080
in.

251
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
That's the life of the show.

252
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
You do a part.

253
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,280
Now, this is a very profound.

254
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,280
See, I learn my lessons.

255
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,560
It's a very profound statement.

256
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,320
And this is, and this is what, how I know Stern knows exactly what's going on.

257
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:13,800
Because the format of his show, indeed, really only work works best in a live environment.

258
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,600
You have to have the, at least the feeling you can call up and talk to them live while they're

259
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
on the air.

260
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,760
That is a big part of what Howard Stern is about.

261
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,200
Robinson Tyre role is the news.

262
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,400
And if that's not, you know, the way they format it their show.

263
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:32,080
If it's not news that is happening that day, it doesn't work for the show.

264
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,360
So there's no reason to listen to that in delay.

265
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:40,960
I mean, I've had many opportunities to even subscribe to bit torrent downloads through

266
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,840
podcast feeds, to be able to receive the Stern show in a regular basis.

267
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,240
So you get four hours of a show.

268
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,600
It's something entirely different.

269
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,520
And this is what mainstream media needs to figure out in Lachon to.

270
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:58,360
They have the unique selling proposition of having regional and in many cases, national

271
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,680
live coverage.

272
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,320
And they have to start adjusting their formats to make that work.

273
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,720
For them to be able to monetize and continue with their business models, because when it

274
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,560
comes to asynchronous communication, and in this case, let's just call podcast information

275
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:19,200
or entertainment, it's a very different format.

276
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:27,960
And it's a completely different type of audio information and entertainment than is done

277
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,360
with live radio.

278
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,920
Of course, you can do the same with live radio, and it's done all the time.

279
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,320
But that's not the most effective use of it.

280
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,360
So when he says he doesn't get it, I think he understands extremely well what's going on.

281
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,360
But it will not work for the Howard Stern show.

282
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,960
I have to agree with him there.

283
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:54,560
And also, let's be honest, even if he were to change the format to an asynchronous version.

284
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,040
And the podcast where pay for play has an example.

285
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't think at this stage of podcasting, we would have been able to come up with almost

286
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,600
three quarters of a billion worth of dollars in guaranteed money.

287
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,320
You know, the 500 million plus the 220 million in stock, et cetera.

288
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,320
No way.

289
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,040
And Howard's not a young guy anymore.

290
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,320
He's, is he 50 now?

291
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,120
Is he a 47, 48?

292
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,120
He's up there.

293
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,560
How many more deals is he going to make?

294
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,360
You know, this is the retirement deal I think.

295
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,080
So, and he's still breaking new ground by making this step.

296
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,080
So make no mistake.

297
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,240
Let's see what else they're doing from your living room.

298
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,240
Yeah.

299
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,920
Well, doing it from your living room, obviously in an asynchronous format can be very entertaining.

300
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,840
There's a lot of stuff that come out of living room that a lot of people are listening to.

301
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
You know?

302
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,440
Yeah, I thought, you know, was the podcast is big shit.

303
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
Podcast.

304
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,440
Podcast.

305
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,440
Podcast.

306
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
Podcast.

307
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,440
Podcast.

308
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
Podcast.

309
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,440
You don't deserve to smell my shit.

310
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,440
Podcast.

311
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
Podcast.

312
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,800
Well, clearly Howard has never, nor Robin has ever listened to the daily download because

313
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,880
they are you do deserve to smell his shit.

314
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,280
I, that those last couple of comments kind of include me into let me know that they're

315
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,800
not worried about it because they're all paid and they've, and it's great and they haven't

316
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,200
fun, but it's on the radar.

317
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,200
So if you're listening to stars 103, every single weekday afternoon between six and

318
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:26,280
ten Eastern three and seven Pacific, it's the pod show line up, taking it all up through

319
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,920
10 o'clock on the East Coast, whining up with some pod sake music, all kinds of shows.

320
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,920
East radio.

321
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,360
You know, that, if Howard is listening to the source code, I'm sure he's listening to

322
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,360
East radio.

323
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,760
As your confirmation, match, not go out and get him girlfriend.

324
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
Okay.

325
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:49,160
Uh, I'm so confused, I had to start over again because everything was all met.

326
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,160
I messed up.

327
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,160
Did I already talk about the countdown clock?

328
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:57,720
Like, I don't know if I did, I had to, gosh, this is horrible.

329
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,640
There's a discrepancy for some reason, something is going wrong with, I really, I don't

330
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,400
know if I just talked about this and not, I did the first time I would start to record

331
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
the show.

332
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:13,160
Uh, there's something wrong with the countdown, uh, timing on my, um, I might just sheba laptop.

333
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,600
I was talking to PW Fenton yesterday and after, you know, we discussed all this about

334
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,400
running two timers and that the countdown clock was off compared to Casplaster's timer.

335
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:29,120
He told me that the whole show was still off by 14 seconds, which means, for some reason,

336
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,200
this laptop is, can't keep time.

337
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,240
You can't, you know, I'm not going to believe that it's hard for any application made

338
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,440
by an independent or by Microsoft to actually just display time and count back.

339
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,560
Isn't that like a primary function of, of computers?

340
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,400
So I'm running the timer on the Mac as well, because when I was using that, it worked fine.

341
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,800
And so there I have three minutes, 47 seconds left.

342
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,600
Looks like everything's still pretty much on time.

343
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,120
So maybe when it comes down to the last few seconds or something, it starts to, you know,

344
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,000
really shift out of phase, I don't keep my eye on it for you.

345
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,280
In the meantime, let's, uh, let me see, what do we have here, when we roll out this, this

346
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,880
audio comment, it's pretty long one.

347
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:22,360
I was talking about Patricia's ability, apparently, to feel the, um, the raise or the,

348
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:28,200
the radio frequency coming from a cellular phone mass located very near to the cottage.

349
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,520
And I got some interesting, um, comments back about this, the most interesting one, probably,

350
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,640
is from Trucker Tom.

351
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,320
Yo, Adam, Trucker Tom here.

352
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:49,120
I was listening to DSC 326 where you were talking about, uh, Patricia's arthritis, uh, doing better.

353
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:56,400
It's really likely that, uh, wherever she is at, uh, she's getting minerals in the water.

354
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,880
The mineral content of the water can make a big difference in something like arthritis and other health problems.

355
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,720
I was skeptical at first, but after taking the mineral supplements for only a short time,

356
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,120
I noticed the difference, uh, I had started experiencing some aches and pains, including aches and

357
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,480
pains in my hands, and after I started taking the mineral supplements, uh, those aches and pains

358
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,480
went away.

359
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,400
I'll send the bottle to the pod show HQ, so Patricia can try it for herself.

360
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,960
The only thing I ask is that, uh, you let me know how it works out.

361
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:37,600
As always, you can find everything I'm involved in at truckerphoto.com.

362
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,880
See, yeah.

363
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,320
Trucker Tom, where the signature trucker Tom to.

364
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:51,760
Of course, you know, that is, we hadn't even, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

365
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,280
Hadn't even taken that in a consideration.

366
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,800
It was a very unscientific test.

367
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,360
I have to admit, just saying, well, you know, there's no cell tower there so that must be it.

368
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,120
But Trisha actually, I think I'm going to talk to her about this and I think she definitely

369
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,320
knows where to get some extra mineral pills or whatever, and I'll ask her to check that out.

370
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,920
So far, actually, it's not like she slept here for two nights and has had incredible

371
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,280
pain, so it could be something else.

372
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,960
I did tell her, though, I said, if you keep telling me about this, if I keep hearing

373
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,120
cell tower, cell tower, we're moving regardless, whether it affects you or not.

374
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,080
I don't want to hear this for the rest of our days here until we've built a new house to

375
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,560
go live. And I'm moving out of here if I have to listen to that crap.

376
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,520
Some transmitters send the strongest signals out in a certain angle of vertical degrees,

377
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,120
as John Vermont, so the signal hits the ground fairly far away from the source.

378
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,600
You know, this thing is on top of the hill. We're underneath it, so I'm pretty confident that it's

379
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,040
rolling straight down towards us. And we've probably got the strongest amount of signal possible.

380
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:58,560
He says, if I would get to choose where to live in relation to a 3G mass, for example,

381
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,920
I would choose to live under it. And that works signal. I would get would be very

382
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,920
weak compared to what the guy a kilometer away gets. It would still be more than enough for me, though.

383
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,800
Well, I of course can get a radiation meter and I can check it out and see how bad the radiation

384
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,880
is, but I think we're pretty much in the full, full blown view of this stuff.

385
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,200
It's interesting because the neighbor across the street has horrible migraines. I'm starting to think

386
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,280
there's really something to this, you know? All right, those of you listening to us on stars

387
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:32,000
103 on the serious satellite, our window is about to close Pacific Coast. Hellway is next

388
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,040
followed by Madge Weinstein, then Donandru. And it looks like the countdown clock is two seconds off

389
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:51,200
compared to the old method. Now, I've timed it on three timers, three. So one of them has to

390
00:24:51,200 --> 00:25:00,080
come at least relatively close. I would hope. We'll no doubt hear this from Professor Pdeb when he puts

391
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,400
everything together for the pod show. More comments on the GSM cell phone masks.

392
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:14,960
Hey Adam Jack Elias from the GetJacked podcast. Getjacked.Honomas.com with an audio comment on today's

393
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:23,200
DSE326 two audio comments. I guess first on Patricia's ability to sense the electrical fields

394
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,720
and radio fields. I totally believe that that she can sense that many people can.

395
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,640
And interesting, I used to work for a large one of the largest manufacturers of cellular

396
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:47,120
telephones. And as a rep and we were a given a a wrote scripted response to reply whenever

397
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:53,120
anybody asks us about the specific absorption rates, which is what the federal communications

398
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,960
commission calls the the microwave energy rating as, you know, to safety rating for coming

399
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:09,120
off of a cell phone. And basically, we were to say, quote, all name of giant multinational

400
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:16,320
corporation here, cell phones are designed manufactured and tested to comply with FCCSAR guidelines.

401
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,640
And then someone would say, hey, Jack, see the black helicopters are coming from. Yeah,

402
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,840
someone say, hey, Jack, but, but, you know, as it's safe, and I would have to say, all

403
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:34,640
name of giant manufacturer cell phones are designed manufactured and tested to comply with FCCSAR

404
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,560
guidelines, which leads me to another point. Not a people use headsets, whether wireless or wired

405
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,680
to avoid holding the cell phone next to their head for fear of these absorption rates of

406
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:54,320
microwave energy. My question when I was a rep, especially, but even now is always this, if you

407
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:01,040
don't want to hold the cell phone next to your skull, how is it safer to clip it to your belt

408
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:07,680
using a wired or wireless headset, where it is now radiating its energy next to the the soft

409
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:16,560
tissue of, you know, your kidney area versus the thick skull area. You know, very, very good point

410
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:24,240
there. I always keep my cell phone in my pocket and I was wondering about what that means to my equipment.

411
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,520
Still works last time I checked. Stu Coates says, Adam, listen to Delta Sierra Charlie

412
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:37,440
326 loads of information about the effects of cell phone mask can be found at mastaction.co.uk.

413
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,800
It's the National Campaign for the sensible sighting of masks. You'd be shocked where phone

414
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,640
masks are actually placed. Some schools have them in the playground. Well, for all the information

415
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,320
that we don't have on these things, that definitely doesn't seem like a very good idea.

416
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,760
If you get more about that and also I hadn't received any information about death right if you know

417
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:04,880
what's hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Yes. I have a message for you. Would you mind talking

418
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:11,120
into the microphone, into that microphone? Okay. I have a message for you from your pilot.

419
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:17,280
From the wing commander. Yeah. The wing commander wants to it's urgent. He wants to talk to you.

420
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,080
He was trying to call you, but he couldn't reach you. Okay. Well, I can't talk to him right now.

421
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,360
I'm doing this. I know. I said that to his wife. Okay. So this is the message. So we can't fly Thursday.

422
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,480
Is that what the message is? I don't know. It was very urgent. Of course. He was somewhere

423
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,600
calling from from the air. He was in the plane. He was in the plane. I think. Well, that's not going to be

424
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,640
easy to reach him. No wonder he couldn't reach me. I don't know. That's what he's wife said.

425
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,560
Okay. Who called? Who called? He and him or Mercurife. So who do I have to call him or her?

426
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:58,720
No, uh, uh, nay. Who? Really? Okay. Thank you. Message service.

427
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:09,440
I've been watching Commander in Chief. I bought all the all the back episodes on the iTunes

428
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,920
music store. Oh, man. I don't watch them. I'm the video iPod. I just watch them on the on the

429
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:19,120
power book. And interesting. You know, I just sit there. My name on business. No other audio

430
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,760
applications open except for iTunes. And I'll be damned if just about every single episode, the

431
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,960
audio looping problem didn't show up. Very, very, very annoying. It lasts for about eight seconds. If you don't

432
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:39,200
do anything, then it goes away. What a great show. Oh, man. Uh, let me see. As I said, lots of audio feedback

433
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:45,520
today. Oh, um, the numbers are in for Mark Cuban's projects. Mark Cuban, you know, he sold

434
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:51,120
broadcast.com for, I don't know, he put, I think he put a billion dollars in his pocket is what they say.

435
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,560
I don't know. You can't look in anyone's pocket. But he set up this network of digital

436
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:03,600
cinemas and uh, Steven Sondberg created a movie called Bubble. And uh, this movie is being released

437
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:11,760
simultaneously in their own uh, chain of theaters. I think they have 32 theaters on DVD and on cable

438
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:20,160
TV. I think it's on their high definition uh, channels. And uh, so uh, this is actually an article that

439
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:25,760
I found at variety.com. And that kind of slamming him because, and of course, they're right, you know,

440
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:33,520
the gross of 32 theaters, these new digital theaters was $72,000. So, you know, that real

441
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:39,040
boils down to about 30 people per theater. Now, of course, you know, you can't compare

442
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,600
this movie, Bubble, which I've not seen. I'm sure you can't compare it to a King Kong, right?

443
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,240
I think like that, they'll get a huge draw from people. But I do think it's, it's pretty brave

444
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:54,320
what, what he's doing. Um, and, and of course, you know, let me see what is how does this article

445
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:02,720
and it's kind of mean. Let me see. Uh, uh, but for the most part, uh, the audience was basically

446
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,280
what one expect at a low budget art house film, people in the industry and connected to the film.

447
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,000
There you go. Another non-pro, a young woman who said she was just visiting from New York,

448
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,600
said she was seeing the movie because she was friends with the casting director and then melted

449
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:26,000
into a crowd of six other people. So mean. Um, but anyway, so it did work, but it seems like, you know,

450
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,560
I don't know how the DVD sales doing. I think that they're 100 million, 100,000 DVDs that

451
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,960
ship, not sold, but were shipped. And of course, they added on their TV stations. I hope you

452
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,440
pull that off. It's a big game. Very, very big boys, game that he's playing. Uh, shoot too bad. The

453
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,840
serious sidelight window closed. This was for the serious said management. Yeah, I'm this is Louis from the

454
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,920
cause of totally connection. Hey, I want to tell you a real live story that might help you

455
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:54,000
sell a few more serious videos. So anyway, we sent you our promo right and it was, uh, we before

456
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,200
last. And, uh, a download daily source code and we didn't you know, look at the show notes.

457
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,760
Hey, the quality connection promo is going to be on the show. So I'm happy to see it, right?

458
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,800
Now, like, hey, if we're going to show before the little beeper thing went off, that means we're

459
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:14,080
going to be on serious radio too. So what do I do? I take the freaking day off work. I go to

460
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,920
end of my local electronic retailer and I buy a serious radio. Now, I'm not kidding. I used to be an

461
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:25,040
XM subscriber, but I went and bought a stupid serious radio so that I could sit at home and

462
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,280
sit to clock that night and listen to our promo, go across the serious airways.

463
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,360
Guess what happened? It was Martin Luther King day. Somebody dropped the ball. I'm not sure who

464
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,960
it was, but, uh, we didn't actually get our promo plate on serious that day because, uh,

465
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,960
yeah, well, whatever. Anyway, uh, hope I could give you the opportunity to play our promo again.

466
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,640
But, uh, sure that I thought I'd let you know that, hey, you guys sold a serious radio and

467
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,800
I guess the only thing you have to do to sell more of them is just keep playing people's promos

468
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,520
for the first time. It used to work for me. Anyway, thought I'd let you know that, uh,

469
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,280
when we say tailwinds, it means something totally different. So, uh, I'll see that one. Anyway,

470
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:12,960
yeah, check us out with quads to wikinection.com. I'll do it. I messed it up. See, I spent so much time

471
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,200
bitching and moaning about my, my own problems that I just didn't make it into the satellite window.

472
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,160
Okay, send me another promo. I promise you I'll put it in early in the show. Quasitility,

473
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:29,360
boys. I'm so sorry. Hey, I found out that the indeed is absolutely no problem to submit as many

474
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:37,680
podcasts as necessary, um, from one account into the iTunes music store. So, um, I haven't said this

475
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,920
up yet, but I'm going to see if, if I think what we would want to do, it'll be very cool. It seems

476
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,520
like it would be a web application that we could make. If you make it, I'll use my account.

477
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,800
Basically, the submission process is fairly simple, but you have to have an account.

478
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,480
Um, so I'd like to set something up so that anyone who has a podcast in a New Zealand,

479
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:05,040
was it, uh, was Australia as well or just New Zealand? Well, if you can't open an account

480
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,600
because there is no iTunes music store for your region, then we just make it like a simple web

481
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,560
form so you could use, like, my account or anybody else's account to submit your podcast. I think

482
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,920
we could, we could set that up. So, um, I'll get to work on that. And this is actually Richard

483
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:26,480
von Iperin, uh, said that he has been able to, uh, to open up to submit many podcasts through one

484
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,800
dot mac account, which makes sense. Makes sense. Uh, okay. A couple of promos, maybe I should call

485
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,720
the wing commander while you're listening to these. Hi, Adam Scussie, John for the brand new

486
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:43,840
little show podcast for 22 years. I've been in radio for the last year. I've watched an MV.

487
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,720
Guys, like you had to create a freedom to do what you wanted to do while I sat my little

488
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,880
air-conditioned studio getting yelled at because the bits were longer than two minutes.

489
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:57,200
Well, as of two weeks ago, I am no longer a morning man and commercial radio. I know

490
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,000
longer work for clear channel. I can do what I want. And I have my own podcast, scotted.com

491
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,680
scot.h.com. Check it out. And one thing I'd love to do is I'm playing music from the pot

492
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,520
safe music network. How about we set up an interview show with the artist? Would they be into it?

493
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,600
Would you be into it? Let me know. I'd be into it. 22 years in radio. I've interviewed a lot of

494
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:20,160
people and I think it'd be fun. Let me know. But check out the podcast scot.com. Thanks.

495
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,680
Hi, Adam. This is Copper from the garagepunk.com podcast. And I just wanted to thank you on behalf

496
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,240
of all of our podcast show producers for fighting the good fight for podcasting and for all of the

497
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,120
work you put into the pod safe music network. And I'd like to invite all your listeners to check us

498
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:42,960
out sometime. The garagepunk.com podcast is basically a podcast radio station similar to a college

499
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,600
republic radio station where you'd hear various different programs with separate show hosts.

500
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,480
This gives each program its own distinct personality and helps broaden the scope and appeal of

501
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,360
our station. And so far it's been very successful. We currently have seven shows in rotation,

502
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:02,960
basically one new show per day, and we'll be adding more soon. All of them features some form of

503
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,880
primitive rock and roll. We're talking the really trashy obscure stuff here. All the new garage rock,

504
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:15,760
garage punk, greasy R&B, broken blues, sleazy surf, frantic rock ability, obscure 50s and 60s

505
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:22,160
rock and roll in garage 45s, 70s pro do punk, power pop and wild and wooly modern garage punk noise.

506
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,920
Let's face it. This ain't the kind of music that will ever have much of a chance on commercial

507
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,360
radio or most mainstream media channels, but is perfect for podcasting. Not only because of its

508
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:37,600
obscurity and independent degenerate nature, but because it's pod safe. All of it. So check us out at

509
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:44,240
podcast.garagepunk.com and subscribe. You'll be glad you did, but your neighbors may hate you for it.

510
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,840
Thanks again, and stay sick.

516
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:26,480
Hi Adam, this is Laura Nostomon speaking. I'm studying physics at the University of Innsbruck in Austria,

517
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,960
which is one of the leading universities when it comes to quantum optics and quantum information

518
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,880
or quantum computing. Friends of mine and I recently came up with the idea of a physics podcast.

519
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,080
Would it like to answer questions sent to us why are you male? Or discuss with our listeners,

520
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:47,120
why us type about interesting physical phenomena and dichanist stuff? We're going to do this

521
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:52,800
podcast in English, although our mother tongue is German as Austrians clearly. Because first of all

522
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,160
we want to reach quite a big audience and on the other hand we're going to practice our scientific

523
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,760
English as a matter of fact. And yeah, I'd just like to hear your thoughts about this. Is it worth

524
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:10,160
doing it or anything special to consider when starting a new podcast directed to quite a few people?

525
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,360
Yeah, thanks for your time Adam and I'm really looking forward to hearing your thoughts about this.

526
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,560
I'll send you promo when we're ready to kick off. Thank you for now and bye bye.

527
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,520
I would kind of dunk. Of course you should do a podcast. You're crazy? Of course.

528
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,840
The only tip I can give you is just do something you're passionate about or you're interested in or something

529
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:36,240
you want to talk about. That's it. It doesn't have to have any more or any less. That'll make it

530
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,720
compelling to listen to. I guarantee it. I'm sorry, this is a two-spliff day.

531
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,880
Definitely give me some insight into string theory.

532
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:52,720
If you've never heard, what is that? The astrology podcast?

533
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,320
Man, what is the name of that thing? Hold on. I might as well look it up for you. I want to do this.

534
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:05,200
I love that show. I've just looked in my subscriptions here.

535
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:15,120
Draw low G. What was the name of it? I've used this an example so many times.

536
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:26,560
Astrology. That's not astrology podcast. I can't find it. Okay, but there's lots of them out there.

537
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,600
It's really I think depending on the audience you want to reach. If you want to reach an audience of

538
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,840
your peers, then you'll probably want to keep that pretty technical and it may not be interesting to me.

539
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:42,640
You can also, of course, always try and translate it to people who are just interested but have no idea

540
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,320
what you're talking about. So that may be a bigger challenge. But certainly could be a fun one.

541
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:55,280
Particularly if you're trying to hone your English language skills at the same time. So it could be

542
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,360
pretty cool. I'm going to skip over a whole bunch of stuff. What are we at now? We're like at 40

543
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:06,480
minutes. Okay, listen, let me do the final feedback I was going to do for today. What else did I

544
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,680
have to talk about? Oh, yeah, I want to talk about Google.cn. Here's something I discovered.

545
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:19,040
This is the Chinese Google. If you miss Spell, a forbidden word, like Tiananmen Square,

546
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:28,400
it will still give you all relevant links, which it thinks are close to what you tried to spell.

547
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,200
So definitely type in Tiananmen Square. If you don't know how to spell Tiananmen,

548
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,400
all the better, but even try to purposely miss Spell it and then click on the images link, which is

549
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,880
the squiggly second to the left or right next to the far left link at the top of the page.

550
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,600
It's a Chinese character, which stands for images, I'm sure. If you mouse over it, you'll see the

551
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:55,760
URL actually says images. And then you'll get all kinds of very graphic pictures from Tiananmen Square

552
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:02,400
on google.cn. So there's clearly all kinds of ways around this. And I'm starting to think more and

553
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:08,480
that part of the deal is Google just can't talk too much about it. Maybe they're actually doing

554
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,680
some really good things here. I do give them a little bit more credit than all the bashing of

555
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:20,480
I've seen going on. All right, final piece of feedback. It's about digital sales and the

556
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,600
pot-safe music network, but it leads into our last pot-safe song of the day. So I do want to play that one.

557
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,400
Hey, I'm at Stank Cody, the drummer of the reverse engineers. I wanted to give you some feedback

558
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:40,160
regarding how much the artist should receive out of digital sales. And I do think it's best to

559
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,760
take a look at what we actually are most artists are receiving from the various big digital

560
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:53,200
download services out there. And even an idea, music net actually gives us only like 2,000

561
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:59,280
cents of a cent. It's like 0.002 on each sale through music net. So that's like one of the

562
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:06,240
streaming services that is not the actual song, which is part of the radio stream. Now, obviously,

563
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:13,760
we make a lot more money on iTunes. In the iTunes and in the U.S., we make 65 cents per download.

564
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,880
Canada, iTunes, Canada is pretty close to that around 64 cents up to 67 cents per download.

565
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:30,240
And our per digital sale in MSN music, we make about 70 cents per download. It's a little bit

566
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:37,840
more than iTunes surprisingly. With iTunes Europe, we actually make a lot more than we do in the U.S.,

567
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:47,840
we make up to 81 cents. In iTunes, UK, we make up to 83 cents. So it's interesting to see that over

568
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,960
in Europe, for some reason, we make more on our iTunes sales than we do here in the U.S. So

569
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:00,880
have this comparison to the pot safe music network. I think if even if we had 70 cents per

570
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:08,720
download, I'd be happy with what we'd be making. I love the fact that pot show is actually going to

571
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,400
not be taking their share at this point. I mean, you guys are setting up the system. You obviously

572
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,000
want to beta tested. But even if you guys took 30 cents, we'd be still happy with that because that's

573
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,360
seems like the average right now of what the digital sales services are actually taking as their cut.

574
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:32,800
But we're really excited. We can't wait to see what happens with these sales.

575
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,520
It's great. We're looking back on how the pot casting has helped us so far. We're actually

576
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,480
getting a lot of our visitors are coming from the podcast. We've been played on. It seems like

577
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,920
about two thirds of our hits these days are coming from podcasts that people are finding

578
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,800
either through the blog for the podcast where they have a link back to our website or just the podcast

579
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,240
we're mentioning. It seems to be driving a lot of traffic our way. So we're really happy about that.

580
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,800
But I just want to give you some feedback and the people play one of our songs that we really

581
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,640
cool. We've got a new single called Sunshine of the Shave that we've released on the podcast.

582
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:22,000
I just want to give you a few back out of it. Thanks again. Thank you again.

583
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,560
All right, your wish is my command.

584
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,520
Another love knife to the sunrise.

585
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,320
Here's the sunshine in the morning.

586
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,920
Another mistake in making what's this trip worth taking.

587
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,240
It's the sunshine in the morning.

588
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,920
There's the silver in the sky.

589
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,920
There's always sunshine in the city.

590
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:27,920
There's always sunshine in the morning.

591
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,920
There's always sunshine in the morning.

592
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,320
I'll get a blast for the long day.

593
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,440
She was the long road until next time.

594
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,280
And nothing to stay in making.

595
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,800
Now I'm just going to take you.

596
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,120
Can you still remember in the morning?

597
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:19,120
There's always sunshine in the morning.

00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:25,120
There's always sunshine in the morning.

599
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,120
It's all been in cover.

600
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,120
It's all been there.

601
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:35,120
It's all been discovered.

602
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:41,120

609
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,960
There's always sunshine

610
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,840
and there's always sunshine

611
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:42,280

613
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,920
Alright, thanks for listening to me, bitch, and today I'll be back tomorrow. Hump day

614

615
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,120
in the shade, everybody!
