13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
60 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Fantastic. It's Adam Curry.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And it's Tuesday, every month,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
coming to you from the M4 hotel in Amsterdam and Netherlands.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's the Charlie on the road.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
A bit of skimming, perhaps.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Screaming like a stone.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Over the surface, a floor I know.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I smooth rock that my home got has thrown.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And I'm just looking for my home.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm just looking for my home.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm just looking for my home.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Back to the wall, back to the wall, back to the wall.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Into the corner, into the corner.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Into the corner, into the corner.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Screaming like a stone.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Many miles traveled here.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Many, many more love to go.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And I am not afraid of the things I've found.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No, no.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And I won't be afraid.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The fire starts flowing down.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And I'm just going to the wall, back to the wall, back to the wall.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Into the corner, into the corner.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Into the corner, into the corner.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Into the corner, into the corner.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Into the corner.

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Into the corner.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Into the corner.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Into the corner.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Into the corner.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Into the corner.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Into the corner.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Into the corner.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Into the corner.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Into the corner.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Into the corner.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Into the corner.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Into the corner.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Into the corner.

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Into the corner.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Into the corner.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Into the corner.

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And into the corner.

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Into the corner.

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Into the corner.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Into the corner.

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Into the corner.

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Into the corner.

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Into the corner.

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Into the corner.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Into the corner.

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Into the corner.

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Into the corner.

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Into the corner.

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Into the corner.

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Into the corner.

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Into the corner.

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And the war fought through the road now into the crew

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Great

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Skimming like a stone

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Over the circumstance, the war I know

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Of the truth, the rock that my home got has thrown

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And I'm just looking for my home

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And I'm just looking for my home

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And I'm just watching

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And I'm just coming

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And I'm just looking for my home

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And I'm just looking for my home

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And I'm just looking for my home

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And I'm just looking for my home

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:29,720
My carico, and skim in kicking off Tuesday's edition of the Daily Source Code, everybody

90
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,640
how you doing, coming to you from the Amstall Hotel and Amsterdam, the Netherlands, that

91
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,280
will of course account for the difference in the sound.

92
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,240
I think I sound a little bit nasal.

93
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,040
What I've done is I've hooked up the Portage A laptop with a running cast blaster.

94
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,480
All I've hooked up externally, of course, our headphones, which I'm monitoring the signal on,

95
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,960
and I've got my wireless live set up.

96
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,440
You'd love this actually.

97
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,680
I like traveling with this live microphone because it's so incredibly small yet.

98
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,880
I find the sound to be better than most small microphones.

99
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,120
And I really, you know, if you want to have a carry on and you want to fly with

100
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,520
easy jet and you want to take two laptops and a change of clothes, your court clothes, no

101
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,120
less, you really got to slim it down in size.

102
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,680
So, no big mics with me on the road today.

103
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,840
I've got the love clip on to an avion bottle actually.

104
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,040
Here we are.

105
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,320
Today is the day of the big trial.

106
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,960
It is me against the publisher of this gossip magazine that took pictures from my flicker

107
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:42,800
site and published them across three pages of a spread in their magazine.

108
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,040
There's some other things that go along with this lawsuit, for instance, the publication

109
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,760
of my daughter's school and how she is taken to school and picked up every single day.

110
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:59,560
Of course, just the whole idea that some, um, editor, some chief editor gave some, some

111
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:06,960
greasy guy with a camera, you know, gave him the assignment to go follow my daughter

112
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,000
freaking creeps me out.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,600
So that's what we'll be talking about in court today.

114
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
That's a 230.

115
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,000
It's still relatively early.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,400
It would be none of you in the UK.

117
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,800
So 10am here and I got the show all set up for you.

118
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,680
So we're talking a little bit about the suit today, a couple of things I want to run through

119
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,000
and you know what?

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's so cool to be in Amsterdam.

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,680
First of all, it's really, really, really, really cold.

122
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,200
Got up this morning and it was snowing and they're expecting winds of up to 30 to 35 knots.

123
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,320
So it's going to be cold, windy and snowy and the room is, I can barely even heat the

124
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,560
room up.

125
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,760
And this is such a great hotel.

126
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,800
I got to tell you, it's, I've been here with three or four times in a row now in just a couple

127
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:54,240
months and, and no wonder when royalty comes to the Netherlands or when the stones come

128
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,440
to play, they all stay at the Ansel Hotel.

129
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,800
These guys definitely do get, you know what, let me, let's order some coffee here, hold on

130
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
a second.

131
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,960
Let me see if I can do this room service.

132
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,960
I definitely need to be caffeinated.

133
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,960
Let's see.

134
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,960
There we go.

135
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,960
Good morning.

136
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
This is not a room service.

137
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
I'm out here.

138
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
Good morning.

139
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,960
Could you send up a pot of coffee for me, please?

140
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,960
I've got a share with you.

141
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,960
Room number 414.

142
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,960
Yeah, you wouldn't happen to have senseo coffee, would you?

143
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:39,760
No, I'll just a pot of coffee will be good.

144
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
Okay.

145
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
All right.

146
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
Thank you.

147
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,760
Well, we'll have to change that.

148
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
No, won't we?

149
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,920
No, we just have Nescafé.

150
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,320
What does that mean?

151
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,240
So last night, I'm like, I'm sitting here.

152
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,920
And of course, when you're an Amsterdam, you know, there's certain things that I like

153
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
to sample.

154
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:07,480
It's a very particular to the culture and to the commerce of the city, but it was so

155
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:12,640
called, and so I called my buddy, taxi, Eric, I said, you got to hook me up.

156
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:18,840
Now, of course, global chillages, global chillages, the name of the coffee shop, where I usually

157
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:26,000
get my medicine from, which used to be right near the bunker in Amsterdam.

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,880
Remember those days, so the how cool is this?

159
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,400
So I said to Eric, I said dude, it's too cold, I'm not, I don't want to go outside.

160
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:41,960
He says, no worries, and so he sent one of his cab driver buddies who was in the neighborhood

161
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,520
of the global chillage facility, they go pick up a little order.

162
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,320
And it's funny because the order was pretty specific, and the first thing they said in

163
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,240
the coffee shop was, oh, it was Adam back in town, hey, tell them to stop by one of these

164
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
days.

165
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,120
Okay, moving on, oh, you know, I forgot to say on yesterday's show, what an incredibly

166
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,120
cool time I had on Friday in San Francisco, every Friday we have the Fubar Friday at

167
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,240
Pod Show, which means probably run four o'clock, sometimes a little bit later, usually

168
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,240
not much earlier than that, in fact, we probably, we usually have to drag one or two folks

169
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,240
away from their computers.

170
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,840
We just stop, you know, when we have the Fubar Friday consists of, well, always consists

171
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:27,480
of alcohol and food, and sometimes it's at the office, we've had some pod save bands

172
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,840
show up to play, sometimes we present to each other what we're doing.

173
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:37,920
But as I said, it's usually food and alcohol, and this past Friday, we did it across

174
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,600
the street at 21st Amendment, which is this great bar, which is just right next to the

175
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,200
Pod Show headquarters.

176
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,480
And Adam drew it and invited a small intimate list of friends and fans, so it was about 40 or

177
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,640
50 people in addition to the 30 people that we are at Pod Show, and it was fantastic.

178
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,320
I met so many incredibly amazing people, some who had traveled great distance just to

179
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,600
come up to the, to the Don and Drew Hangout, it was, it was absolutely amazing, it was

180
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,920
great meet and all you guys, a couple of podcasters there as well, and they're starting

181
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,920
to send me emails and promos and just shows I've never ever heard of before.

182
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,400
So just wanted to say that that was a, you know, it really was a lot of fun.

183
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,760
And kind of a, like, I can't, hold on a second, we just check and see how my microphone

184
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
is still in here.

185
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
Okay, we're good.

186
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
I'm battery power.

187
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,560
Oops, almost knocked over the microphone stand.

188
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:40,240
The Avion Battel, interesting and exciting news as it looks like we're going to be opening

189
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
up.

190
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,160
Well, office, you know, I'm sure there'll be an official announcement about this at some

191
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:51,800
point, and an office is not the right word, but we're opening a pod show LA, or maybe

192
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,400
I should say we're opening up a shack and Venice Beach, which will be primarily occupied

193
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,520
by Mark Yoshermode or Nemcoff.

194
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,200
You've probably heard of, heard me talk about him.

195
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,400
He does the podcast specific coasts the hell way.

196
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:10,160
And, you know, we're going to be doing something which I think is exciting, and certainly

197
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,280
in the podcast arena is different, we're actually going to think up stuff, think up shows,

198
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:22,000
think up ideas, and produce them, and produce them with, well, I would have to say, you

199
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,480
know, independent talent.

200
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,480
Yeah.

201
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,680
And of course, in Los Angeles, there's a lot of independent talent out there that's waiting

202
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,000
on tables.

203
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,240
So we're looking at a drama series, which actually is written, and I've seen the backstory

204
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,880
and heard the characters, and it's just, you know, it's phenomenally exciting that we're

205
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,880
going to be doing that.

206
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,040
They'll give some other things in the works, there's some video stuff that we'll be working

207
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
on.

208
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,200
And all this is, you know, super, super low budget, I mean, just listen to Pacific Coast

209
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
hell way.

210
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,920
I mean, it's got a three series for Cry 6.

211
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:03,440
Game show, I think we're working on, and what does it, there was another, I can't remember.

212
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,160
Anyway, so, you know, I'll be letting you know more about that as time goes on as weeks

213
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:14,960
progress, and as we have stuff to show and tell, but I'm really excited about new productions

214
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,520
coming on to the scene, and this also means that there's going to be more opportunities

215
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:25,880
for voice talent, for production talent, for writers, my gosh, writers, so hard to come

216
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
by.

217
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:34,520
In fact, just in general, it's hard to really hire great people, an email showed up, what

218
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,520
is it?

219
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:42,320
Let me see if I have it here, an email showed up today, an internal pod show memo.

220
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,400
Let me just share this with you, Kevin and Sue, are reviewing applications for three new

221
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,640
positions at pod show.

222
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:54,200
We're looking for software engineers who specialize in PHP, Java, C, and email.

223
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Do you specialize?

224
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,640
I think email applications is probably what that means.

225
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,840
If you know someone with these skills, who may be interested in working with us, please let

226
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,320
me or Brian know and check this out, if pod show hires an engineer who comes to the company

227
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,440
specifically through your referral, you'll be eligible for, oh my gosh, $1,000 hiring

228
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
bonus?

229
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:25,920
Wow, dudes, let's, hey, I want $1,000 bucks, come on, come on, work for pod show, we'll split

230
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,040
the $1,000 bucks, okay, I promise you, so that just goes to show how hard it is, everyone

231
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,360
is like working at Google, man, holy moly, it's unbelievable, those guys are hiring like

232
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,400
300 people a week, if you want any type of engineering down, you're either going to get

233
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:49,160
a very different type of engineer, which, by the way, we have, and I'm very, very happy

234
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,160
at all the, all the talent that we have within the company, but you're not going to get

235
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,960
you're classically trained engineer, and that's for sure, I'm quite honest, for some

236
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,160
reason, Ron and I don't seem to attract a type of person.

237
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,600
Hello, Adam, it's me, Matt, I'm going to make it quick, because I've got to go to the

238
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,040
arrow, where to drop me, Hermana off, I'm speaking a little bit of Spanish, because it

239
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:17,120
was in Miami too long, I'm going to make it snatchy, snappy, I need help, my Gmail is

240
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:25,120
at 100% and it's bouncing email, it's said when I signed up for the Gmail that I'll

241
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:32,280
never have to delete another email, I don't overuse it or abuse the Gmail, I've had it

242
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:40,720
for over a year and then it fills up, I've been increasing in requirements of space and

243
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:50,600
a very, very, very standard rate and it's bullshit, so I need more space, and I announced

244
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,600
it on my show, but I don't think the Google's listened to my show, but they do listen

245
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,280
to your show, I need my space, why don't they just change it so they figure out how

246
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:07,120
much space you use, you know, you're a delta and why don't they just let you just go up

247
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,040
a little bit more than that delta every day? Why can't they live up? They said you never

248
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,200
have to delete another email instead of giving me more space than they put a fucking delete

249
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:24,720
key on my goddamn Gmail account, that's bullshit and they're lying and so much for

250
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,680
do know we've a okay, I mean I can get over the China thing, I'm not Chinese, you know,

251
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,320
in America, you're not censoring fine, you're not Chinese, I like Chinese food, but

252
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,200
this I'm not even complaining about the censorship or whatever, but listen, I need space

253
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,960
for my goddamn Gmail for my bloated lesbian account, I am not going to give people a

254
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,480
different email to mail me because Gmail lies about how much space I have and I'm

255
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,280
just please fix it for me, oh god damn, I've already talked for two fucking minutes,

256
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:11,840
god damn Google. Oh yeah, match is back and it's pissed and bloated as ever. Good point,

257
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,960
match, you know when I really think about the the offering that Gmail makes, I have to

258
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:21,640
agree, they do really make it come across as if you'll never have to delete another email

259
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:29,400
again and that your account grows with you. Now I got this 4 gig a 4 gig account, which

260
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:37,840
is my special little when you call it, my little geeky hero of the nerds gift, but that

261
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,840
hasn't grown, in fact I've been deleting email for the past month or so, I've been constantly

262
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:48,720
hovering around 98%. I don't know what to say, I guess I could go back to my channels one

263
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,480
more time. At the end of the day, I'm willing to pay for this stuff. I love this service

264
00:16:53,480 --> 00:17:00,440
so much. Honestly, it pisses me off too. Maybe with a new offering, the corporate Gmail,

265
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:08,760
maybe we'll be able to purchase space at some kind of unlimited amounts. So I'll look

266
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,760
into that for you, and then we'll just get a pod show account and we'll be able to give

267
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:19,080
you unlimited space. I hope, I mean, it's almost, you know, a Google really, first of

268
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:24,840
all, it's not do no evil. That's incorrect. It's don't be evil. I see this misreported

269
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:31,840
all the time in every thing in the New York Times, in Newsweek, in Time, all over the internet,

270
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:41,200
Google never said do no evil. They said don't be evil. There is a subtle difference there.

271
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,880
They are like crack dealers. They give you this shit. And, you know, it's like, hey,

272
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,800
come on, I'm going to send you an invite, special party, come on, don't you want to be cool?

273
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:57,800
Like all the other kids and try some of this. And so you start smoking the Gmail crack.

274
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,120
And then you're really getting to the shortcuts and you get into the labels and the fact

275
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,920
that you don't have to delete a single solitary email. And then just near the very end,

276
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,960
all of a sudden, it's like, oh, you know, we're not there. Maybe we'll drip a couple more,

277
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,760
just a couple more grams of the good stuff to you as you start to near your limit. But I agree,

278
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,720
magic, you get one MP3 in the email and boof. That's why I continuously ask, please stick your

279
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,280
MP3s up on a server and don't just email them to me. I'd much rather say email them to me.

280
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,920
And I'll pay for it. I will pay for that Google. Magic, I'm going to bat for you. I'm going

281
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,200
to go look for it. By the way, just regarding email in general, I've noticed that I've become this

282
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,560
neurological filter for looking at my email. If you want to get through to me, first of all,

283
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,840
don't expect the days of, hey, I just went through my entire inbox and I feel really good that I

284
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:54,720
clean it out. Forget about it. I currently have 21,441 unread emails. That's not to say that I haven't

285
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,200
seen the emails. Now, this is an important point. And just in general for your email etiquette,

286
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,160
I think the, you know, the important things that you should be doing if you want to get your message

287
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,880
across, you know, obviously something that I think everyone starts looking at in their inbox.

288
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,640
I'm looking at my inbox right now is, is the from. Okay. So who's it from?

289
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,440
And I'm just looking at the list in Gmail. So who it's from is going to make a difference. Of course,

290
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,040
I can set up, you know, all kinds of, and I've done this before. I set up labels and filters. And then,

291
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:31,360
you know, basically you wake up one morning and see your company label has, you know, like 35 emails.

292
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,360
Like Christ, man. So it just becomes as burden. And I'd rather kind of had the serendipity of,

293
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,440
I hope I catch it all. And if not, so I want to resend it, it appears at the top of the list.

294
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:49,760
So the next thing I look at is the subject line. Okay. Subject line is really, really important.

295
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:56,640
And in Gmail, actually, the first, I'm going to say the first 10 to 15 words of the first line

296
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,560
of the email actually show up kind of grayed out, but they show up as a preview on each individual

297
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,880
lines. You've got the sender. You've got the subject and then you've got the first couple of words

298
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,040
of the usually the first sentence, almost the first sentence. Despite if you hit a character turn.

299
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:19,760
So it's like here, what I get Todd from ID3 podcast mags. ID3 podcast mags. See, this is no good,

300
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,320
because he used the, his from and subject are basically the same. Hi, Adam. I wanted to write

301
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,680
and introduce myself, my name is Todd. Okay. Oops, hold on one second. That's the coffee.

302
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,680
Don't go away.

303
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:02,880
Okay. Right. Sorry about that. I will get to the cafe in just a second. So anyway, just in general,

304
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:09,520
we should be looking at our email etiquette and take a look at Gmail. I think it's, I think that's

305
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,160
pretty good. You know, within those three pieces of information. And in addition to that,

306
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:20,640
Gmail also gives you a little, what is a little indicator if the email is sent to you on the

307
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:27,600
two line or as a CC, which is also important. And that's really, you know, that's, you got to

308
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,880
market this stuff. And even if it's, if it's a purely business, you've got to just know what,

309
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,840
I mean, eventually we're all going to wind up in some version of the place that I'm in today.

310
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,760
We, you really will. It's just a complete information overload. So I kind of treat it like my

311
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,960
news aggregator. You know, it's like stuff goes by and traveling is the worst, because if you travel

312
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,200
and then you open up your email, you know, their emails that may be two or three screens deep.

313
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,800
Forget about it. You just can't get to it. Oh, for the days of an RSS based system.

314
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,120
Ah, sometimes I go to bed thinking, how can we make it better? How can we make it better?

315
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:10,880
Email here from Paul Sabie. Adam regarding yesterday, uh, Roger Smalls. I, I'm pretty sure

316
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,080
Roger said in the past, he does not drive. You know, I thought he, maybe I am confused with the

317
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,600
mini Paul, but I thought Roger, I thought Roger Smalls also said ones that he, maybe it's not a mini.

318
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,720
Oh, shoot. Well, the maybe wasn't him that was in front of my, you know, coming away from my

319
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,640
host or driveway. I thought that he was, he had driven a mini around Gilford. Maybe I'm wrong. So,

320
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,400
okay, then maybe it's someone else I should be concerned about.

321
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:44,160
Ah, let me see. Ah, a message. This is, uh, shoot. Have no, you know what? What is this?

322
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:53,680
No, I won't do the message right now. Let me move on to, uh, since we're about to, uh, close the window here,

323
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,960
on the folks checking out the podcast on, uh, on Syria sidelight stars one or three. Yeah, just really

324
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,120
briefly on this lawsuit. Um, I lawyers picked up something really, really cool, which I just wanted

325
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,920
to share with you. The fact that these, uh, that this magazine grabbed pictures from Flickr

326
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,400
means they automatically entered into a license with me and I'll read this piece that they found

327
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:28,400
on Flickr, which is just fantastic. Um, here it is. By exercising any rights to the work provided

328
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,840
here, which of course I have the creative comments, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms

329
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:41,040
of this license. So Flickr actually in, in their wisdom have created, uh, almost a, uh, a

330
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:47,200
ulla, an end-user license agreement, which is very comparable to when you, uh, open up the CD-ROM

331
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,840
for Microsoft Windows. Uh, there's all that, you know, that sticker on it and all those, that really

332
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,560
fine print essentially says the same thing. It says by opening up this envelope, you hear by

333
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,840
agree to the terms of the license, which is written in these really fucking small letters. Uh,

334
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,120
so I just thought that was brilliant. So I, I feel really confident about today and those of

335
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:13,360
you listening in on the stars 103, uh, you'll have to tune in tomorrow, uh, to hear, uh, how it went

336
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:19,760
down. The actual judgment may not be for, for 14 days. I, I now understand. Uh, of course,

337
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,480
alternatively you could always download the podcast at dailysourcecode.com. Pacific Coast

338
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,440
Hellwise next for those of you on the satellite followed by East Radio and Don and Drew.

339
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,600
So we'll continue here. Let's get to that message.

340
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,480
And I've been closely into your body since I'm up in for the full spirit of my 15 year career.

341
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,920
I'm the human side of perspective of a deep understanding of the fundamental tribe and purpose of

342
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,080
the industry. I've been informed of particular opinion and skill set to a discussion on the

343
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,400
evolution of the industry in its future. It starts there with over 10 to 15 years ago,

344
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,640
distracting the attention and stealing our time. I'm talking about technology and innovation,

345
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,640
it's a faster and becoming exponentially more dangerous. I'm going to be fine,

346
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,560
better equipped and sharply focused, more invasive, where are you taking this and having more

347
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,600
cleverly humanity? You know, I really hope you guys can hear this guy okay on your ear buds.

348
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,320
Um, I got the the most volume I can get out of cast blaster on this particular piece of feedback.

349
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,400
He's got, it's like he's standing in a brook or something, but he does some of some really

350
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,080
interesting points to make. Um, so let's just continue to listen.

351
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,680
I enjoy my videos. I like pre-packaged food. I like to learn how to offend with my personal

352
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:33,040
hygiene. I like comfortable clothes and lifestyle. I don't get into this as fast and

353
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:39,120
what I'm undertaking with information and I like you from time to time, would like to be

354
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:46,160
not aimed. But I also just want to trade my hard earned currency for the product to service

355
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,200
in my choosing and be on my way. I mean, the price of the volume is marked. I've fought over

356
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,120
the tax in touch with the antibiotics, and to the next time I choose to participate in its process.

357
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,560
Look, I realized when this is breaking news, I didn't report to be the chance to be on the

358
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:11,120
subject. Maybe you can see this tomorrow day. Or maybe I'm just can say that the only exposed exposure

359
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:19,040
it's well. I am an anonymous American, and I am a conspicuous consumer. And if I

360
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:24,160
complied to identify it specifically exposed, the most least is that it was in this video cycle.

361
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,680
Are we going to talk about the focus on its ever-advolving acquisition of my American mindset?

362
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:36,080
From the LEDD to the idolatry and micro-solvering on the films, from the technical

363
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,680
sports and it's faithful followers to the infotainment and product placement, propaganda and

364
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:48,160
policy and politics, the media in all its mass restrictions, constantly snatching your attention.

365
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:54,400
I mean, it's time just sensitizing and distracting us from fundamental universal human concerns and interests.

366
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,720
Wait, wait, wait, I just want to stop you there for one second, because this stuff is actually

367
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,800
really good, and we should have a live conversation about it. I just just about grabbing

368
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:12,000
attention for a second. Let me just say that the amount of time I spend on bullshit that takes

369
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,160
my attention in my email is more, it's in minutes, it's more time, and it is definitely more

370
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:26,480
frustrating than sitting through any advertisement, listening to any commercial, and that's just

371
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,120
purely by volume. Just want to stay that.

372
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,840
Then, adding the reason I'm coming to you with this is simple. I've firmly believed that the

373
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,440
future of making an advertising is on a promotion based platform. In other words, the messages

374
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,960
that shared and will be acceptable are imposed to a person around the inside. Are the ones from

375
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:57,280
companies who respect our time and attention as a most valuable asset can suit us such. The

376
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:03,120
evidence, practically the way that it has minds here is our time to focus attention to the energy

377
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,480
and the energy that I value of such. If we possibly share a more multi-mixage in my case,

378
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,600
why for years, we do not deserve even a respect or a met patronage.

379
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,520
So, let's say, I want information on your product or service, I can easily find your

380
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,000
on my own. In the 30, having a pre-sayship to sell product or service,

381
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,120
I would be more than happy to spread that message to my student once, that being found

382
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,440
has colleagues, family and so on. That's what the example of this course and the permission

383
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,840
based marketing of which I speak, is your relationship with sincere employer? It's in there.

384
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,760
No, no, I don't come for you to illustrate it for such an individualism. So, be it.

385
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,320
The heart of compensation to have a family, of course, at the birth rate.

386
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:56,000
Just one little brief thing there. I have no relationship, commercial relationship with

387
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,520
either Senseo or Apple. So, those examples weren't the best, but I do understand the gist.

388
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,760
No style of gossip, much better. Now, in any respects, if you're much appreciated,

389
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,280
I don't afford a possibility of working together in the form of my self,

390
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:40,080
depending upon what you're doing. That's it. That's what you're looking at.

391
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,200
And I really like it. I don't know what to say about it.

392
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,200
All right, and honest American, thank you very much. Well, a couple of things about that.

393
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:54,720
In an ideal world, and let me just say one thing about RSS, I don't usually like to talk

394
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:00,320
about all the technology underneath everything. But RSS is pretty critical in our world today.

395
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:07,040
It is the default methodology for publishing and subscribing to information. One thing I could

396
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,200
imagine, and it would be great if it really worked out. But I have my doubts,

397
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:18,640
is what if along with this podcast, there was a separate feed. And this feed was, and you could

398
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,440
subscribe to this. In fact, you would be encouraged to subscribe to it. And this feed contained

399
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,160
advertisements. It could be audio advertisements. It could be video advertisements. It could be a

400
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,560
PDF. It could be a number of things that would come through. And you were subscribed to that.

401
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:38,640
The theory is, in this case, is that you would subscribe to it. And you would listen to the show

402
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,440
and that you would know that there would be products and services that would be advertised.

403
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:51,040
When you want it, based upon your permission. So, you make the decision to go and look at the

404
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:58,720
feed of commercials or advertisements. The theory there is, is that they would contain information

405
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,320
that you would be interested in. Not very easy to do, by the way. There's some real easy ones.

406
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,120
Pretty much everyone may at one point in time want to drink a coke. But otherwise,

407
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,920
it's to individualize it would be incredibly beautiful. But I don't know if that's going to be

408
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:24,000
possible. And of course, the, you know, the issue really is, is will people subscribe to a show

409
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,400
and to its associated advertising feed? I think in some cases, we could actually try that out and

410
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:34,960
see how it works. Of course, the other way is to say, well, you know, here's where the advertisements

411
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:41,200
are. They're at the beginning or at the end of the show. Or whatever the mashup is that you're

412
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,560
making, we just happen to call it a podcast today. You know, have a, have a, have a listen if you want.

413
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:56,000
At the end of the day, there has to be money coming in. And I don't feel that, what you're

414
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,520
suggesting there is a little bit too much of a one-way street because, and I'm not talking about

415
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:08,800
podcasts, who are podcasting to bring you the love that they want or, you know, just have something

416
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:14,080
to say. I'm talking about people who want to produce and write and create something and they're

417
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:21,680
art, you know, just like an artist can make a song and put it out either in iTunes or sell the CD through

418
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:27,440
CD Baby or these days as we ramp it up, be able to sell an MP3 through the podcast music network.

419
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:36,160
I mean, why is that, you know, we have no problem at all paying 99 cents for an MP3 that is usually

420
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,960
three to four megabytes in size, whereas I create an MP3 every single day, which is 20 to 40

421
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,760
megs in size. And, you know, no one's going to pay me 99 cents for that. Yes, it's a few people

422
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:54,720
mind, but not enough to, I don't think enough to blip the radar. I really don't, whereas I've seen plenty

423
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,320
of sales of MP3s of independent and pod safe artists do quite nicely. Yeah, I'd settle for a

424
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,640
couple grand a month. So, you know, the dialogue is open. Let's, let's continue thinking about

425
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,520
this, let's continue thinking, better and smarter because not only do we have, are we changing

426
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,800
media, we're changing, advertising, and perhaps the way advertising is brought. So, very open to

427
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:24,080
it, of course. I got something here from, from K2 at the office. He sent me this link about

428
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:32,720
watermarking, which is, in other words, digital rights management. And, let's see, what is

429
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:41,280
this article from? This is from KatherineCramer.com, and the title of the article was,

430
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:48,480
was it, watermarking as a strategy for insisting on corporate creators, is DRM the killer app

431
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,240
for corporate authorship? And, and the gist of this really is, is that DRM is not necessarily

432
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,240
being put in place only to stop people from copying stuff, but it's creating a gatekeeper role.

433
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:08,480
And, the theory there is that if you have consumer devices, which today may support, you know,

434
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,400
quick time movies in MP3, but essentially have all of this watermarking recognition technology

435
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:22,800
built into it so that if you play a Hollywood property, let's say a movie, or a CD for a major

436
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,080
label, that it will play on that device. Then, of course, the only thing they have to do is

437
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,680
once the device is, once they hit on the right device. And, by the way, Apple could do this

438
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,240
at any time they wanted it. I don't think they will, but at any time Apple wants, they can say,

439
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,480
you know what, we're not going to allow MP3 to play anymore, and they could just shut it off,

440
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,760
and then what? I mean, of course, there'll be plenty of players, but you understand the basic,

441
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,960
you know, the basic problem here, that when you popularize something, and let's just face it,

442
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:57,360
you know, the Ricky Javez podcast is very successful, besides the fact that it's good, but mainly

443
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:02,800
because Ricky Javez was a well-known media personality with some well-known media properties,

444
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,080
and queue factor. Isn't that what it's called? The queue factor.

445
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,760
So, you know, popularizing devices that could then potentially just shut off any other type of

446
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:20,080
content playback, could be a huge problem. And that just goes right in line with what we're talking

447
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:28,240
about the other day, about a second internet being built, which will charge companies for access

448
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:34,320
to their customers, about the mail spam, you know, the email services that make you charge,

449
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,480
you know, that make you pay $80,000 to ensure that your emails are actually delivered. I got a

450
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,720
couple of emails from people saying, hey, man, that really solves some problems that I was working on.

451
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,760
I didn't understand why my email wasn't arriving, you know, on registrations. Yeah, no kidding.

452
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,880
All right, let's talk briefly about the pod safe music network.

453
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,360
Adam, over the PMM, I've got my podcast to account.

454
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,080
What have been the ratings? You know, it's all gone. I want to be able to hit the button and say,

455
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,640
you know, that's a good song, you know, give it a little more credibility or that's a bad song, you know,

456
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,960
I don't not too happy with it. I'm seeing the great purchase button, then I'm not seeing any

457
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:17,120
ratings pop up. So, if we could get that brought back into play or, you know, at least,

458
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,680
what happened to why did you get rid of it? The other things on remember me, yeah, that's a nice

459
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,200
feature to have and you know, I enjoy it, but there are sometimes when I want to be able to hit

460
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,680
log out and see what my listeners are going to see when they hit the link, you know, is it just

461
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:37,360
working right because I'm a podcaster and automatically, no, or, you know, it's just, so are we going

462
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,800
to get a log out button? Or am I going to have to go in and remove cookies each time? So,

463
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:48,160
can you see your insight on that? So, thanks, Adam. Bye. All right, man. Okay, so first the log

464
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,600
and stuff. Right now, we're writing a cookie to your, to your machine. So, you stayed logged in,

465
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,320
you got that right. There will be a log out function, there will be an automatic log out function.

466
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,760
This is all part of bringing everything together, we're incorporating podshow plus, which is our

467
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:10,480
listener interface, soon to be released. We are integrating podcast alley, integrating pods

468
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,080
of music network and so you have one single sign on for everything in the podshow universe.

469
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:22,720
So, you're kind of stuck in the middle there, we will be enabling that, you know, the automatic

470
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,240
log out or just a log out button general. I've always been a big stickler about the PMN where I

471
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,440
hated having to log in every single time, but I understand that everyone thinks differently about that.

472
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,920
So, that's cool. That's being worked on. Then the ratings, I don't know what happened to the ratings.

473
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,960
Somewhere in the back of my mind, I remember a conversation about it, but I'm sure Chris Rockwell will

474
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,480
give me the, the load down. And when he hears the show today, I think that this might have just

475
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,080
been a temporary interface thing where we're just, because we're, we've put the, the buy logo in

476
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:58,560
next to every single song, although on almost every single one of them, it's still great out as we

477
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:05,120
continue to continue to test the purchasing function of the MP3s through the pod save music network.

478
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:11,120
And also the whole idea of the listener interface, right now the pod save music network is really

479
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,800
just a meeting place in a licensed place, if you will, a place of licensing and exchange

480
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,280
for independent artists and for podcasters. Of course, as a listener, you're more than

481
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:27,120
welcome to come in. Right now, all we really have for you is a way to do some rudimentary search.

482
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:32,000
It's not the best in the world where aware of that. You know, you can listen to songs in full

483
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,120
length with it, which I think is very cool. And of course, you can, you can purchase the MP3s

484
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:43,600
free and in the clear. We will have a much, the entire pod show plus will have an integrated

485
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,640
listening experience so you can, really, as a listener, you can do a lot more with the pod save music

486
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,360
network. So that's also on the way. We're playing with it right now. I mean, just that we have this

487
00:39:53,360 --> 00:40:00,160
player that is so freaking phenomenal. Let me see, was there something else I'm going to say about that?

488
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,120
Now, see, there's another question here about the pod save music network. Ben Lurchon,

489
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:11,280
listening for about nine months now, but I was excited to hear something other than pod save for

490
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,640
piece available for purchase on the PMM and waiting too long for this. Love the concept of

491
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:22,560
pod save music. Ah, okay. Here we go. I heard on the daily source code 342, I could download

492
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,480
American Heartbreak and Matthew evil. So I clicked the pretty green button and gave all my info to

493
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,800
clicking by that includes my birthday. Right. I'm 15. I have a visa box card, which is kind of like a

494
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,240
debit card. Pretty cool. Check it out at visa box.com, BUXX. So I never expect any trouble when

495
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,840
I sign up to buy something and it sort of surprised me when clicking by a told me that could not

496
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:50,720
sign up unless I am 18. Good point. Hmm, I don't know what the deal is with that, but it seems like

497
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:58,480
that would be a shame. I think I thought that by law, you only had to be over 13 to participate in

498
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,360
commercial transactions. Something I'll definitely look into because we'd like, you know,

499
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:08,400
why just try lying on the sign-ups. You would have it. Just say that you're 18 and then report

500
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,640
back to me if it worked. Derek Richardson checks in. Hey, Adam, hope you're well. Just given

501
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:18,800
update about purchasing from the PMM. I registered. It took about 15 minutes, which seems very,

502
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,880
very long to me, but after that, perfect. No problems. Now I have purchased copies of every day

503
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,000
were Christmas, best of luck with the court case today. The fuckers. Yes, okay. One regards from

504
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,640
Derek. And then, oh, this is from Michael Butler. I'll hold on. I'll do that in a second. Let me

505
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:44,560
just move that down in my list. I want to play one last podcast I've song for you. I was going to

506
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,880
do, oh, yes, this is the internal podcast. A question that's come up more than once regarding

507
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,640
the podcast music network. I Adam, this is Martin from Southampton in the UK. I'm a long time

508
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:02,480
listener. Ever since I got my iPod, what two Christmas is ago. I wanted to ask you for your opinion

509
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:10,320
on internal podcasts and the use of music from the Podsafe music network. I suppose I should

510
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:16,800
probably explain what I mean by an internal podcast. I work for a large IT company and we're already

511
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:23,120
doing podcasts, which go on our customer-facing websites and listen to my customers, etc.

512
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,000
But we're also starting now to use podcasting internally for sales, training, new

513
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,640
production announcements. That's sort of thing. Now, I'd like to start one of these

514
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,960
podcasts, these internal podcasts myself. And I'd kind of like to use some music to top and

515
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,680
tail the show. Give it a bit more interest, make it more listenable. And I'd really like to use

516
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:52,960
some music from the Podsafe music network. So I'm just wondering what the deal is with using that

517
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,840
music internally when, of course, my feed won't be available on the internet. It's only on our

518
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:05,360
internet and how you account for that. Anyway, love the show. I hope that you can give me an answer

519
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:12,320
to this. Bye. All right, dude. I don't think it's a problem, actually. I don't think there's anything

520
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:18,400
in the terms that forbid you from doing that. As long as you report back, and obviously,

521
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:25,120
so what I understand is you can't actually put a link to the podcast itself. Well, if you report

522
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:31,120
back to the network, and you place the links to the song pages and the artist pages themselves

523
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:37,920
in your internal show notes, I think that's fine. Shouldn't be a problem. And use this as as

524
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,720
your evidence and court, if there ever is a problem. So I could grow incorporated, came out with

525
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,960
a new video. I don't know if it was last night or the night before, but I watched it last night.

526
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:57,040
Oh, man. Soccer girl, I love you. You're out of your mind. Very, very, very, very creative.

527
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,600
Hey, man, I'm ready for this, this court case today. I want to go kick some ass. I'm going to

528
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:06,640
line that up with the piece of Podsafe music. Michael Butler, of course, the Rock and Roll geek.

529
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:13,120
Frequently, let's me know what's going on. He works with lots of people helping them get on the

530
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:20,240
PMN. And that includes some labels, East West Records, a label that's part of the Warner Brothers

531
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:26,720
group. They have about 10 subsidiaries. Have put up some of their lesser known acts onto the

532
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:32,080
Podsafe music network. So you can go look for East West Records. You can just search by it

533
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,240
and you'll see them show up. And then, and this was kind of cool. This came from,

534
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,800
see, a suggestion internally at Pods Show home. Let me just bring up the page here for a second

535
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:49,680
for this guy, because he was pretty interesting. His name is Val, was it? No, not that, not Val Davis,

536
00:44:49,760 --> 00:45:00,480
the hell. No, no, no, no, no, no, shoot. Here it is. Ola, onabule. God, I don't know if I'm saying that,

537
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,680
right? Ola. Ola, onabule, maybe it's that. It's kind of like a seal-looking guy,

538
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,040
which makes sense. And I'm reading from the bio here. Ola is considered to be the UK's finest

539
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:16,880
soul singer songwriters and performs over 100 shows a year in the UK Island in Europe. He's emerged

540
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,000
as an artist of distinction, honing his writing and production skills at the same time evolving

541
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:30,160
into a passionate and committed performer. So it was Greg Mann from the Pods Show sales and marketing

542
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,680
department who passed this on to a Michael Butler. And you know what? Shit kicks ass, man.

543
00:45:46,880 --> 00:46:13,280
Oh, where you're gonna go? And now that soul town's gone, how you're gonna do?

544
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:26,720
What has been so long? What's your life right at the tip of the Larry Assants of Koo?

545
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:35,760
In Street, Saturday and Friday, I still ain't gonna lie for you. I don't know about his food,

546
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:46,160
it's my life right at home. What you're gonna say? When they talk it down,

547
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:56,480
that I've the peak of its day, it wasn't nothing, nothing but a plane change turn.

548
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:05,600
You know, say so times the way it's all gonna be, and someday we'll build it all again.

549
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:19,600
When we've had enough of the sentiment, the bottom of the zone, and then we'll start a fresh breeze and a bend-o.

550
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:57,200
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

551
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,200
Oh

552
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,760
When you're gonna see

553
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:07,040
That's all sounds

554
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:12,400
And all those beautiful people you use to know

555
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:16,460
Well, they ain't so fast

556
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,100
You riding high in the front of skies

557
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,680
Just be in the past you're proud

558
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,200
If we were dreaming your heart, something that may be

559
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:37,200
You thought that you'd better change in the world

560
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:43,200
You'll say, slow down, so pretty, yes, but it makes you new

561
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,200
Someday we'll feel it all again

562
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,200
When we were having love, I was searching for you

563
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:54,200
Love too much of a lonely day, we'll start a lecture

564
00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:01,200
Let's go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

565
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,200
Where'd you gonna go?

566
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:12,200
Now that's so, tell us, oh, oh, oh, oh

567
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:20,200
You got it, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

568
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:50,200
I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much

569
00:49:50,200 --> 00:50:20,200
I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about hey, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about so much, I'm talking about American, I'm talking about American, I'm talking about American, I

570
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:27,200
So, tell me, just go

571
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:35,200
I feel like I'm not done

572
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,200
You're not done

573
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,200
So, so, so

574
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,200
So, so, so, so, so, so

575
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:49,200
So, so, so, so, so, so

576
00:50:49,200 --> 00:51:00,340
So, so, so, so

577
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:04,200
So, so so.

578
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:04,900
All this year

579
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,540
When Mine, the doll have in disguise

580
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,100
all this time is pretty smooth

581
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,140
as the, Melanie, the Boyd, and Stevie Wonder

582
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,200
Donnie cast a plate, Stevie down

583
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,500
You can ...

584
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,760
UK's Finest, All I On Nam Piance

585
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,840
I hope that's the right pronunciation

586
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:23,080
Maybe when he gets the email that I played him on the show so the PMN

587
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,040
he'll give me the exact pronunciation.

588
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,640
All right, I got to get going here.

589
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,080
God, I wish my wife were here to give me a metro makeover.

590
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,240
My hair looks like total shit.

591
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:39,000
And you know, this is gonna be cameras and all kinds of reporters

592
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,080
in the courtroom today.

593
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:43,480
So that's so, I got to go spend like 45 minutes getting this thing.

594
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,520
This dead cat on my head looking somewhere half decent.

595
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,920
So I'm getting another one of those.

596
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,960
Oh, well, what you said was really good,

597
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,080
but why the Donald Trump hairdo?

598
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,720
And I will, anyway, so I'm back tonight,

599
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,160
flying liquidy split, I hope,

600
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,840
with the staleos airlines, with easy jet.

601
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,320
And tomorrow I will give you a full rundown,

602
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,720
full report on what took place, what happened.

603
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,880
And I know for will actually get,

604
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,400
if we'll get any kind of judgment today,

605
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,080
but certainly within the next 14 days.

606
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,000
So thanks for all the well wishes.

607
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,200
And send me some feedback, adamantcurry.com.

608
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,040
Fuck, I just send it.

609
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,040

610
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:22,880
Will ya?

611
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,720

612
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,640
and reach out to those guys

613
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,120
and see if we can purchase some more space for poor old magic

614
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:29,960
from me.
