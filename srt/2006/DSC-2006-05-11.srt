00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And with a whole big queen.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And a fair deal.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Happy birthday.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
On the show, the new year.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh, my God.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, all this young in my heart.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, my God.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh, crikey.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,480
So, for your Amos, Esperanza sent in by multiple requests, actually, from the Pods

68
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,500
Saben music network.

69
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, me like a direct, yeah.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Definitely, oh, man, she's from New York.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And let me see what's in her bio here.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Ah, Sophia Ramos doesn't just kig that words too puny to describe her concert.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
She's tough and smart.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
A show stopper who toured with a lot of blues up, performing on the main stage.

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Fantastic.

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Available now on the Pods' tape music network.

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And they're the recycled guys again.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah, right on time.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's Thursday once again.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I start the show.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
They come to pick up the bottles and the papers.

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
As of today, you'll be able to purchase this song.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Of course, we have to get in touch with Sophia and make sure that she's cool with it.

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If you're an Australia, they're available as of yesterday.

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
However, that works a little bit time differences.

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah, liking it.

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So, we're slowly opening up the Pods' tape music network to just to start off in the next few weeks.

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Every artist that is played on the daily source code purchase will be made available.

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And of course, then on in, if the artist decides, hey, I want to put up another song

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and make that available for sale as well.

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
No problem. They can do that without any intervention.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's the unlabeled coming to fruition in front of your very eyes.

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let me see.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Why, I'm not going to get in it.

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Any big heavy thing now, because the guys are just pulling up.

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What is this like some kind of date we have?

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And ladies, I should take a picture of this.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So it's these, actually, I got to say these, these garbage guys, these recycled guys are hunky.

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And of course, it's beautiful weather here at the cottage.

101
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So sun is shining.

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So once again, they have no shirts on.

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I can just see all the ladies in the neighborhood peering from behind.

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Peering from behind.

105
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The curtains.

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
All right. Well, that's going on in the background.

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Interesting response to a topic that I didn't expect a lot of response on came into the voice mail numbers.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
At the first one from the UK.

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't know how it's for me.

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's a podcast call.

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
How you doing?

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I think it's okay.

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Just a quick message, Adam.

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's a soundly that this is probably a pretty podcastly history, because I'm living a message.

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I used this the first day of a message ever from course.

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I guess it probably is from a Birmingham County court at the moment.

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And this is a writing ring.

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Of course, I can't actually get in one of the course.

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And finally, I did that.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And I'll get arrested and put in some of the concerns.

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But, um, they like.

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And I wanted to say as well, just a very quick thing.

123
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Um, we're going on to Patricia's earbuds constantly falling out.

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's been a, uh, a source of humor in my podcast over the last few weeks.

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
My wife says you have earbuds.

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And they were constantly dropping out.

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And, uh, she's a dry name notes.

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It really did.

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Uh, I even put something to put in the blog about how to perform there.

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I think, um, in the end, I just went from the board to some decent headphones.

131
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And, uh, can I suggest you do that?

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I actually went to, um, test scheduling.

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Or has to report some to five quit, which has been to the job.

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Anyway, all the best.

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Speak the same.

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Bye.

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So yeah, Paul.

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Um, first of all, thank you.

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
First, uh, calling from court.

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Love it.

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Are you there, uh, working?

142
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Are you there, uh, being prosecuted is the question.

143
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah.

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So these earbuds, they do fall out of Patricia's ears.

145
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
She's a hard time like jamming him in there, which is, of course, totally a design

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
fault on Apple's part.

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I wonder how many other people I've problem with the earbuds.

148
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't think I'll get away with buying your five dollar test go here.

149
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Headphones, though.

150
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Uh, she's my wife is very particular about sound.

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So say, it sounds like crap.

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You sound like shit.

153
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't sound good.

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah.

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And so they may not want to do that.

156
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But of course, what was really interesting is that these earbuds,

157
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
kept, you know, the right one, or I'll turn to the left one and fall out.

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And it would slip right in between their cleavage, which made the whole thing that

159
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
much more interesting to watch as it just happened over and over and over again.

160
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And I, I, I mentioned that, uh, or no, I didn't even say that.

161
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I said hi, guys, when, when addressing my wife's breasts and, and boy, that garnered some response.

162
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Hey, Adam, what's going on? Jack, when Nick of the Sick World podcast,

163
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
out here in Las Vegas, again.

164
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I am listening to a DSC 384 and, uh,

165
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
the guy from a geographic location or whatever the name of that show was,

166
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
just called in, talking about Patricia's boobs and how you refer to them as guys.

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Well, my girlfriend and I do the same thing.

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
She actually took a one step further.

169
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
She actually gave them names and not only are they names,

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
but they're male names.

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And I, if I remember correctly, uh, one of them is even.

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Well, they're dude.

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
If you remember correctly, your wife named her breasts and you forgot?

174
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah, I hope she's not listening.

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah, Hispanic name.

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The other one, however, because they're, you know, unlike most women,

177
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
one is a little bit smaller than the other.

178
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
She calls that one tiny.

179
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What?

180
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah, tiny?

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Dude, do not repeat.

182
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Do not let your wife hear this podcast.

183
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Do not.

184
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I know.

185
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm thinking the same thing.

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay, so I'm going to trouble.

187
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Thanks for everything, Anna.

188
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You're so much trouble, man.

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You're much trouble.

190
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
By the way, Patricia's are perfectly equal, as far as I can tell.

191
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And I've been playing with him for 20 years.

192
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Hey, Adam.

193
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This is, uh, then from Salt Lake.

194
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
No.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What page?

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Your podcast or anything.

197
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm going to crack this plain old banana on me.

198
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I just want to say I love the Bailey source code.

199
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Now, I dig on the Charlie.

200
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Listen to it all the time.

201
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I've been listening for just over a month now.

202
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And absolutely love it.

203
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:24,000
At first time, I heard the breast stinging referred to in the masculine was in one of my favorite

204
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
movies, blazing saddles where Mel Brooks character, the governor, comes over to one of

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
his assistants and reps of the state.

206
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And her cleavage and says, hello, boys.

207
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Keep up the great work.

208
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Love to show.

209
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Bye.

210
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
All right, man.

211
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Thank you very much.

212
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Anyone else who has anything to say about this show?

213
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Mel lines open.

214
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
In New Jersey, 201, 625, 635, 7.

215
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Love that number, by the way.

216
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Just flows.

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The UK numbers little less flowy.

218
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
In London, 020, 7681, 3753.

219
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And we are working on multiple.

220
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Actually, I got a little email exchange with cast blaster.

221
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
My, of course, it'll cast blaster.

222
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's perfect for recording audio comments in combination with the podcast delivery network

223
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
because it can upstream them automatically.

224
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I still think we would need an interface change.

225
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I think what people really want to see is, is a record button and a send to podcast.

226
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You know, it's like record your comment, send it off.

227
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Or maybe a review.

228
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So you can listen to it, of course.

229
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And then send off.

230
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And Mike's worry.

231
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And I think he's right.

232
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
He says, you know, I hope people don't think that with this pod show plus thing that you'll

233
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
be able to actually record comments, you know, like without a microphone.

234
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Hello, Adam, and all the daily source code listeners.

235
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This is Shme from the podcast.

236
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And I am, uh, hold on.

237
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm thrilled, exhilarated, animated, and raptured, adrenalineized, and extremely excited

238
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
to be the newest member of the pod show family.

239
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Whoo!

240
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That's right.

241
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
My wildest dreams are finally coming true.

242
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
If you'd like to come check out my podcast,

243
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
it's sort of like a cross between an audio blog and a variety show.

244
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You tell stories, jokes.

245
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You talk about stuff that I'm into, like music, theater, and any fails that enters my head.

246
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll replay some awesome, positive music.

247
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So come check it out at thenotcast.com.

248
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And before I leave, a huge thank you to Richard, Adam, and everyone at pod show.

249
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You guys are one second.

250
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You're magnificent, impressing, awe-inspiring, majestic, sumptuous, and resplendent.

251
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Once again, the website is thenotcast.com.

252
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And remember, thenotcast is so worrying, you'll not off.

253
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Hey, hey, who wrote this?

254
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That's a kind of promo, I like.

255
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
We signed another boring show.

256
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Fantastic.

257
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You'll not write off.

258
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Welcome Shme.

259
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Very happy to have you aboard.

260
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Um, and we got a couple more new additions coming up in the next few weeks here on, uh,

261
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
the podcast.

262
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And that worked the pod show podcast network, so you'll be here more of these cool promos.

263
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Also a new pod final.

264
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Hi, Adam, this is Paula.

265
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And this is Alana, and we're a mom writer, talk radio.

266
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Who knew that we would be a part of the seed biggest highest quality pod network on the web?

267
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's pod show.

268
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
This is just so exciting.

269
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I know.

270
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Maybe we should tell them a little about the show.

271
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You think?

272
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I mean, the name, mom writer, talk radio, does kind of tell what we do.

273
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Don't you think?

274
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Well, yeah.

275
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But we want the people out there to know that we aren't just mom to talk about their writing,

276
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
though we both could, since we are both publishers.

277
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I guess you're right.

278
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So we should probably mention our interviews with published mom authors, like,

279
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Declaration of Charge.

280
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, we probably should.

281
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We should also mention that we discussed what it takes to be a writing mom.

282
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Sort of like, mom writer and Hollywood actress Brenda Straff.

283
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah, you're probably right.

284
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But should we mention what we do with the kids while we record the show?

285
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Now that, we probably shouldn't mention it.

286
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah!

287
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah!

288
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yeah!

289
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Check out mom writers, talk radio every week for interviews with awesome mom authors, such as Jacking

290
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Charge, and writing discussion, and much, much more.

291
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
This claimer.

292
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
No kids were harmed during the recording of this trauma.

293
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Except when my daughter threw a card or brother.

294
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But she wouldn't have done that anyway.

295
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
All right, ladies.

296
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Thank you.

297
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And welcome.

298
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Mom writers.

299
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah.

300
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You know, that seems like it could be a very complex job to be a mom writer.

301
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Be at home, have the kids thrown crap at each other and trying to write,

302
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
ooh, definitely only doing it in nap times and when they're nursery school, I presume.

303
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So that brings me to an update about my mom.

304
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yesterday, we were awaiting the results of another scan that she did.

305
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And unfortunately, the news is not good.

306
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
She has cancer in her lung, which is a real bummer if you only have one left because the previous one

307
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
was removed due to cancer.

308
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
There's also also spread a bit onto her ribs.

309
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So, even though this news was a shock to all of us.

310
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It, we were prepared, I think.

311
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Certainly, my mom was ready.

312
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You know, she's every single time she's been back to the hospital for something.

313
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
After everything was cleared up, then there was another bit of bad news.

314
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So it's interesting time, very interesting time for us as a family.

315
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
My sister has flown in from Italy this morning.

316
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
She's going to be there through Sunday.

317
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
My other sister, of course, lives in the Netherlands.

318
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And we're going to go out and have some fun.

319
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
My mom has a little shack where she used to go regularly on weekends.

320
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And so we've reopened that.

321
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So we'll go hang out.

322
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It'll be the kids and mom and Bob.

323
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And I'm sure that's going to be, you know, fun at the same time.

324
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You know, it's like there's really only one topic of conversation.

325
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And either we're talking about it or we're not talking about it and thinking about it.

326
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Or joking about it, which works too.

327
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And it would be a hell of a lot easier for everyone, particularly my mom.

328
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
If she didn't have, you know, if she wasn't in pain, that's the equality of life is what it just sucks.

329
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So there's lots of things to think about and decisions to make and directions to go.

330
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And as the doctors have said, you know, there's no reason to give up hope.

331
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And that, of course, is I'm not one to do that ever.

332
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So whatever, you know, direction my mom wants to go in, we'll go.

333
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You know, whatever doctors she wants to see.

334
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
If it's all, if I got to get some witch doctor from the deepest jungles, we can do that too.

335
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
If she just wants to pursue a better quality of life with the, you know, better pain management.

336
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Whatever it is, we'll do.

337
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So it's going to be a funky, funky mother's day.

338
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Very funky mother's day for us.

339
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And you know what, I'll just say, and I appreciate so much all the wonderful thoughts and emails that you guys have been sending me over the past.

340
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What is it now? You're in a half that we've been going through this.

341
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But you don't have to do it every single time.

342
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You know, it's, believe me, it's okay. I really appreciate.

343
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Just think of her, send her positive vibes and thoughts and that'll be cool.

344
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So it's not the totally bum you out.

345
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I thought I'd read out this little story, which, you know, is one of these joke emails that circulated.

346
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's about having mom over for dinner and I thought it was so funny because this is totally something my mom could have done.

347
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And you're like it, I think.

348
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So Brian invited his mother over for dinner during the course of the meal.

349
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Brian's mother couldn't help but keep noticing how beautiful Brian's roommate Stephanie was.

350
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Brian's mom had been suspicious of a relationship between Brian and Stephanie and this had only made her more curious over the course of the evening.

351
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Well, watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between Brian and Stephanie than met the eye.

352
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Reading his mom's thoughts, Brian volunteered, you know, I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, Stephanie and I would just roommates.

353
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,000
But a week later, Stephanie came to Brian saying, you know, ever since your mom came over to dinner, I've been unable to find the beautiful silver gravy ladle.

354
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You don't suppose she took it, do you?

355
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Brian said, well, I doubt it, but I'll all send her an email just to be sure.

356
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So he sat down and wrote, dear mom, I'm not saying that you did take the gravy ladle from the house.

357
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm not saying you did not take the gravy ladle, but the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.

358
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Love Brian.

359
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Several days later, Brian received an email back from his mom that read, dear son, I'm not saying that you do sleep with Stephanie.

360
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm not saying that you do not sleep with Stephanie, but the fact remains that if Stephanie was sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the gravy ladle.

361
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Bye for now, love mom.

362
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Never try and lie to your mom, I guess that's the, that's what we learned from that one.

363
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Jeff Tinnan, Tinian, excuse me, sent me an email and I, you know, for a second there, I thought you might be right, hello Adam.

364
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I have a theory about Rogers absence of late, we're talking about Roger Smalls, of course.

365
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I actually think he's got himself a girlfriend, and that's why he hasn't been in touch.

366
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I have so many friends who had some point in other have gone quiet after bagging a new squeeze.

367
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Leave it a month, I'm sure he'll be back in touch once the novelty is worn off, all the best from Jeff.

368
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And say, excuse me, I know that's disgusting, but I just needed to do that.

369
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Well Jeff, funny enough, I think that your theory may be true because it has been almost exactly one month since we last heard from him.

370
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I have been Roger here, I'm so sorry to not sending you any recordings for a while, but I was very upset by comic suit blogger's siblings, he too was me in crayon on his website.

371
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Now, I'm not sure why I hate his gun going like him, as the rats call me ugly.

372
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I know I'm not actually buried head for anything when it comes to looks, but let's just talk into some girls that go out drinking and go fed,

373
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
and he won't know how in the trash if I am.

374
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Now, I've decided to do the same thing that he does, and demand a public apology from him, because I think as long as he's got a hole at his ass,

375
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
he's going to continue to be spite-loom-boots people, which I don't think is any way to get on in life.

376
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's all I've got to say now at him, I'm not saying another word until he issues neurology.

377
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So, by for now, Roger.

378
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And while he's at it, he can apologize to Russell B.T, he managed wine scene, and everyone else on your comments board too, because he's a nasty piece of work.

379
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
By the way, will you stop talking about that blessing computer game?

380
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm sure it's heavy-working, sat down and talked about space invaders for half an hour, then he's losing all his audience.

381
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Now, when the people think podcasting is key key, the reason people listen to your show is to hear how much pets your life is compared to theirs,

382
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
not to talk about dungeons and dragons and high schools.

383
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So I am so angry, I should go, I just thought someone should help you, goodbye.

384
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Oh, Roger.

385
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You say me, my brother?

386
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Okay, so I do take this seriously.

387
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It sounds like you're angry at comic strip blogger.

388
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Now, I think he actually, I think he's been pretty nice.

389
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,000
He's said that he's given me advice to do things, to help you out, you know, send you money so you could get on second life.

390
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Excuse me, I need to say the virtual world, second life, where I am sometimes to be found at the curry castle.

391
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Anyway, it's good to hear your voice, that's for sure.

392
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Let us know if it was a girlfriend that distracted you, but if it was really just comic strip blogger that made you so mad,

393
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I think we need to sit down and talk.

394
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And you know what, Roger, I would love to get you into the second life virtual world, because I think that you and comic strip blogger,

395
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
maybe you guys could meet on neutral ground, you know, meet over at my place, and let's talk this out, okay?

396
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Because I don't like that.

397
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You're the original stalker.

398
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm sorry.

399
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's just what I call it.

400
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's a term of endearment.

401
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You're the original stalker.

402
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And please, Roger.

403
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Please come back.

404
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Now, what was it, Roger was saying at the very end there?

405
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Hold on a second.

406
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Let me just see what was that he was saying about me.

407
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:01,000
That's what people want to listen to.

408
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Well, it's funny because I received a comment.

409
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I see it received a comment about me and my success.

410
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Hey, Adam, it's PDF from Love House Radio and interview with a stranger in thedaddycast.com.

411
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And of course, Love House Radio on Second Life.

412
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You know, I think I figured out a couple of keys to your success.

413
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And one is that you like to push the limits on anything.

414
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And it's to learn how to overcome obstacles.

415
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
So use Gmail as an example.

416
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
There's a four gig limit.

417
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Somehow you've gotten to open it up to more.

418
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So actually, there's a two gig limit.

419
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And I was able to open it up to four for myself.

420
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm not supposed to talk about it because I used various back channels to make that happen.

421
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
That was, well, also I used this show to make that happen just by begging for it.

422
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And of course, now, you know, I'd love to go back to the trough because I've been deleting stuff every single day for the past.

423
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And I don't know, three months.

424
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You know, so I'm deleting stuff from 2005, which I really hate doing.

425
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I don't know if it was death threats from the pod father or what.

426
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I've been in second life.

427
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
No, no, no.

428
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's just an awesome board of directors is what that is.

429
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm down with it two days.

430
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
There's a $150 limit until you're 45 days old.

431
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
But you partnered with the right people.

432
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You created groups.

433
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You gained more land.

434
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I mean, you've ever came that obstacle.

435
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I have a little surprise in that question why you didn't go the option of buying an island.

436
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I don't know if it's, you know, because potions of building third life or what the thought was.

437
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
But I'm thinking you could even use a little relation in it.

438
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You could have the pod show peninsula.

439
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You could have the curry countryside.

440
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You could work all these things plus you'd sell off lots like it was nothing.

441
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I mean, everybody would just kind of follow along with currently residing around the castle.

442
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
But anyway, I'm definitely entertaining and impressed with your focus and drive.

443
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And come on down to the love house.

444
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
We're only two to go down from the cat.

445
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Oops.

446
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Looks like you got cut off there.

447
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Yeah, you know, first of all, I love seeing PD love in the virtual world second second life.

448
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Because we actually, you know, we particularly early in the morning US time, which is afternoon here on East Coast,

449
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
at least, you know, we actually have pretty meaningful conversations.

450
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
They're short, but it's like having a quick little ICU chat and we sit around in the circle and we took on the ball.

451
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And if you want to hear more about that and you're listening to this podcast on Syria Stars 102,

452
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
you'll have to download the show at dailysourcecode.com tonight.

453
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
We should have a new digital flotsom.

454
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
If it's the one that I heard just the other day, you're going to love it.

455
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You're going to love it to bits.

456
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Michael Butler will close up the evening with some pod safe tunes.

457
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And up next, we have Mark Yoshimode Nemkoff and the hell coast, the hell way players.

458
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm sorry, with the PCH on 102.

459
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And I just wanted to continue on that one thought because that is actually something that is,

460
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I think pretty interesting to talk about from a business case.

461
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
You've probably seen this woman, and she chung, or you've heard of her.

462
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
She's this girl who has made a small fortune.

463
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I think it's valued like $250,000 on doing just what you mentioned, PD love.

464
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
By buying up virtual land and then creating something there,

465
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
reason that people will want to be there and buy land from you,

466
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
which of course raises the prices.

467
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And if there's any game element to this virtual world,

468
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
it is that, it is making money on buying and selling land,

469
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
which I'm so completely not interested in.

470
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I just do not give a crap about that.

471
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And also, there you go, PD.

472
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I'm looking ahead because there's some changes coming that are going to drastically change

473
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
what this particular virtual world is and what makes it tick.

474
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And that is the use of teleports.

475
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Now, of course, in real life, it would be nice if I could just sit here and say,

476
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
you know what?

477
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'm going to pop over to the Pod Show HQ San Francisco office and just stand in the teleport

478
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
like Star Trek and be there.

479
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
So unfortunately, that's, well, although experiments are being done,

480
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I don't think they've done it on humans yet.

481
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
In second life, the virtual world, my wife makes me say that.

482
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
That is possible.

483
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
However, the restriction currently has been up to 300 meters within the same

484
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
sim, the same simulator, which is basically if you buy an island,

485
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
then you have your own simulator.

486
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And so you've never been able to go from, say, from island to island through a teleport.

487
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
But when this teleport feature gets included, well, then all of a sudden,

488
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
it won't really matter where you are because people can access you from anywhere.

489
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And it'll, I think it's going to matter about the people that are there,

490
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
the people that you meet, the experiences that you have.

491
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I was talking to, I was a Jeff Smith, Jeff Smith, Kevin Reeves and...

492
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Crap.

493
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Why am I spacing out on this?

494
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Hold on.

495
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Jeff Smith, Kevin Reeves.

496
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Give me the other Nashville guy, William.

497
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Oh, how can I be so stupid, hold on.

498
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
When I, when I figured out, I'm going to go, oh, duh, of course.

499
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Here it is.

500
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Matthew Ebo.

501
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Duh.

502
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Okay.

503
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
How could I forget?

504
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Right.

505
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
So they're planning, and I'm not, I'm not quite sure what they're doing,

506
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,000
but they're planning on a US Podsafe showcase, and they're going to do a little tour.

507
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And so I thought, well, you know, when we open up this other place that I've been building in the virtual world,

508
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
called the Podsho Palace, maybe their first, you know, their first dry run could be doing it in second life.

509
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And I'm talking to some short, you know, each 15 minutes sets or something.

510
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And it would, um, it would get a lot of people acquainted with, uh, with their music.

511
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Uh, you'd meet other people who listen to podcasts, and maybe some maybe we'll have like,

512
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
oh, I'd love to have Don and Drew, uh, in our VIP area, do a meet and greet.

513
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It sounds, you know, tin foil hatty and all that, but, uh, you actually will be chatting with Don and Drew,

514
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
and you actually will be listening to the live music of Matthew Ebo, Kevin Reeves and Jeff Smith.

515
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And Jeff, I got a killer piano for you, man. I know you're into the crazy piano stuff.

516
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So just a thought, um, and that's the kind of stuff that I believe will, will keep this exciting.

517
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
So that's what I'm doing with Brittany.

518
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I have two women in my life. It's fantastic.

519
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Okay.

520
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Speaking of, uh, when am I done here with this, um,

521
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Wait a minute, I'm a little confused. Ah, here we go. This is what I was looking for.

522
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Hey Adam, this is KFC from podcheck.com inviting you to join us at a pagan wedding

523
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,000
in the stones at Stonehenge on our summer solstice coming up June 21st at sunrise.

524
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It's sure to be a fantastic event. I understand Patricia is also a witch.

525
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Um, not real clear on all of the different pagan witch dialects. I don't know how that works,

526
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:13,000
but our misdemeanor podcheck from 2005 is a witch is getting married at Stonehenge in the stones at sunrise

527
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
on the summer solstice. So I will be over there the week of that wedding,

528
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
hand fasting, whatever, and was a wondering if I might be able to meet up and see you,

529
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
perhaps get a tour of curry cottage or something fascinating like that.

530
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And be, see if you might be interested in attending such an event and being involved.

531
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Sounds like something really neat and fun and exciting.

532
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So I offer that up to you. Please let me know.

533
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
All right. My contact information is podcheck.com.

534
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
KFC at podcheck.com. Um, so I look forward to hearing back from you.

535
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Right. Hope you're having a fan tabulous day.

536
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Make them smile.

537
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Yes.

538
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
You know, if you've never checked out podcheck,

539
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
she's a member of the podshow podcast network.

540
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It's some awesome stuff.

541
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Some great videos like naked women parachuting, like really cute naked women parachuting.

542
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I didn't, I didn't see any naked guys parachuting.

543
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Otherwise, I think it would make it even better, or at least entertaining for all sexes.

544
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And I, you know what, I thought that Stonehenge was for the druids and not for witches.

545
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And I say Patricia's a witch, but you know, she's not an official one.

546
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Not with any clan.

547
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Although I, I have suspected her flying the broomstick once in a while.

548
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
So she's very in touch with with nature and all that groovy stuff.

549
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And she talks to the animals.

550
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
They talk back and she understands it and all that stuff.

551
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Um, so yeah, maybe we'll hook up at Stonehenge.

552
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
But I have to say, I don't do tours of the cottage.

553
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I've got to have one place in my life.

554
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Just one.

555
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Despite the occasional paparazzi, just one place where I can be completely safe.

556
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Yeah, I'm longtime listener for Minneapolis.

557
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You know what, before I get to that, just on the marriage thing, Alex Foucombi, Foucomb.

558
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Uh, sent me an email.

559
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
He said, uh, according to what I heard on Delta Sierra Charlie 382,

560
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
you had a hard time proving that you're married to your wife.

561
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Well, I mean, I have the paperwork.

562
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It's just not officially signed.

563
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
And so he's suggest, why don't you get married to her again?

564
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And you could confirm your vows this way.

565
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I guess all you need is a chapel with City Hall or a courthouse.

566
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Well, why don't you get wed in second life?

567
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Dude, go listen to that episode again.

568
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And then tell me you think my wife is actually going to do that.

569
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Time in.

570
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I just heard the earthquake promo again on your show.

571
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And I want to please let you know that I've gone to the earthquake website.

572
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
At least twice, possibly even three times to see if earthquake is available in my area.

573
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'm in the market for looking for DSL, table service.

574
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And with the problems I've had with my local table provider.

575
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Blocking 48, so I can't do web servers on my system.

576
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I wanted to see if great points would do the company for me.

577
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I was wondering if there's a way to change this advertising 2.0 model

578
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
to let very point know that I'm a DSC listener.

579
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And I've already got a relationship with them.

580
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I've got a relationship with the early source code.

581
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I know you I trust you.

582
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You've recommended earthquakes.

583
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And now I know and trust Earthlink.

584
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And I was wondering if there was a way to express a back door or something like that.

585
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So that I've never, I hadn't, haven't given everything to my email address for the contact.

586
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
But if I knew, they're going to treat me different because I'm a DSC listener.

587
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I want to give them my email address.

588
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Anyway, keep up the good words.

589
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Love the show.

590
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Okay, so I do appreciate what you're saying and that you want to be my back door man.

591
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
But of course it would be wrong if they treated you any different from any other customer just because you're a DSC listener.

592
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
However, there is a way that you can show your appreciation.

593
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And this is something that's kicking off in, well, very shortly.

594
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
In fact, you know what I can do.

595
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I can, all right, I'll let you hear something.

596
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It hasn't been officially approved by Earthlink yet.

597
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So subject to change, et cetera, bloody, bloody, bloody, bloody, blah.

598
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And just take it at face value.

599
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
But I just want you to hear this.

600
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And this is only for the listeners of the Charlie.

601
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Because there will be a way for you to express that.

602
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
In fact, you could do it very, very artistically.

603
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
So just between us, guys, right, under the no damn announcements rule,

604
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
you didn't actually hear this.

605
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
You stick of advertising that sounds like, well, advertising.

606
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Maximum strength relief to buy current insurance.

607
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Fast as selling diet tell.

608
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Did you ever wonder who writes those jingles that make your head explode?

609
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Do you think that you can do better?

610
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Well, if that sounds like you, then come on down.

611
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Howdy and hello.

Real cash payment?

626
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
That's right, Marty.

627
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000

And real cash payment?

633
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
That's right, Marty.

634
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So what about us?

635
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Well, if the spots are good enough, then we'll be rendered obsolete.

636
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Absolutely.

637
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
That's right, Marty.

638
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Just one challenge in advertising as we know it could cease to exist,

639
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
opening the world to a new and better form of communication

640
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
that would be more entertaining, informative, and even accurate.

641
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
That's right, Marty.

642
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
That sucks.

643
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
That's right, Marty.

644
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Think advertising sucks.

645
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So do we.

646
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000

Dayfox.

657
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I just want to suck it.

658
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Those balls are so big.

659
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Unbelievable.

660
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Okay, so you didn't hear that.

661
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And please, yeah, stop.

662
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Stop with Firefox.

663
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Go into adchallenge.potshow.com.

664
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's not up yet.

665
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Okay, stop it already.

666
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
You didn't hear one single word of what just happened.

667
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Okay?

668
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Hey, Adam.

669
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
This is Jeff Hines with the Friday Night Dance Party podcast.

670
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And you know, summers coming up soon.

671
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
And we don't have a theme yet for summer of 2006.

672
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So I selected three songs from the Pot Saved Music Network.

673
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
And I thought, might represent the theme for summer of 2006.

674
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And I'm going to be playing them every week on my podcast for

675
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Friday Night Dance Party until June 21st.

676
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
To see which one is voted theme of summer of 2006.

677
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Selection number one.

678
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
You can do them about the weather, my friends.

679
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
So make the most of it around the expected hot weekend.

680
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
That was summertime course only by Little D.

681
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000

682
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Summer time by Brother Love.

683
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Nice play.

684
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
In selection number three.

685
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
The guy said it's sunny here.

686
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
We've been waiting for the side here.

687
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
The sun is up.

688
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000

00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
In selection number three.

691
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
The guy said it's sunny here.

692
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
We've been waiting for the side here.

693
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
The sun is up.

694
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
This guy's up here.

695
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
This summer.

696
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
This summer.

697
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
That was this summer by spoil sport.

698
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Like in that.

699
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
So you can go to Friday Night DanceParty.com to cast your vote.

700
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And podcasters play these songs.

701
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Let everyone know that we're going to be moving and grooving for a theme for summer of 2006.

702
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And this is Jeff Hines with the Friday Night Dance Party podcast.

703
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Alright Jeff, great idea man.

704
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I really appreciate that.

705
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
That's cool.

706
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I like that last one.

707
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Man, the cowbell just fits so nicely.

708
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Alright.

709
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
When the pod father promises the pod father delivers.

710
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Simon James.

711
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Originally from the UK now living at Barney Beach, Australia.

712
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
It begins with a hundred violence play.

713
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
No one said you can be heard.

714
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Somewhere in the summer.

715
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
The music carries on.

716
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
The world's begin to say.

717
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
With everything going on.

718
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
My life.

719
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You know that.

720
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
She goes to his job.

721
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:57,000
She rolls and has drowned.

722
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

723
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
She's always coming up.

724
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
With all this crazy stuff.

725
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And you just can't let it go.

726
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
She's breaking all the rules.

727
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
The people here.

728
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
She's a one step ahead of the game.

729
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
But just when you think.

730
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
She's got no more tricks.

731
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
She'll knock you over backwards again.

732
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
With everything going on.

733
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I was real in my life.

734
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
You know that.

735
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
She goes to his job.

736
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:52,000
She rolls and has drowned.

737
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

738
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
She goes to his job.

739
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
She goes to his job.

740
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
She goes to his job.

741
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
She goes to his job.

742
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
She goes to his job.

743
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
She goes to his job.

744
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
She goes to his job.

745
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
She goes to his job.

746
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
She goes to his job.

747
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
She goes to his job.

748
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
She goes to his job.

749
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
She goes to his job.

750
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
She goes to his job.

751
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000

752
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
She goes to his job.

753
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
She goes to his job.

755
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
She goes to his job.

756
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
She goes to his job.

757
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
She goes to his job.

758
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
She goes to his job.

759
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
She goes to his job.

760
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
She goes to his job.

761
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
She goes to his job.

762
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
She goes to his job.

763
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:20,000
She goes to his job.

764
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Simon James, the pod save music network on your daily source code today,

765
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
buy it on the pod save music network tomorrow.

766
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Or yesterday, if you're in Australia, very cool.

767
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Of course, links in the show notes, which you can find at daily source code.com.

768
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I also cross post that on curry.com.

769
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Yeah, it's actually in the file itself.

770
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
If you look on your iPod or your I River, you should be able to see them.

771
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Okay, a couple of things just before I go.

772
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
People been asking me, why does my mic sound so good all of a sudden?

773
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
What did I change?

774
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Nothing.

775
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Well, actually, I did change one thing.

776
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I finally got a plot filter, which, of course,

777
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
the power of my power of my piece,

778
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
the potential power of my piece,

779
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
still is plopping a little bit.

780
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
But what it is, made me do is I'm talking a little bit further away from the microphone,

781
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
just because I can't close mic at the way I used to.

782
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Because you know it, and that's, you know, I like being close to the shaft.

783
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Ladies, you know what I'm saying?

784
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
It's a, it's a Freudian thing, no doubt.

785
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
So maybe that's it.

786
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Maybe I was just completely overloading the microphone,

787
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
but everyone seems to love it.

788
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
So it's nice and crisp and sound good.

789
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I'm talking more over it, actually.

790
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
This is the high LPR40 for those of you that are interested.

791
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And I did a little bit of tweaking on the TLA 5052 stereo valve process.

792
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
But otherwise, I did absolutely nothing.

793
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
No change whatsoever.

794
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
