6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The following is an actual pod star conversation.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
May 1st 2006.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Pod star emergency.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is Adam.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm still going to stop late.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And the guy we're currently coming next to me is listening to corporate radio

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So loud.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I can't hear my favorite pod cast.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Okay sir, try not to panic.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I've just called in an air strike from the pod father.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Bad things happen to people who listen to bad radio.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Is everything all right now sir?

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes, yes.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Thank you.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Oh, bless you.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Pod star.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Tell us where bad radio lives.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And we'll make sure it's gone.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This name is Adam Curry.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000

And go ahead.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Vision.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Glory.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The old song.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Dog there.

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
He was 16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Fantastic.

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000

I'm flying into the future.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm flying into the future.

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm flying into the future.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm flying into the future.

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I didn't have a way to say

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Been attached to a hole

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
From all we have a surprise

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's ready to settle down

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Maybe get some kids in the wild

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And it's a lie

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
When it wins, can we rise?

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
There's a way to write

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What's in this life?

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
When it wins, can we rise?

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000

I'll be the one, I'll be the one

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'll be the one, I'll be the one

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's time to miss me

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
There's a way to write

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
When it wins, can we rise?

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000

Good

It's a way to write

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's important

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I want to give you a review of last night

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
John Collins

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And evening with John Collins

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I've got to tell you, thoroughly and press

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
We had a great time

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It was about an hour south, an hour's drive south of here in lots of them

125
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Which is very famous, very nice acquaintance

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,560
historic. Look really good. And we didn't mind driving for an hour and we had, you know,

127
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,960
it's always fun, just the two of us. And oh, man, isn't nice that our daughter can now kind of

128
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,680
hold down the fort alone. For those of you who are parents who have reached that stage where

129
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,880
you trust your kid to stay home and not let, you know, murderers and rapists in and not burn

130
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,080
down the house. You know what I'm talking about. We had forgotten. Now, first of all, this theater,

131
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,360
the Guild Hall, it probably holds about, I don't know, maybe four or five hundred people.

132
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,840
I don't think there were more than 200 people there. So it was nice and cozy, nice, small

133
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,680
intimate atmosphere. We had forgotten to mention yesterday that opening up for Joan Collins was the

134
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,840
infamous quartet who perform every Friday night on Jonathan Ross's talk show here in the UK,

135
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,960
which is, uh, I think a great show and it's a, it's a big hit. It sends sail, everybody.

136
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,320
Um, they're called forpuffs in a piano. And it's exactly what it sounds like forpuffs in a piano.

137
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,840
And I hope we don't have to get into explaining what the word puff means in the UK.

138
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,040
And they always have these great comedic skits and they have little jingle-like songs kind of,

139
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,520
I'd have to say, uh, in a way they're kind of like Jeff Smith, uh, although I think Jeff is

140
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,680
musically better and certainly sings better. Uh, but they have, you know, cool little lyrics and

141
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,400
little, uh, little fun things for every guest that comes on. And they opened up and it was

142
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:51,920
fantastic. We laughed our ass off. You know, if you're, if you're, if you're no that kind of, uh, a gay comedic review

143
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,520
type stuff, then you would have really loved it. Um, and it was, these guys were really sweet, you know,

144
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,600
after they're done like 45 minutes set. They said, okay, we'll be in the foyer. You can buy our CD,

145
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,360
which, uh, we still have 15,000 copies of, no one ever bought it. And I understand why, because of course

146
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,960
he went into the foyer. We bought their CD. They were, you know, handling the money themselves.

147
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,360
It's just amazing. It goes to show, you know, you think these guys are on TV every single week

148
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,680
on a huge show and, and they're really grovelin to make ends meet. Um, uh, and Patricia immediately

149
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,440
jumped. Oh, I want to picture with these guys. So snap to pick you. Probably have already seen that

150
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,400
on curry.com. If not, check it out. It's, uh, four poofs in a Patricia is what I, uh, titled the

151
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,360
picture. We listened to the CD on the way home. Oh, so disappointing. Actually, I bought both

152
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,440
their CDs at a Christmas CD and whatever their other CD was. None of it was any of the comedic

153
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:46,080
skits. It was all like, you know, real gay party songs. You know, YMCA, I will survive and really

154
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,960
poorly produced and just the crap, total crap, which is unfortunate because there's so funny

155
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:58,400
on stage. And then it was time. The diva herself came out, Joan Collins. Now, um, let me set the stage

156
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,240
foyer. So we're only like four rows of weight. It was almost like a high school play. This is how

157
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,920
this, this, this, this, this theater was, it was situated built. And, you know, probably if I spit

158
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,680
hard enough, like I could have reached her, her shoes, mine I add, by the way, Joan Collins has

159
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:20,480
I mean, awesome, awesome looking shoes, really nice shoes, just something I wanted to say. The whole

160
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,560
outfit, the whole woman is, she does have a nice, a very nice persona. Oh, or I, I've always enjoyed.

161
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,720
And she's 70 by now. She never gives reveals her age, but she's about 70 Patricia has, uh, it

162
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:40,080
on reliable information. These old broads, you know. So what it was is essentially kind of a

163
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:47,520
multi-media walk through her career. Huge screen of three different sets on stage. So a classic

164
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,560
chair, a telephone set, you know, just little props that she could walk to to complete the story.

165
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,760
And start soft, of course, with, you know, with dynasty. And then she walks on stage and,

166
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,480
uh, big needle scratch, stop the dynasty. There's a lot more. And it's really interesting because

167
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,720
this is something that you see with celebrities a lot. People who've become famous for, or really

168
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,360
super ultra famous for one thing, uh, but have really have a huge body of work behind them.

169
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,800
And actually after that, the stuff that they became famous for. So of course, we all know

170
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,720
Joan Collins from Dynasty, but man, she, she's done a lot of stuff. She's been in some super

171
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,320
huge movies, theatrical productions, television shows, and some really crap stuff. And she made

172
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,400
a great fun of herself. Now, the thing that really pissed me off. Within 30 seconds of her walking

173
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,120
on stage, I leaned over to Patricia and I said, her wireless mic is going to crap out. I can hear it

174
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,120
right now. It's an antenna positioning. I don't know what it is. And sure enough, within like a minute,

175
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,160
every single time she sat on the chair, the audio would cut out. Now, here's what's on

176
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,760
forts. So first of all, that really breaks your concentration when you're listening to someone

177
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,280
under into the story. But she is approaching this very much from an actress point of view. It's all

178
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:10,080
scripted. Um, the everything she says is consistent. I'm sure, uh, the, uh, the pictures and videos

179
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:16,640
are triggered by someone offstage, clearly, uh, to go along with the story. So whenever, you know,

180
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,520
if the mic cut out and, and I was happening to me, I would have broken the script and I would have

181
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,320
done something and made sure that that got fixed. So throughout the entire hour and 15 hour and

182
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,320
20 minutes, there were at least five or six moments where you could just, you cringe because all

183
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,240
sudden, then all you hear is her voice. And by the way, she still projects very well, but it just

184
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:41,200
sucks, sucks, sucks. I would, I want to kill the audio guy. That was such a bummer. Um, but good,

185
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,400
it was really entertaining and it was fun to learn about. She had some great stories about

186
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:55,040
Elizabeth Taylor, uh, about, uh, you know, the Swiftie Lazar, her longtime agent, uh, just about the

187
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,360
Hollywood days of old and his fantastic to listen to. And I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoyed myself.

188
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,840
I had a great time. And I know Patricia did too. And on the way home, it was, uh, we had a great

189
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:11,360
drive back, uh, except for, you know, when I skimmed through all 13 of the gay disco tracks from the

190
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:18,160
four post of the piano, I was just sucked. And then I threw out my 145 classics. And we just kind

191
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,760
of cruise on still with the, uh, with the vibe in the memory of, of Joan Collins's story. It was really,

192
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,720
it was cool. I have, I have to say. It's nothing that I don't think, uh, it's something that could

193
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:36,560
make it to, uh, to a London stage, or to, uh, you know, or Broadway. It's definitely not that quality.

194
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,800
And also, she should be triggering the, the, the events herself, kind of like the weatherman that

195
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,080
would have made it much easier. If, if I were producing it, uh, but it was good. So we enjoyed it.

196
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,040
And it was funny because when I got home, we were home around 1130. Uh, I, I teleported into the, uh,

197
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,680
into the, uh, into the castle. Um, now when I teleport into the castle, people can't see me, but I can

198
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,360
still hear them. And I was literally hearing the campground out front people saying, yeah,

199
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,600
I wonder how Joan Collins was. So it was a little too late for me to get into the whole, uh,

200
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:10,560
whole review last night. So I teleported out. And, uh, yeah, good times, good times. If, if you have a

201
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,240
chance, I think they have 10 more dates if you're in the UK. And by the way, Portsmouth nice,

202
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,240
very nice. I think we should go back there during the day and see what Portsmouth has to offer.

203
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:27,360
Lots of, uh, voicemail coming in responses, uh, appreciate your use of the phone lines in Jersey 2016256357

204
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,840
in the UK in London, O2O76813753. And then just pour it in.

205
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,240
Hey, Adam, this is George Ramchino, man. Hey, there are these two guys who are working

206
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,680
in the prison laundry. And they say your hair wasn't as cool as Ricky Rackman. So I stabbed

207
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,200
them in the exercise yard with a knife by me from a spoon handle. Hey, just one man,

208
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,520
there were a couple of new guys on a said block. And one of them kind of looks like you.

209
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,400
And from behind, if you know what I mean, he lets me stroke his hair, which is nice because

210
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,160
it reminds me of the chop chop. And man, you know what's crazy? No, he's thinker.

211
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,000
Look, he's just like her loader. Uh-oh. Oh, man, I got to go. I think one of those very

212
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,200
innation guys just bought me for a carton of lucky strikes. I'd better go do my stretchy so

213
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:22,080
I don't pull a hammy. I'll catch you later, man. Mr. chop chop. Peace out.

214
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,120
Oh, yes, our friends from prison. Glad that we're making a difference for you guys

215
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,120
on the inside. Incoming subs-based. We have to.

216
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,400
Hey, everyone. Hey, Adam. This is Rev Tim from the Rev Tim podcast.

217
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,080
My second annual Mother's Day Special is coming out right around the corner. And I

218
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,440
wanted to give a shout out to all the source code listeners because I believe that the source code

219
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,360
has one of the largest audiences, as well as some of the most diverse people around the world.

220
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,920
What a great audience that you have. I love to hear all your comments all the time. But the

221
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:17,120
second annual Mother's Day Special, I need your audience, Adam, if you could ask them to put together

222
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,800
a very special show that will actually go on the Rev Tim podcast. And here's what I need.

223
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:30,480
I need people to email me audio comments to Rev Tim podcast at jmail.com. That's Rev Tim podcast all

224
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:40,560
one word at jmail.com or just pick up a telephone and call area code 815 301-8600. That's the

225
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,080
godcast.org audio comment line. And we're going to put together a very, very special Mother's Day

226
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:52,240
program at the Rev Tim podcast. Hey, you guys have a wonderful day. Adam, say hi to the family,

227
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,680
yo Patricia, yo Christina, and yo to the back garden. Hey, you guys have a good time. And Adam,

228
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,920
one of these days when you're in the Bay Area, hey, look me up. I'll buy you a cup of coffee and we'll

229
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:12,720
hang for a while. Take care and God bless. Rev Tim, everybody. Of course, celebrations for Mother's Day,

230
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:19,200
only US, only I believe, as we've already had Mother's Day here in the UK. I celebrated on US

231
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,920
time for my mom. I'm going to go see your Saturday again, by the way. She's doing much better. She

232
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:30,960
actually went to my sister's son's birthday party, which meant like a 45-minute car trip. Of course,

233
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,560
Bob drove her. And she's feeling good. Her buddy Gloria came over for she lives in Pennsylvania.

234
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:41,040
And she stayed for a couple days. And so the spirit is there. And that's what that's what really

235
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:47,360
really counts and makes a difference. And so I'll see if I can whip something up. She's, you know,

236
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,960
my mom doesn't really listen to podcasts. I got her the, you know, the groovy laptop,

237
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,640
which she uses all the time. But I don't know, she, I don't think she wants to make time to listen

238
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:04,480
to podcasts. By the way, you know, fantastic comments for Patricia. People really loved yesterday's show.

239
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,600
What was interesting? Well, two points really. One is that just about every single comment that

240
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:16,960
came in about second life was on Patricia's side, which is interesting because I still see it a

241
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,560
little bit differently. I even got friends of mine saying, hey, man, you've got to watch yourself.

242
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,280
You know, you're going to get sucked in and we don't want to lose you. I think it makes a difference

243
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,320
if you have a purpose. You know, if you're just in there to either fight or have sex or walk around

244
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,960
and stuff, yeah, you can get lost. But still, you know, what difference, if you're giving up your

245
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,280
television time, if you'd normally watch TV for an hour and a half or two hours, this is totally

246
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,760
better than that. You know, you write your own script. The script goes as it goes along as you do.

247
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,680
You just have to be able to unplug people get addicted to TV, too. So I'm with you on that. And too

248
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,480
much of anything, obviously, is never going to be good. But now I got to tell you, I've been sending

249
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,080
these, you know, Patricia has never been into computers or the internet until I set up the the

250
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,480
I, the G5, I'm back in the kitchen. And now I catch her all the time, man. She's like reading

251
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,880
comments. She's doing email. And yesterday, she actually let, uh, she actually let a piece of

252
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,400
chicken burn because she was preoccupied with stuff other than what she normally would do. So we

253
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,800
got to keep our eye on her, too. You know what I'm saying? I add them. This is Susie calling from

254
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,160
Dublin in Ireland. I just wanted to say how great it was to hear Patricia on the show today. When I

255
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,840
first heard that she was going to be on the show and I went, oh, thanks. There will be no talk

256
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:38,640
about second life then. And wrong I was. But then. Oh, I got to, I love that. You were just

257
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,720
like the lucky charm, Leprechaun when you said it. Oh, goody. They'll be no talk about second life then.

258
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,400
But we know talk about second life then. And wrong I was. But then I agreed with most of us

259
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,080
Patricia was saying. So that's it. We off no end. And I really enjoyed listening to the show

260
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:00,480
that I look forward to the other information about podcasts and things like that. And I really

261
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,800
get me into listening to why it's for I see a podcast. Anyway, keep Patricia coming on the show

262
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:14,080
was a guest and really enjoy it. And I have information as I try some stuff which I was sent to

263
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,920
Patricia by email. That's okay. All right, then take care. Bye. Thank you very much, last love it very

264
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,280
much. Yeah, lots of people sending in arthritis information. That's cool Patricia just said,

265
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,240
if I took everyone's advice said, I wouldn't have to eat food anymore. Just be in pills and

266
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,400
other stuff and remedies. But she's going to try it. You know, as I said, she's in touch with

267
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,880
herself and touch with nature. She is a white witch. So she'll evaluate it. You know, my mom

268
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,000
actually said that she should carry two chestnuts in her pocket. Apparently that works too. But

269
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,200
there is no sure fire remedy. That's one thing that is definitely for sure. So I do have to hit you

270
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,240
with a little bit of second life talk because it is a part of my first life no matter what you say.

271
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,640
Michelle Bellasky sent a Gmail to me. He says, you know, I don't know if there were others who

272
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,880
bumbleed upon your neighbor's yards and a quest to find yours. But I know that at least I did and

273
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,560
I want to apologize. It was certainly nothing malicious intended. It was simply a matter of not

274
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,880
being able to fly very well yet and also not very clear on how to get my bearings in the world.

275
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,320
Quite simply, I got lost. I ended up on your neighbor's patio. Someone came out, asked me what I was

276
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,040
looking for. They told me how to get there and I was on my way after perfuse apologies. The problem

277
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,080
came in by the fact that they were having sex at the time I popped in. I really feel bad.

278
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,240
Initially, I thought it was quite brilliant of you that people had to fly to your place for the

279
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,320
landmark where they get deposited, quite fitting. But then you have people like me who don't know

280
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,240
how to fly so well, I want to say all I know is that for any future parties you may have there,

281
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,000
I remarked the landmark to indicate the front door spots. So I'll never again appear on any

282
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,240
neighbor's doorsteps. Well, we're going to move any future parties which are going to be

283
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,640
structured. It's great to be hanging out and I really like it. It's cool to just drop in. It's a

284
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,920
way for me to communicate with people who listen to the show. Listeners podcasts, there's a

285
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:06,720
like, but it's bad for the neighborhood. What is the podcast? Is that building next to me

286
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,880
really from the podcast pickle guys? How obnoxious is that thing, man? Don't.

287
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,040
So the pod show palace coming along quite nicely, quite nicely. In fact, I'm looking for

288
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:27,520
scriptures and animators. So this is real life stuff. I'm looking for scriptures and animators

289
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,760
who can help out with this project that I'm working on, which I think will fit seamlessly

290
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,520
into what we're doing in real life and podcast. And it'll just give us an extra dimension.

291
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,200
You know, not trying to hook you on crack or anything, but it could happen. So if you're

292
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,920
and you know, think, what is it to machine him up? Is that what they call it? You know,

293
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,960
where you create videos from second life? Think that. Think about, you know, great animations.

294
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,440
Think about, you know, scriptures who, and I've looked at the scripting language for second life.

295
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,320
It seems, it doesn't actually seem all that rich. You know, there's some, there's some good

296
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,720
stuff in there, but could do with a lot more. But if you're interested, fire off an email to pod show

297
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,920
palace at gmail.com. So scriptures and animators experience in second life, please, only, and send

298
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:20,240
it off to pod show palace at gmail.com. Yeah, I'm sorry. I haven't been by the castle, but then

299
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,480
too busy between my two pod cast and the show I have coming up to really hang out in the old

300
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:34,480
SL, but I did drop by really briefly the other day. And two guys were in there wearing their

301
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,880
matching pod show shirts and jeans and put tops in the same hairdo. And one of them asked me,

302
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:48,480
oh, are you Adam's mistress? The one who doesn't play the cello? So I don't know,

303
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:57,520
I'm weird. I was like, yeah, I guess it looks like I am. Anyway, hopefully I don't know next week.

304
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,560
Angie, what are you saying? Are you my mistress now all of a sudden?

305
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,920
I didn't know you played the cello, secretly. So there you'll be able to see you again, but I

306
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:13,600
did want to mention that I found out about how to get audio into the game. I can use my nice

307
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:21,600
cast to bring a stream in. So I could either DJ or sing or whatever else. And you could

308
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:28,320
DJ too over at the castle. So just have something to do with using nice cast or whatever else to

309
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,600
get into your little audio service in the doodle. So I'm sure you can ask around and find out very

310
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,960
quickly how to do that. Well, have a good rest of the week. Thanks, Angie.

311
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,520
Sidelight listeners on serious 102 daily source code.com to hear the rest of this show. You've got

312
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,440
Pacifico's Tell My Next and Digital Flotsom later on as we continue here on the Charlie.

313
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,000
See, was it something else? I didn't want to say anything else about second life I was done.

314
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,520
I'm trying to keep it to a minimum. You know, just based upon the feedback that I got,

315
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,680
a lot of you just really don't care. That's cool. You don't have to. I guess I can treat it just

316
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:08,480
like flying. You know, a lot of you don't care about me flying either. I did receive some interesting

317
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,880
videos, though. And there's just just stuff there. The stuff that we can do. The stuff that

318
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,320
will totally carry over into into our real life that I think will be extremely cool as we

319
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,720
start to connect all these pieces together. I was made aware of the fact just two days ago,

320
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,800
right here on the daily source code that it is national may is national masturbation month

321
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:37,360
and go figure. Wouldn't our buddy Jess Smith just love to hook into that?

322
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
Here we go.

323
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:38,160
Thank you, if you haven't been so naughty, I'd never want to thank you, but naughty naughty

324
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:46,400
one day. I really have to say we've been so bloody naughty. Thank you, sweet today, boy.

325
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,600
Here we go. A naughty naughty monkey. I really have to thank you. If you haven't been so naughty,

326
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,480
I'd never have to thank you. A naughty naughty monkey. I really have to say,

327
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:06,880
if there's a naughty naughty monkey. Yes, the fabulous Jess Smith available for wedding

328
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:14,320
smart mix was and a spankin. And actually for some good-ass tunes, the Jeff Smith dot com,

329
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:20,720
that's G-E-O-F-F, the Jeff Smith dot com. He can also do all kinds of stuff for your show

330
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,400
if you're a podcast or if you're interested. Here's something interesting that I got. This came

331
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:30,160
through on, not sure if this came through on the voice mail line or not, but first time a candidate

332
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:36,160
has actually called into the judge. Hello Adam Curry. This is David Martin and team of Texas.

333
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,760
And listen to the podcast for a long time. Work it on a good audio comment for you.

334
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,000
It might be kind of lengthy. I don't know if you'll play it or not. There were a whole bunch of topics

335
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,520
that you could talk about. You want to know a little bit about me, go to votes for the number four

336
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,280
David Martin dot org and learn about my campaign. Take over says, they're old.

337
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,720
I kind of want to be like the comic strip blogger who makes me laugh every time I hear it. Thanks

338
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,920
Adam. Wow. Now that would be a candidate I would vote for. If comic strip blogger were to run.

339
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,240
For European Parliament, no less. Oh, wouldn't that shake things up? Wouldn't it be fantastic?

340
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,960
Yeah, I should think about endorsing a candidate for elections for any elections anywhere.

341
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,400
You know, everything makes so much difference. Anything that, in one sneeze anywhere in the world

342
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,200
is felt everywhere else. Hey, where's Roger Smalls by the way? I haven't heard from him in weeks.

343
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,320
I'm a little bit worried. He didn't show up at the draft in darts. I haven't heard anything from him.

344
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:35,840
I hope he's okay. Roger, if you're listening, not just myself, but lots of people miss you, my friend.

345
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:44,640
For sure. I was going to say, oh, yeah. I was I was actually contemplating getting into the

346
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,120
discussion about Iran. I was listening to the BBC this morning. I just switched back and forth

347
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,560
between radio four and BBC London, actually, which I think I like better, which is more local

348
00:28:54,560 --> 00:29:01,440
and has kind of more real people on it. At least that's my opinion. And so there's a lot of

349
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,400
rumbling now in the UN about Iran, not complying with the, uh, what is it? Is it a resolution they

350
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,360
have to comply with regarding, uh, using nuclear energy for safe purposes and not for weapons

351
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:20,160
of mass destruction? Of course, the Iranian government or the, uh, is it the Ayatola?

352
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,560
Has said some pretty funky things in the past. So it's stuff is heating up and it does concern me

353
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,480
a little bit when I listen to it because I think the UN is totally useless. I don't think it makes any,

354
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:37,680
I don't think they can do anything for anybody, uh, but the IAEA is at the International, uh, atomic,

355
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,240
something, association, you know, the guys who check on nuclear stuff, they have some checklist that

356
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,920
Iran has to comply to and apparently they don't. So now you hear all this stuff about you

357
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:55,360
a new, you know, security council resolution and that force could be used. And it's just like,

358
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,960
am I just dreaming or is this deja vu or what the hell is going on? If you haven't

359
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,600
opinion about it, I would like to hear, um, because sometimes it's important to talk about that

360
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,400
stuff as well. You hear so much of it that you become almost immune and numb and then you can,

361
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,200
you think you just, and you don't know what's true or it's not true. It's being spun or isn't

362
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,840
being spun. I guess I'm going to have to go and delve deep into some web logs. He's

363
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,640
I can find some truth in those, but it's, it's, it's complicated and I have to be honest. It really

364
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:32,800
does worry me. And now we're from Ashfinter. It's the Yanks versus the Brits. We'll drive each other crazy,

365
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:38,800
but everybody knows that it's a parent to see. They're just like you and me. It's the Yanks.

366
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,920
And the Brits. The Yanks versus the Brits. Mind the gap.

367
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:53,280
Hi Adam. This is Kristen from Metropolitan Detroit, Michigan. And I'm also known as your neighbor,

368
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:59,200
Gabrielle Reo in second life. I own a lot next year, currently vacant lot, and comics and

369
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:05,440
yours lot, also known as comics your blogger. Anyway, I've been a loyal DSC listener for about

370
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,360
seven months, and I'd honestly never considered contributing feedback of any kind until

371
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:18,480
your Yanks versus the Brits segment of DSC number 378. I just have to respond to Glenn from the

372
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,480
Zed A show's comments about Americans. Not all of us are ignorant about the world outside of our

373
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,160
borders. Nor are we all running around wildly in a nationalist observer with the belief that

374
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,760
if it is an American, then it's not good enough. Just as Glenn feels annoyed by the stereotype

375
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,200
that he's encountered being a South African, I'm just as bothered by the American stereotypes

376
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,960
that he mentioned. It sounds like Glenn has encountered Americans to display qualities such as

377
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:54,240
ignorance or intense nationalism, so I don't want to invalidate his experiences. I just want to

378
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,960
state that these are qualities that you can find everywhere and in every culture. Yes, every culture

379
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,040
has its quirks and idiocying crises, and we Americans certainly have quite a few, and so

380
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:12,160
to the Brits. There are many of us that have lived outside of the United States or who have

381
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:18,720
family outside of the United States, and therefore we have a wider world view. I just felt the need

382
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:25,760
to speak up for this segment of Americans. So thanks for giving me this opportunity for feedback

383
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:31,600
and thanks to you and all the podcasters out there. I believe that you're all pioneers in

384
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,200
something amazing and I'm glad to be a part of it as a listener. So cheers to both the Americans

385
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,080
from the Brits and I'll see you in second life, neighbor. Yeah, neighbor. Open up your parcel to

386
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:48,800
me neighbor so I can drop by unexpectedly when you're having sex. I'm loving this. Yanks versus

387
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:56,720
the Brits stuff because this is, we got tons of stuff coming in. Peter had this enormous story which

388
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,640
I really want to set up properly, so I'll do that maybe tomorrow on next week's show. Keep

389
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,240
them coming in though. And if you have the opportunity to send them in as an audio comment,

390
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,520
pre-recorded, please do because obviously it sounds a lot better than these phone calls,

391
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,280
but at least we're getting listeners like Gabrielle and I'm really appreciative of it.

392
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:19,520
And there is some learning to be done here about why these differences exist and where they come from

393
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:26,960
and I'm always interested in the in the history of things such as why do Brits say Z and Z? I'm sorry,

394
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:35,840
crap, I set it up wrong. Why do Brits say Z when Americans say, when yanks say Z? Well,

395
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:42,960
pay attention kids. Hey, Adam and Bruce Murray from the Z cast as Z cast dot com. As you can tell

396
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,240
from the name of my show, I have a particular interest in the last letter of the alphabet.

397
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,880
You know what's one of the wonderful things about being Canadian is that we enjoy the best of

398
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:59,040
both worlds when it comes to the yanks and the Brits. I mean, we have close ties with our common

399
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:06,000
wealth brothers in the UK, but we still enjoy many of the wonderful traits of our friends and

400
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,240
neighbors to the south. But as to the alphabetical dilemma of why does the rest of the English

401
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:20,320
speaking world say Z and only the American say Z? Well, that's simple. They changed it to rhyme in the song.

402
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:38,000
Get your cowbell out. A B C B E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z. It just doesn't rhyme. So they

403
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,640
changed it to rhyme in the song. But the rest of the world still uses the original Z. I mean,

404
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:52,480
you would drive a Jaguar ZX, right? And of course, in Canada, we listen to ZZ Talk. Oh,

405
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:59,920
well, not really. I mean, most people think that Canadians say A, but but we don't. We say Z.

406
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:11,600
Anyway, you can check out the Z cast at ZEDCST dot com or in the United States ZEDCST.

407
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,240
I haven't quite got into a second life yet, Adam. I'm still trying to figure out the first one.

408
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,440
But I always listen to the Charlie. Take care, Adam. All right, Matt. Thank you.

409
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,920
See, it's working. I like this stuff. If you if you're in the car right now and think,

410
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:35,280
I got to talk about this. You can call me 201-625-6357 or 02076813753 in the UK.

411
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,840
And I only say that because I figured that it's just easier if you write it down.

412
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,880
I know you can pause it and go back, but I just want to put that in there.

413
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:48,240
Playing the cowbell, by the way, is it's kind of hard because I don't have the podcast

414
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,640
Paul gave me this wonderful cowbell off of his own drum kit, which is highly appreciated. I actually

415
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:58,560
should have asked him to sign up to put his signature on it or something. But I treasure it dearly.

416
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,840
What I don't have is a drum stick. I'm currently using a pencil. Adam, chip from top of the

417
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:11,040
pod, saves here. And by the way, I bought the top of the podsafe.com domain for $6.95.

418
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:17,520
So daddy, thank you. Yeah. I'm excited that you have props like the cowbell at your disposal.

419
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,000
And don't take this personally, but you truly do have the rhythm and cadence of a

420
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:29,520
Jersey white boy. I got to have a cowbell, baby. Now, commenting on a recurring thing from the

421
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:34,800
last few shot shots. I think if you're going to cremate yourself, you should then use one of

422
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,360
those leftover cheats and chong papers. And then maybe your friends can light up some curry,

423
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:45,520
but in memorial. You know, they say that THCD stays in one system for a long time, so maybe it

424
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:51,280
will hold out through the cremation process as well. I know it sounds weird. Hey, but it's better

425
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:57,520
than the use wet socks that chong used, right? Well, that's all I got to say. Loving the show,

426
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:05,120
keep it up, and one more for you. And then I got to go. I got a fever. And the only prescription is

427
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:11,680
more cowbell. Yeah, baby. I try, man. I try sometimes I get it, right? Sometimes they're one of

428
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:19,840
this podsafe music is just off beat. That's also possible. Yeah. Yeah. We were talking about that.

429
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,720
When I die, I definitely want to be cremated. That makes a lot of sense. It don't take up any space

430
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:31,360
for me. And the original suggestion was to put me into tattooing, and tattoo me on the

431
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,040
Madge's ass. But I like this better. You know, just have a whole bunch of friends come over and

432
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,960
smoke me. Yeah, I think that would work. Hey, Adam, it's Matthew Ebel. You're going to be turned into a

433
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:48,000
tattoo on Madge Weinstein's ass? No. I don't think so. To quote Dennis Larry, we're going to have

434
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,800
to wait till you die, and then smoke your ashes. Okay? Because considering how, well, most of us,

435
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,440
you know, pretty much know by now how you end every show. And probably begin every morning,

436
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,800
and maybe a little bit lunch too. I'm pretty sure we'll be getting a good buzz off of that.

437
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,840
So yeah, no. Save it, please. Don't, don't, don't waste it by, you know,

438
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,680
by turning into a tattoo on somebody's ass. Because that's just, you know, that's really an unpleasant

439
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:21,920
thought to begin with. So this one's for you. Well, I can't bring my lighter to the day job.

440
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,320
So just imagine a clicking sound. Tutal. Matt Tutal. Matthew is so sweet. He sent me a lovely email.

441
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,400
He posted something similar on curry.com regarding the second life conversation the

442
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,080
Patricia and I had yesterday. He said, you know, dude, I really don't want to lose you as a friend.

443
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:41,760
Don't get sucked in. The stuff is bad. Mojo, he's lost friends that way. He used to hang out with

444
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:48,080
and doing important things like eat pizza, barbecue, and smoked up. I lost a lot there, Matthew.

445
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,080
But it would not be cool. Of course, we don't know what's happened. What comes out in the

446
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:58,800
afterlife, but it would be interesting to just see all my buddies sitting around smoking me.

447
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,760
That would be kind of cool. Let's see. What else did I have? Oh, I wanted to roll this out for you.

448
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,320
Since he's been doing such tremendous work and always is there to help me out

449
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:15,680
and comes up with all these fantastic creative ideas. A little bit of props for Jeff Smith, who is

450
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:21,200
being propped all over the place these days. And rightly so. Hey Adam, this is Russell from the Raising

451
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:29,040
Giants podcast. My latest show is up number 25 and it's an interview with Jeff Smith. That's

452
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:36,880
right. Lee Jeff Smith, who created the Metro section moment, Trinity. And most recently, the Raising

453
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,520
Giants podcast theme. You can check out the show over at Raising Giants.com. That's

454
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:52,240
a Raising with an RAZ and hope you enjoy it. Take easy out of this guy. Jeff Smith has such

455
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,040
hokey stuff. I like it. And could you believe that accent that he does on the Yanks versus the Brits?

456
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,480
I think it's really good. I mean, I'm no expert. I thought it was really really good. Okay,

457
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,640
two geeky items before I get out of your hair for today. Of course, I want you to send in your

458
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,480
kick-ass music for tomorrow's Friday festivities. The thank God it's Friday edition of the

459
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,840
Daily Source Colors. We wrap up another week. And of course, I'll try and get the Lady Patricia on the

460
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:20,480
show. This comes from our time, Crop, a Dutch listener. And here's a, he sent a link. I don't think

461
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:27,360
he sent a link. Crap. Well, anyway, open street map project is going to free the Isle of White.

462
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:32,080
Now, the Isle of White is to the south of of Gilford, almost straight down south. Actually,

463
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,240
very near Portsmouth, as I said earlier in the show. Only takes about 20 minutes, 25 minutes to

464
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:42,000
fly to be over the island itself. This coming weekend, the open street map project is gathering on

465
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,600
the Isle of White off the south of the UK armed with their GPS devices. This band of some 30

466
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:53,200
plus enthusiastic amateurs planned to map the whole of the island, demonstrating how easy it is to

467
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,640
create copyright-free maps and not have to be at the mercy of commercial organizations like the

468
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,240
ordinance survey with their insanely high fees, not familiar with that, by the way. All collected

469
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,320
data will be available on a creative comments. Clearly, the more people turn up, the better the

470
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:13,360
results will be. So one last push for getting more to come along is going on. Usually excited about

471
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:20,800
this. This is from Simon says, I guess. So I'd love to help. If I can, you know, I could certainly

472
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,520
take the Delta share up Sunday. I don't know exactly what you want me to do. I could do some

473
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:32,160
aerial photography. I have a GPS. I could save my track. I mean, I don't know how to help. I'm just

474
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:38,560
not sure what is needed, but if you need air coverage, I'm here for you guys, for sure. Okay,

475
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,400
one last geeky bit. Hi, Adam. I got my golden ticket today and I've been playing our own

476
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,840
pod show plus. I didn't see any links on the site for feedback. Okay, so let me just tell you that

477
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:55,120
we have the devcast.devcast.podshow.com. Another episode coming up. And if you subscribe to that

478
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:00,880
show, you have a large relatively large chance of getting a golden ticket, which gets you in now,

479
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,480
where we're helping the developers help us essentially. And so that's what he's referring to.

480
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,680
So we finally got his goal to take it and his end and is looking for place to provide feedback.

481
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,080
The developers want beta feedback and bug reports. If so, where should we send them?

482
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,600
One other thing, what have you done with the commester blogger? Hold on one second.

483
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:23,680
We had started a source forage project to do just that. And source forage says that within

484
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,000
two business days, it'll approve your project and turn it around. And it's been like five or six days.

485
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,640
But K1 is on that and Andrew Grummer on that and just keep your eye on the devcast

486
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,280
show site as well as developer.podshow.com. Okay, now what was your question about

487
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,920
commester blogger? Recently he's been so nice and I sort of missed the abrasive old CSV.

488
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,840
This is where I call you Mr. Adam fucking curry. But I don't think I get pulled off of the same

489
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:54,400
gusto as a commester blogger. So thanks Adam. This is Jeff Bear from Craft Beer Radio.

490
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,920
You can find the show at www.craftbeerradio.com. Yeah, you know it's interesting you say that because

491
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,840
you know people like commester blogger. I really like that when people push back and particularly

492
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:13,760
the way he has done in the past. And it I like getting inside people's heads and trying to

493
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,680
see if I can tool with them and turn it into something positive. And actually I think commester blogger

494
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,120
has delivered a lot of you know a lot has contributed quite a bit to the show. I also miss a bit

495
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:27,760
of the abrasiveness. He sent in an audio comment for Patricia about second life which sees

496
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,800
me I'm not going to use because I don't want to subject my the lady Patricia to you that in

497
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:39,120
that manner specifically. But feel free to abuse me a little bit more. And if you don't want to

498
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:45,200
then you don't and actually you know how shit he's going to get all pumped off now because I said

499
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:51,920
that he was abusing me you don't know whatever whatever I got it I understand okay Jeff one more

500
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,120
thing there hi out of that shit did I miss it all what was the last thing you said. Anyway

501
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,640
I guess it's time for me to go what are we at 43 minutes perfect okay so if you want your

502
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:10,720
domain name for only $6.95 as you heard earlier just go to godaddy.com and upon check out

503
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:16,320
use the promotional code dsc3 and you get that domain name for $6.95. Ports of the show brought to

504
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:21,040
you by earthlink and of course we have the pod show challenge coming up very soon where you can

505
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,000
win valuable cash and prizes and have a hell of a lot of fun creating stuff as we are working

506
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,400
with earthlink on that and and that'll start off in the next few weeks and of course you're

507
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:37,760
really responsible for this because of the outcry of protest almost against the earthlink commercials

508
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:43,040
that have been running across the pod show network so you're going to get your chance to change

509
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,160
that help us change advertising because that's really the next phase of where we have to go.

510
00:44:51,760 --> 00:45:00,480
I'm I'm that's it I'm done I'm empty I've nothing left I'll see you right here for the
