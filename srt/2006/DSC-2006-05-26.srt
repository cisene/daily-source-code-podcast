00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Think Advertising sucks.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Think you can do better?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Diltess Yara Charley.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Three.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Nineer.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Four.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Sixty million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
They pack the bags and off they go.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Though they might be quite far from home.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The world is their oyster and she is his pearl for sure.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's Patricia and Adam set out for another world tour.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
New Yorker's San Fran without her just wouldn't be right.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes, she's the real reason for Adam to come home tonight.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But when they're away and they both want to play at the flick of the wrist or up on the split

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
they can find their way around.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Paint the whole town for sure.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's Patricia and Adam set out for another fabulous wonderful

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
filled extravagant happy ever after world tour.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And coming to you from northern California Monterey.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Pebble Beach to be exact.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It is the daily source code for Friday.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Good morning.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It says still very early on this Friday morning out here.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
She can tell from the nasal sound.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This is not going to be a typical Friday show.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We've been here at the Cliner Perkins CEO Summit for the past two days.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And there's plenty to talk about, which I think we'll probably do a nice Memorial Day weekend show

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
with the two of us at the condo and really get you ramped up on many of the amazing things

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
that we've witnessed once again.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But a lot of all the people who are here, one person really stood out on the first evening

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
so that was when we get here, huh?

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't know.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Wednesday, Wednesday evening after a very long flight from New York and an equally interesting

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and long car trip from San Francisco Airport down to Monterey.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
There was a dinner and so the dinner features all of the CEOs.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's who was invited here, all the CEOs that Cliner Perkins has invested in companies

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and the spouses if they choose to bring them.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But there was a special guest, which was announced who would be our entertainment for the evening.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And this special guest did probably about an hour and a half of what at first brush may have looked like

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
stand up, but it really was something completely different.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
His name is Charles Flycher and if that name doesn't mean anything to you right off the bat,

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
if you, and I'll put a picture of him up in the show notes on dailysourcecode.com and curry.com.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He also was, he's an actor, he's a scientist and most of you will probably know him as the voice of

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
a many other characters, Roger Rabbit and who framed Roger Rabbit.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And I was just mesmerized by what this guy was doing and what he was actually doing with the audience and how incredibly intelligent he had to be

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
to be able to make all of these different observations and make it all very funny.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So we hooked up actually not long after his performance and I said, I really want to get you on the daily sourcecode

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,000
because I think you were 100% podcast material and not just audio video and over the course of the past two days

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
we've actually come to some agreements, this would be a very good thing to try.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And for today's Friday edition, which you can just chill out and listen to over Saturday or Sunday,

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
it's about 40 minutes.

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I talk with Charles Flycher around midnight last night in the ballroom I think of the hotel.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We tried to find a relatively quiet place.

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And I'm going to let you listen to that now and I'll be back at the end of the interview.

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I think you'll see that this guy is definitely interesting, certainly entertaining and without a doubt wacky.

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So when I came in late last night and you were already performing.

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
How long...

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You were now when I started?

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No, no, no, because we came in late and then Ron sent me in it.

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
First of all, I didn't know that you were here.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I was like, join us for some great entertainment and for our guests and I'm like, God, it's Robin Williams.

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Let's see here too.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No, no, but they do a lot.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He invests with the client of Perkins.

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Really?

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yeah.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And they keep saying, you know, it's like they got Bono and they got Oprah.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And so they have this Hollywood side scene.

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So it's a tie-in.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Exactly.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So it was like, you know, a special guest.

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And I'm like, because I knew that Charlie Rose originally...

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Right.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Well, I guess he does this all the time.

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But he had some heart sugars.

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's what he said.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's what he said.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's what he said.

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's what he said.

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's what he said.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's what he said.

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But what was amazing is that...

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So I came in late and I'm sitting at the table.

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't know most of the people here.

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I know Ray and John and the people at our table.

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And I think a lot of people would say, well, that was a great stand-up comedian.

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Wasn't he funny?

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But I'm like, this dude is something else.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You were doing shit on stage and I'd never seen before.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Of course, I've been deprived maybe of a lot of light on entertainment.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But you've done research and you were just doing shit on the fly that was amazing.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Totally blew me away.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh, well, that's my goal is to create new synapses.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And many people realized stuff that they didn't realize they realized.

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
When did you hear about doing this particular gig?

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Well, they first told me about it a couple of months ago.

102
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I was booked.

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So you did have a while to prep for?

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh, no.

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I didn't get the book with everybody's name in it until just yesterday.

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I did it for yesterday.

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I got it.

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I looked through the book before I did the show and just kind of,

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
because in my act, I usually work the crowd.

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What do you do?

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And then I worked that all into bits that are cohesive and leads to songs at the end.

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But everybody here, you know what they do?

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So I focused more on the idea of the names of the corporations they have.

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So you were planning on doing that before the year?

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Well, I have figured to be something about that because some of the names just seem really cool.

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Like a spatial photonics.

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
A little spatial photonics.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That was cool.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And someone just seemed really kind of lame and good technology.

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Even though it is good and you know, know now.

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah, I hadn't heard of it.

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I hadn't heard of it.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
One true media and I'd heard of it.

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah, I heard that this is pretty cool.

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's kind of like a random.

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah, they got some kind of app that does stuff and matches a video.

127
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yeah, it's totally, it's basically like a real time editing thing.

128
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
They just, you know, so it takes the first picture in it.

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Well, from a group of different random possibilities, it will zoom into the left.

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And then the second picture will flash cut.

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, really? Okay.

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And I haven't seen it.

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's just what I...

134
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It really incubates in terms of rating about it.

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
He uses it for something.

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And apparently, you know, it will change that.

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Just like on, there's certain, I use Mac, I would guess.

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But they still have screen servers.

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And you can have it going around and where it picks from this one in that one.

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And you get the Ken Burns effect.

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The Ken Burns effect.

142
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Is that it? The Ken Burns effect?

143
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Well, that's the silver.

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I think it's more like, you know, Ken Burns himself.

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's more the George Burns effect.

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Ken Burns ripped me off with his Gracie Shadow Grace.

147
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You know, so I sat down and like, I know this guy.

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Of course, everyone has that with you.

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yeah, I know this guy.

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm very mad about it.

151
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't think you want everybody.

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Because everybody likes you.

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You're probably doing something wrong.

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You want some people to be offended and some people not to get it.

155
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's good to be.

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't think anyone is completely like.

157
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I mean, you know, nobody likes Elvis or nobody like the Beatles.

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah, even Jesus, not as an icon.

159
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You know, it's impossible not even like selections.

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So a lot of people know you from who frame Roger Rabbit,

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
which I just realized that movie, although it seemed so incredibly fresh.

162
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And memory was 18 years ago when I came out in 1988.

163
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah.

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's 18 years ago.

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah.

166
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Man.

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Isn't it 18 or 15?

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's 17.

169
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I just know it was longer than it was in high school.

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah.

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It doesn't seem, I don't calculate.

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So like, to me, I kind of just consider it's always now.

173
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Right.

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah.

175
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That was Roger.

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So did you two other voices in that?

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Three.

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay.

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Good call.

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Twenty seconds.

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Cool.

182
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There was a question on jeopardy ones, I think.

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Like regarding that.

184
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I was Benny the cab.

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Right.

186
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And two of the wizards.

187
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's like on greasy.

188
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
greasy.

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Right.

190
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Did you see?

191
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I want to kill him.

192
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm kidding.

193
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah.

194
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Do you consider yourself actor, comedian, observer of people?

195
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I consider myself to be many different things.

196
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And all related to my central self.

197
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And all of my career people have advised me that I needed to just pick one to which I responded.

198
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You know, I have to limit the things I love to do because you have a small brain.

199
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You've been going slim.

200
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
An agent, obviously.

201
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm not even.

202
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Sometimes they were just, you know, presidents.

203
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You know, so I looked at just before I came out of the room.

204
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I looked at, I think it was Wikipedia or something incredibly authoritative source.

205
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's an amazing amount of shit that you've done.

206
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Lots of TV.

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah.

208
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And then off that basis, you know, I've been doing this for a while.

209
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So if you make living for a while, you're going to get some kind of credit score.

210
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Mm-hmm.

211
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And the irony, I guess, is that I feel now that I'm in a position now.

212
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm really bad to like start doing things on another level.

213
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And then all of a sudden you bump into the podcast guys.

214
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Podcast guys, which is interesting in many ways because maybe three days ago,

215
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
there was a big article about you guys in the LA paper.

216
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah, the LA Times.

217
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah, the Times.

218
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yeah, which I had read.

219
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And I sometimes pretty interesting.

220
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Again, I just, I was reading that I was thinking, like somewhere in Martha Quinn is going,

221
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Whoa.

222
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What's that?

223
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
How did you do that?

224
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Wow.

225
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I got the new Trajina here.

226
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
She's sitting there going.

227
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Can I have a cafe, coffee, coffee, and going back to France and around?

228
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
All those people.

229
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Well, this is actually, this is our second company.

230
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
We took a company public in 1996.

231
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah, I would have some like large coin above.

232
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yeah.

233
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
They just made it.

234
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I think having money, or even with a calm business, the fuck you money,

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
which is not necessarily means that you can say fuck you,

236
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
but it's certainly possibilities.

237
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And which is like, do this?

238
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
No.

239
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Because if you have no money, I'm saying fuck you.

240
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You're saying, I really rather not.

241
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What's that an instruction?

242
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's an instruction or proposition based on predestination.

243
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah, that's, I think that's really, I think it's cool.

244
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Especially when you do it on your own ideology in terms.

245
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
On terms, and you still have your dignity in.

246
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's not like, you know, you did Chinese gay porn.

247
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
There was a fluffer for pandas.

248
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Which pays really good.

249
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Just a taste of pandas.

250
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's like it's actually a day.

251
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
If we're sitting there running, I go like, this is a podcast.

252
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
He's a podcast.

253
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And we've been doing this now.

254
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I've been doing podcasts for almost two years.

255
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And for the first year, I kept on saying, where are the, where are the comedians?

256
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Where are the, the wordsmiths?

257
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You know, this is so perfect for them.

258
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And you're the first one that actually bumped into,

259
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
switched on and understands and is interested in it.

260
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah.

261
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It seems like that's, that's, everyone who can do that.

262
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You know, the stuff that you do.

263
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Just really fast, very well thought out.

264
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Brilliant.

265
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's not all comedy, but it's just, it makes you sit there and think for a couple seconds.

266
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't know where they are, but then I do, and they're not, they're not thinking about that.

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
A lot of times they have an adversity to the technological ability,

268
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
which prevents the sensitivity from manifesting proclivity.

269
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And because I am, as you said, indeed the word wise,

270
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
but I also love bits and bytes and technology.

271
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And I think it's having that understanding of essentially an evolution of medium,

272
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
which leads to large, which makes the small one.

273
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It makes the one all depending on the position point of view

274
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and how many pandas have recently allocated.

275
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Are you not a point in, in your career, your life,

276
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
where you're ready to do something more experimental,

277
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
or less, let's call it less mainstream?

278
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I've always been there.

279
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I mean, I always consider everything.

280
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't really consider that modality as affecting me.

281
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I mean, if I get a job going to movie, I'm doing that,

282
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
but I just, as the role kind of said,

283
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
listen to the beat of a different drummer,

284
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I've always just kind of followed my own instincts.

285
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And if it sticks fine, if not, I'll just, you know,

286
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
put it on the shelf and just keep making stuff.

287
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But I definitely, when I read about it,

288
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and then talking to you, realize that this, you know,

289
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
it's like meeting a girl that, you know,

290
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
you really like just realize that this works.

291
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I get this, or reading a book that you really like,

292
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
or the first time I saw Salvador Dali,

293
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
his paintings, personally, or the first time I heard Hendrix.

294
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's just a connection where there's a resonation

295
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and your soul and just kind of go,

296
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
yeah, or someone, you know, gets you,

297
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
and there's just like,

298
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
have you heard the raccoon tours?

299
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I know that new album, I think, Jack White.

300
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Really great.

301
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I think it's, and I like plugging other people

302
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
who are especially when they don't need it.

303
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Because they're doing really well.

304
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But when you hear something that's new,

305
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
and you just immediately go, yeah.

306
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And it's the same kind of thing about this whole dynamic,

307
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
podcast thing.

308
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's also a vibe of the people too.

309
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You know, you know, you wouldn't even partner

310
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
or you think it's just, there's a,

311
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
like a raccoon tours, there's a rock and roll,

312
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
kind of sensibility.

313
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's just, it's an ideology of dealing with things.

314
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's different than other business modes.

315
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What we notice, what we discovered is that,

316
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
the easiest thing is to compare it to,

317
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
particularly the audio is to compare it to radio,

318
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
which isn't a very fair comparison.

319
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But when people hear podcasts,

320
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
they, they all of a sudden,

321
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and they realize how deprived they've been

322
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
of quality audio entertainment,

323
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
particularly from the radio.

324
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah, everything is, you know,

325
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
it's a formatted package sliced down totally solos.

326
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
To be like the last thing that was successful,

327
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
you know, a bunch of guys in the morning.

328
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah.

329
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Good morning.

330
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's a wacky morning zoo.

331
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What do you think is old?

332
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh, the new.

333
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's really pretty predictable.

334
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah.

335
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And it's, you know, it's television without the lights.

336
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And the real radio, the old stuff was really cool

337
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
because it, really the imagination,

338
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
take over, you know,

339
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
you know, we're in a room,

340
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
because the room we're in right now is,

341
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
like, about three inches of grip jelly on the floor

342
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and at least large,

343
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't know, they look like bugs.

344
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
They're just kind of bouncing around the background

345
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
and these chairs are floating,

346
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
they're just weird chandeliers.

347
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
They're kind of like breasts,

348
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
but then again,

349
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
more like,

350
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
just candles that are flared outwards.

351
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And that's the room.

352
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
No, everybody,

353
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
here's that,

354
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
we'll get a different variation of it.

355
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And someone's going to go,

356
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I know that room, man.

357
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
They,

358
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Tina, they're in the jelly room.

359
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I told you, it's real.

360
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Oh, Frank, you're tripping.

361
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
No, baby.

362
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's the jelly room.

363
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
These dudes are in a prank you're tripping.

364
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
No, baby.

365
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So we've talked about,

366
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
about some ideas and some stuff that you might do

367
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
with podcasting.

368
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
How would you want to utilize this?

369
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I want to do a show

370
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
that incorporates my,

371
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
my loves,

372
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
essentially,

373
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
which are the arts and science,

374
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
including everything from music

375
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
to literature to painting,

376
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
to the ability of humans to figure out

377
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
how the universe works.

378
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
If we were talking about that,

379
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
the golden ratio,

380
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
golden ratio is one of my major inspirations.

381
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Can you explain that?

382
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah.

383
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Well, if anybody is listening at this time

384
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
in their lights are on,

385
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
if you look at your thumb,

386
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
the distance between

387
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
the knuckle to the middle of your thumb,

388
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
and that to the end of your thumb,

389
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
is the golden ratio.

390
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's dividing a line into two parts,

391
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
where the division is not half.

392
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It would have to be 0.5.

393
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It would be at 0.618.

394
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And it sets up a mathematical harmonic

395
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
where the smaller is to the larger.

396
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So the first little part is to the second part

397
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
as the second part is to the entire thumb.

398
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It just keeps going.

399
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
If you look at your next finger,

400
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
it's the first part of the knuckle

401
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
to the second part, to the third part.

402
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Yeah.

403
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
If anybody, if you draw a 5.8 star,

404
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and where the lines intersect,

405
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
that is also the golden ratio,

406
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
a point of social goal,

407
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
golden section, golden mean proportion,

408
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
lists the Fibonacci series,

409
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
several diales at all the time,

410
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
a lot of artists MC Escher,

411
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
it's part of everything.

412
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Is this a,

413
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
a mathematical or,

414
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
or physics equation that is,

415
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
there are several ways that you can derive it.

416
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You could first talk about it.

417
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
One way to get it is the square root of 5,

418
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
plus 1 divided by 2.

419
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And that gives you 1.618,

420
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
or the square root of 5 minus 1 divided by 2,

421
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
which is the 0.618.

422
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
As far as the Fibonacci,

423
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
which is a mathematical series

424
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
where the next number in the sequences

425
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
derived by adding the 2 before,

426
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
so 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.

427
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
When you then get to 89,

428
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
over 55,

429
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
that gives you 1.618.

430
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So there's several ways to get it,

431
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
a self-server to his fee,

432
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
and it's,

433
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
it's a bizarre,

434
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
amazing magical thing.

435
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Another indication of its magical powers,

436
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I would say,

437
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
0.618,

438
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
if you divide 1 by 0.618,

439
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
you get 1.618,

440
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
which is the same thing.

441
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
If you add 0.618 to 1,

442
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
which is 1.8 to 1.

443
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
So this number,

444
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
which is 1.8,

445
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
you can divide it into 1

446
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
or add it to 1,

447
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
and get the same answer.

448
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's the kind of indication.

449
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Wow, that's crazy,

450
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
man.

451
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
That's the thing.

452
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
If I give you this,

453
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
you give it back to me,

454
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
you know,

455
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
it will be the last distance again.

456
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
That's crazy.

457
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You give it a bud,

458
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
and in my mother gets high.

459
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And in nobody coughs,

460
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
that's crazy.

461
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
The bubbles is flipping.

462
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Oh, so funny.

463
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You were explaining that to someone last night

464
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
to get a performance.

465
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And I think you actually thought you were still telling a joke.

466
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
When I started scuiving into my mathematics stuff,

467
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
which is,

468
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I referred to as moleeds.

469
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And I actually did the moleeds on the tenetra years ago.

470
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And I said,

471
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
moleeds,

472
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
that's the name of the,

473
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
what I consider the primary particle of the universe,

474
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
where everything is based on.

475
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And we're working on for 28 years.

476
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I went out to dinner last week with this great French artist,

477
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
named Jill Bruvelle.

478
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Once again, I plug for other people.

479
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Bruvelle, B.R.U.V.

480
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Sounds like he needs it.

481
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Bruvelle, like,

482
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
oh, this guy, he's, he's a genius.

483
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
He's like a cross between,

484
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
if I had to cross it Salvador Dali

485
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
and served to Soleil.

486
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Okay.

487
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Just amazing artist.

488
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
He's French.

489
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And the waiter comes up and he goes,

490
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
moleeds.

491
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
We were talking about moleeds.

492
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Because he knew about moleeds.

493
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
He used to do a bit about, I did it.

494
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
We were talking about the bit.

495
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Because for those of us who were too young.

496
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Well, I think they would be moleeds.

497
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Everyone but me and Grandpa Shnove.

498
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Well, it's based on a relationship with the numbers 27 and 37.

499
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And the bit that I did was just,

500
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
you know, making some comedy out of the real math stuff.

501
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But in the last two years,

502
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I've made significant breakthroughs on it.

503
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm trying to compile it on house so that I can present it to people in the scientific community.

504
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So it can be proven in a way that will,

505
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
you know, bring me some, you know, some, some coin.

506
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Some equine respect, you know,

507
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
well, they don't give the Nobel Prize in mathematics.

508
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Really?

509
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah.

510
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And there's one theory that states,

511
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Nobel, who,

512
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
and then that nine of my, and started the prize.

513
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
How does that work together?

514
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
The dynamite thing in the past.

515
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
He just has money.

516
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
He just has money.

517
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And his girlfriend was basically

518
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
swept away and taken by a mathematician.

519
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So, you know, it's like, what about math?

520
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
No, we're not using math.

521
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Why not?

522
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Just Frank stole Becky.

523
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
But the other people say,

524
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
well, he considered math a part of everything.

525
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And there is another prize for mathematics,

526
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
but you have to be under 30 or something.

527
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But, you know, I am about the prizes about

528
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
you know, about the bitches.

529
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And it's about the changing science.

530
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That's, that's cool to me.

531
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
To me, the real rock stars are scientists.

532
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Not that, you know, you too, and those guys are all,

533
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
but, and some of those guys,

534
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
and 200 years, people still be playing there.

535
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
There's stuff, you know, probably Abba,

536
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
and the other groups.

537
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Abba in the movie.

538
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Abba in the movie.

539
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Exactly.

540
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
A new group.

541
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Although, Abba is a palindrome.

542
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It is.

543
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Absolutely.

544
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Which is important, kind of mathematical property.

545
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
My favorite palindrome, or palindrome,

546
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
if you actually listen to the words,

547
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
is Satan oscillate my metallic sonatas.

548
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Same back as in forwards.

549
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And palindromes are important, I think,

550
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
because they are back as in forwards.

551
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And there's a sequence in male DNA.

552
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
That is in the male, you know,

553
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
in the X-Wad.

554
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
That comes on that's palindromic,

555
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
which is kind of like backup.

556
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So does that mean that

557
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
palindromes work better on males?

558
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
No, it just means that, like,

559
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
because it's really the male that decides

560
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
whether it's going to be a boy or a girl.

561
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Okay.

562
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
So it, like, just to make sure the things are a

563
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
messed up, like, you know, we got some

564
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
messed-up sperm over here.

565
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Read it backwards.

566
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Oh, yeah, thank you, dude.

567
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So, like, you know, if you whack backwards,

568
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
it'll still come out.

569
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
That's why you know, when you whack, you can go

570
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
up or down.

571
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
He's like, it's a palindromic activity.

572
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Yeah, so my palindromes and back to numbers.

573
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And it's all, everything's related, essentially.

574
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And that's kind of part of the essence of the pod show,

575
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
which I believe at this point,

576
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
will be referred to as flashes universe.

577
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I think that.

578
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I like it.

579
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And it'll be video.

580
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I think it'll be video or radio.

581
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Pictures.

582
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yeah, it'll be work or just loud pictures.

583
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Turn off the picture.

584
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Turn off the sound.

585
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Yeah, I think videos.

586
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Good.

587
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Because a lot of the things that I want to communicate

588
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
are better communicated with visuals.

589
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Mm-hmm.

590
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And most of the work that I do as far as experimenting

591
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
and studying, I create pictures and then

592
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
study patterns.

593
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And that's how I kind of went to play the guitar.

594
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I made my own little chart so that I could

595
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
they'd be more visual.

596
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And I would make different colors.

597
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So I'd memorize the frigion mode and blue red and green.

598
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Just thinking that my brain would like maybe

599
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
be more partial to one color.

600
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Be easier to remember.

601
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah, you know, that some people, like it's easy to

602
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
remember that one color.

603
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Just I just like experimenting with visuals.

604
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm definitely very visually oriented as far as

605
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
processing information.

606
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
For some reason, I don't know what it's spatial or

607
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
facial or just I like looking at stuff.

608
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Have you decided what you want to be when you grow up?

609
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I decided that when I grow up, I want to be king of the universe.

610
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Well, but I'm not going to grow up for wild,

611
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
but I think the universe needs a king.

612
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And this is not to be confused with the duty.

613
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Not to be confused with call.

614
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
This is just king of the universe.

615
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It's just it's a social position.

616
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And there's responsibility because the galaxy is

617
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
and moving all apart.

618
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And there's a lot of dark matter out there.

619
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And, you know, I think it's a good, it's a good goal.

620
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You believe in extraterrestrial life?

621
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's not even belief.

622
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It's, you know, I know.

623
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I mean, we are extraterrestrial.

624
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
In some sense, just because, you know,

625
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
this is extra.

626
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
But, you know, the day it just

627
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
think that life is just here in 13 and

628
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
have been in years or so of this universe is just

629
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
really silly.

630
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Yeah.

631
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Of course.

632
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
As to whether they've been here recently or when

633
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
who knows, and I think glad UFOs are just that

634
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
they're identified flying objects.

635
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
But there's definitely lots of realms that we don't know about.

636
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And this whole system that we're having fun with

637
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
is a lot more magical than people think.

638
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Not all people like the magic people.

639
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And many people know, there are many levels.

640
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Then, you know, chakra five,

641
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
calling chakra four.

642
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Your dinty parts are ready for my

643
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
flopping web one.

644
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah.

645
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It's definitely this.

646
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Things are magical.

647
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I've learned anything from being here

648
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
these past two days.

649
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
That's a really good question.

650
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I learned that the coffee is better at night.

651
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Seems wrong.

652
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Yeah.

653
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I learned that the guys working in the other room are very

654
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
friendly.

655
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yes.

656
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I learned that I won't be a podcaster.

657
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And I think sometimes you learn something but don't know you've learned it

658
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
until later.

659
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And I've often heard people say that wisdom is being able to

660
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
know right after something happens how you would react

661
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
to suppose like a week later thinking, you know when I should have

662
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
sent a lawyer and I should have said, no man,

663
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
you put up the curtains.

664
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You fucking moron.

665
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
That's what I should have said to him.

666
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
He called me a loser trick trap.

667
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
And I'm too isolated.

668
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But by the way, you're a loser trick.

669
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Yeah, you put up the fucking curtains.

670
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Yeah.

671
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
That's wisdom.

672
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Okay.

673
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
So you didn't really learn that much from me.

674
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I don't know.

675
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You know, I know that I learned that there's a lot of really wealthy

676
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
people here.

677
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And there's some...

678
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Why did what I learned that you can really misjudge people

679
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
in the very first moment.

680
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And when I was doing my thing the other night,

681
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
we didn't when I was talking to the lawyer.

682
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Oh, yeah.

683
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Yeah.

684
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Well, I spoke to him later and he's like a really good human.

685
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
But very socially conscious and has kind of a spiritual center

686
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
and is really into doing more than just, you know, taking the coin.

687
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Oh, please.

688
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
He has your fooled.

689
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Is that what it was?

690
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Yeah.

691
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
That when it was good because you were so...

692
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I mean, maybe it's not fair to a lot of these people in the audience.

693
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Well, that's in the audience.

694
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Well, that's in the audience.

695
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Yeah.

696
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
That little moment.

697
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You came just by that.

698
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But then I knew it was okay, but after talking to him,

699
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I was surprised at the level of his social dedication

700
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
and his wanting to contribute.

701
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yeah, that's pretty much the culture of planet Perkins, though I have to say.

702
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Well, that's another theory.

703
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
That, I don't know.

704
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Another thing that amazed me that what you would think is basically greed

705
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
and monetary gain could somehow partner up with some kind of social responsibility.

706
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I suppose that is what I have learned.

707
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I've learned that even rich people.

708
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Lots of money in the ability to help people that are even rich,

709
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
and people who come at you can still have a quality.

710
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Like, you can raise corn and still have a movie theater.

711
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
You can eat pop tarts and still have a pop gun.

712
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You can cheat yourself in the foot and still have a metaphor that makes no sense.

713
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Tomorrow morning, there's a special viewing of Al Gore's movie.

714
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You're going to get up on one side.

715
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
You're going to get to the world.

716
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Because there's also Q&A with Al Gore after that.

717
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Yeah, but it's a satellite, but what an opportunity.

718
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Well, he was a Ted.

719
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Oh, you bet him?

720
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Yeah.

721
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
He, like, my, I presented there.

722
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And he said kind of things to me.

723
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Really?

724
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
He was actually hilarious as both of the fictitiously.

725
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
He was doing stand-up.

726
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
The first presentation was he was doing, you know,

727
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
basically the movie idea, which is important stuff.

728
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
But then he was doing stand-up.

729
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Yeah, he was talking about no longer being by his president and driving a tourist.

730
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Right, so he's got a whole wrap going for that.

731
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Yeah, he was really going to man if you lose the election.

732
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You got to have something going whenever someone meets you.

733
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
So he'd be like, you know, and either way, there's that losing thing.

734
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Maybe it was actually taking.

735
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Either way.

736
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Could be.

737
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Could be.

738
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
It doesn't matter what he is.

739
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
But he was very funny.

740
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And I offered to red jokes from the fiat we needed.

741
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And as he accepted, yeah.

742
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Well, I haven't heard from the director.

743
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Okay.

744
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
From some people that claimed to be out of work.

745
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So did it.

746
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Ted, did you do something similar?

747
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Ted is a technology entertainment design.

748
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It's once a year in Monterey.

749
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It's an exclusive invite only.

750
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It's a invite only.

751
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It's about five grand for three days.

752
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And it's like kind of a Star Trek college campus.

753
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And they have amazing presenters there.

754
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And I, for three years ago, they asked me to be there.

755
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Because Thomas Dolby is the musical director.

756
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
And his wife and Thomas used to see me in LA at the improv years ago.

757
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And they asked, and the theme of that one was happiness and Chris Anderson, who produced

758
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
it when a comedian.

759
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
And I did that one and then they asked me back.

760
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And then back again.

761
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And there are some really dynamic speakers.

762
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Two years ago, the last girl was speak.

763
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
18 year old girl talking about a cure for cancer.

764
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
How the heart is the only part of the body that didn't be cancer.

765
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I mean, this girl was extraordinary.

766
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And, you know, you hear things there that you read about in the paper five,

767
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
ten days later, you know, breakthroughs.

768
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
For real.

769
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Yeah, it's an amazing event.

770
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It's really, it's really cool.

771
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
So it's as a stand-up comedy always been kind of your platform,

772
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
your place for honing your skills.

773
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Well, one of them, that's one of the ways that I express myself

774
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
and do some kind of communication reciprocation.

775
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And I started that.

776
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I was pretty little, but I also had this need to express myself visually

777
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
as far as, you know, drawing or painting.

778
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And I called you.

779
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I mean, obviously, we only just met.

780
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So I haven't, you know, normally we've done research.

781
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
No, but I think it's better that way.

782
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Yeah, I think it's better.

783
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I just met a woman who knew nothing about anything that I've done.

784
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And that's better in a lot of ways.

785
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Because sometimes, you know, you just track people that are interested in you

786
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
because you've achieved something somewhere that is appealing to them

787
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
and that kind of attraction is usually based on some kind of

788
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
superficial attribute.

789
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So it's good because that way your questions are genuine

790
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
and not handed by, oh, when there's a question here,

791
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
it says, so tell me about the Franco Smokmark.

792
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
They tell you about it.

793
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
You know about it.

794
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
We discussed it yesterday.

795
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And a green in the green.

796
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
In the green.

797
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
That one on our flute.

798
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah.

799
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I mean, that's really what television and all.

800
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And all mainstream media has really become that.

801
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It's, it's one of the, I guess the eventual downfalls of anything that has structure.

802
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I mean, even films, you know, the three-act structure.

803
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
You know, you can kind of get around it, Quentin Tarantino.

804
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
You know, put the beginning at the end.

805
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
And there's different ways to tweak it.

806
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
But essentially movies have three acts.

807
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And you know, it's a little different because it's all based on time.

808
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And when you only have a channel and 24 hours in a day for that channel, then it has to,

809
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
you have to have regulation and structure.

810
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Sure.

811
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
You know, the show.

812
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It's something to me.

813
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
The first segment is this.

814
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And yeah, there's the guest.

815
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Yeah.

816
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
There's the pre-interview.

817
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And you got your five questions.

818
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And you know, I asked him three.

819
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And then they looked on the little card.

820
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And so tell me about this.

821
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And it's not as it's just so and graceful.

822
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
That's where Johnny Carson was really.

823
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
He was very different.

824
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
He was different.

825
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Yeah.

826
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And to me, Letterman is more accepting of that.

827
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And I found that he's become since he said a kid.

828
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I can sense in him change of growth.

829
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And he just seems to love more.

830
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Hmm.

831
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You know, and I think a kid can do that too.

832
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Very easily, probably.

833
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yeah.

834
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Yeah.

835
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And he was a great admirer of Johnny.

836
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And Carson used to write for him after he retired.

837
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
He would send jokes to Letterman.

838
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Yeah.

839
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Yeah.

840
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And Letterman was really in strong acknowledgement of that.

841
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And the whole Letterman Leno thing.

842
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And Leno got the show.

843
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And there was this thing.

844
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Leno didn't really pay tribute right.

845
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And Jay.

846
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Yeah.

847
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
That's all Hollywood stuff.

848
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I can't get so that.

849
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
But you know, I'm just happy people come make money telling jokes.

850
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's selling so.

851
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah.

852
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Yeah.

853
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
That's for sure.

854
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Very much what it is.

855
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Well, you know, if you really do get into.

856
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Into podcasting is the thing that I think you'll be brilliant at.

857
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Is helping us change advertising.

858
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Hmm.

859
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Because that's the real challenge.

860
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Well, advertising is is back to what is advertising sold on.

861
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Seconds.

862
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Twenty seconds, thirty seconds.

863
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Get the message out.

864
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Um, and the easiest way of courses.

865
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
If you use this product, you'll get laid.

866
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
If you don't use this product, your hair will fall out.

867
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I mean, that's two basic ways to get laid by someone.

868
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
So does it.

869
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Is it more of the product placement pattern as we're talking?

870
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
You know, when I walked over here, I, I watched my hands with this.

871
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Um, Agua soap.

872
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And if my.

873
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
No, no, no.

874
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
It's, that's the beauty.

875
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
It's, it's not about placing it.

876
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
You know, we're sneaking it in.

877
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Um, it's advertising is content.

878
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Um, people.

879
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
People.

880
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
So this show is brought to you by podcast.

881
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Actually, it's universe brought to you by.

882
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Well, no, uh, it could be, um, let me see, uh, an, an active example.

883
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
It could be brought to you by acupue contact lenses.

884
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
But, uh, maybe the whole show is one big commercial.

885
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Yeah.

886
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
People want.

887
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Content.

888
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
It's just content.

889
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
No matter what the subject will respond to your show.

890
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Or you have many.

891
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Many.

892
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Yeah.

893
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Many different ones.

894
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So it's earthling.

895
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Um, is one.

896
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Um,

897
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
We have, uh, as we have a couple of, uh,

898
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
internet related ones like go daddy.

899
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Um, I've secured them in.

900
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I'm going to go daddy.

901
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So, so by the asking away, but wait, if you use, uh, uh,

902
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
promotional code DSC three upon checkout, your domain name would have only cost you

903
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
$6.95.

904
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Yeah.

905
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Well, if you know where daddy goes.

906
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Because for 32.

907
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Yeah.

908
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Really.

909
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Yeah.

910
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
No daddy.

911
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
That's, uh, I love the names of new.

912
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Technology companies shifting.

913
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And I think it started, uh,

914
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I guess Yahoo.

915
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And then Red Hat.

916
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And, uh, that's not it.

917
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Oh, Google.

918
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Google.

919
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Google.

920
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Blue tooth.

921
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
You know, as a technology, just where it's become more poetic.

922
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Blue tooth has a history that name, though.

923
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
It was, um, Blue tooth was, I think it was a Viking.

924
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And yeah, his name was Blue tooth.

925
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Blue tooth.

926
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Yeah.

927
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
No, no.

928
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
It's a blue tooth.

929
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I can look it up.

930
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Yeah.

931
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Yeah.

932
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
It was Blue tooth.

933
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And he somehow, um, brought other Vikings together.

934
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And they weren't fighting with each other.

935
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And that's the whole idea.

936
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
That's Blue tooth.

937
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Oh, yeah.

938
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Yeah.

939
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Come on.

940
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
64.

941
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I think.

942
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

943
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
And Blue tooth connects multiple devices.

944
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Yeah.

945
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
That's really.

946
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Some of these names are actually based on.

947
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Sure.

948
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
They weren't messing with you here.

949
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
On nicotine.

950
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
The same day after this guy in the Cote.

951
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Really?

952
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Something to do with tobacco.

953
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
But, uh, the, uh, I blew too.

954
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I thought it was just like some guy, you know.

955
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I'm like an upper split one.

956
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Blue tooth.

957
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Green tree.

958
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Elemental wise trick.

959
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
White out.

960
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Here we go.

961
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
The blue tooth name in history.

962
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Hold on a second.

963
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I'm not kidding you man.

964
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
He's not kidding.

965
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
For this we've bossing us.

966
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
He is actually going to some sort of digital device.

967
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Which is probably not a sponsor.

968
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
But could be at the speed, but he is using it.

969
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Could be a blue bear.

970
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Black there.

971
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
A raspberry.

972
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Raspberry.

973
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Eric Carmen.

974
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Was that raspberry?

975
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Eric Carmen.

976
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Yeah.

977
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And then it was in a group of color raspberries.

978
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Uh, out of, uh, Cleveland, maybe?

979
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
That's the raspberries.

980
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
No.

981
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
No?

982
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Eric Carmen.

983
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Yes.

984
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
He was.

985
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Eric Carmen in the raspberries.

986
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Here we go.

987
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Harold Bluetooth.

988
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I was close.

989
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Oh, Carl Luther.

990
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Yeah, Viking.

991
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Not a Viking to call a Harold.

992
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
It's from Denmark.

993
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
He was king of Denmark.

994
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Can you second it?

995
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
In the late, in the late 900's.

996
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
That's, that's like hundreds.

997
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
The same Harold?

998
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Harold.

999
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Oh, yeah.

1000
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
That's a big difference.

1001
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Wow.

1002
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
He managed to unite Denmark in part of Norway into a single kingdom, then introduced

1003
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Christianity into Denmark.

1004
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
He left a large monument.

1005
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
The jelly room stone.

1006
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
In memory of parents.

1007
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
He was killed in 986 during the battle with the sun.

1008
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Schwedd forkbeard.

1009
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I'm not making the shit out.

1010
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
You're not.

1011
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Put the guy who wrote it.

1012
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
No.

1013
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm not saying.

1014
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Forkbeard and Bluetooth.

1015
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And the giant gel stone.

1016
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Here.

1017
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I'm not saying.

1018
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Is this a Wikipedia?

1019
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
No.

1020
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
But this is, well, no.

1021
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
You can find this in many, many places on the internet.

1022
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
This name for the standard indicates how important companies from the Baltic region.

1023
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Nations, including Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland are to the communications industry.

1024
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Even if it says little about the way the technology works.

1025
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I've heard a different version of that.

1026
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Well, you know.

1027
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
But it's something that there wasn't Harold Bluetooth.

1028
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It does bring up an interesting point.

1029
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
It is how much of history it really happened.

1030
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I mean, really, I know what, you know, I can see.

1031
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And before Photoshop, what videos you've seen.

1032
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And there's a lot, you know.

1033
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:05,000
They don't teach the Armenian genocide in American schools because we have military bases in Turkey.

1034
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
So things are obscured and hidden.

1035
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
That's for all my Armenian friends.

1036
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I don't know if you're young, young, and any.

1037
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Or Tom Palayanian.

1038
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
So, you know, something you think may have happened.

1039
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
But you know that the agenda of the white man, and I use that metaphorically, is, is

1040
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
one who will like twist stuff up to make his plate fuller.

1041
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Well, well, either purposely or not.

1042
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Because, you know, somebody's reading the document.

1043
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And then he took cloth pro to the river.

1044
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I don't think he meant river.

1045
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I think he really meant stream.

1046
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Because, like, 12 gigabytes, and all of a sudden,

1047
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Plopra had a system that was 19 gigahertz.

1048
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And that gigaavis.

1049
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And some things, you think, are real.

1050
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But Bluetooth and fork-paired.

1051
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I'm just, I'm skeptical.

1052
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It just sounds a little too funny to me.

1053
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
The Harold Bluetooth.

1054
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Harold Bluetooth.

1055
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I didn't think Harold was a common name.

1056
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Harold.

1057
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Oh, Harold.

1058
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Oh, Harold.

1059
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Oh, Harold.

1060
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Harold Bluetooth.

1061
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Mr. Forkbeard.

1062
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Your Bluetooth is ready.

1063
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Mr. Yellow S.

1064
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Mr. White calling.

1065
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Mr. Green fork.

1066
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
That's just the eye of that.

1067
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
But I had to see.

1068
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
And what about Red Hat?

1069
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Is that Thomas Red Hat of?

1070
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I don't know what the genesis is behind Red Hat.

1071
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I think it's just weed behind most of these things.

1072
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Well, it certainly helps me to understand all the names better.

1073
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Well, and not just you, you know, everybody that, you know, has a bluetooth

1074
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
or Red Hat or a Sun Microsystem.

1075
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Yeah.

1076
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Growing up in Amsterdam, it was pretty much the way the way you go through life.

1077
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
You were supposed to be alone.

1078
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Delta 9.

1079
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And, you know, in this country, alcohol was legal.

1080
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Yeah.

1081
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Beginning of last week in some places, if you're 12.

1082
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And I don't think it's changed quickly.

1083
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Yeah.

1084
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
But I'm still amazed at Harold Bluetooth.

1085
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I think it's the Fort Bay.

1086
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I don't know why they didn't go with Fort Bay or just the name.

1087
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I didn't even go with Fort Bay or technology.

1088
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Fort Bay or the BirdFork.

1089
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I wonder what, what, what.

1090
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Yeah.

1091
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It's.

1092
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Oh, Harold Blatton.

1093
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
There you go.

1094
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
That was, it's a bluetooth.

1095
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
This is, of course.

1096
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Oh, but a song.

1097
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Is, of course, a translation of the Blatton.

1098
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Well, a mastodon means milk tooth.

1099
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Okay.

1100
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
You know, the woolly mammoth, the mastodon.

1101
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Oh, yeah.

1102
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Milk tooth.

1103
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
It's the big tusks.

1104
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
There were calling milk tooth.

1105
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
So Bluetooth could have been milk tooth.

1106
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
It was like, if it had like a larger trunk.

1107
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
It may be more bandwidth.

1108
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
It smelled like, you know, I could earn this ass.

1109
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Blatton.

1110
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Blatton.

1111
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Harold Blatton.

1112
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Yes.

1113
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
But this year, mother, I have Blatton.

1114
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
No.

1115
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
My flat student doesn't have a blue ass.

1116
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
And green hurl.

1117
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Blue teeth.

1118
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Well, the thing about this just goes to shade.

1119
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
You could be entertained.

1120
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And you may find out something that's educational or a lie or a combination.

1121
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I think five-sight theater had a record.

1122
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Just go everything you know is wrong.

1123
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Which kind of speaks that whole premise.

1124
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And I was looking at about just writing a bunch of just new history.

1125
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
You're a Steve Gilmore?

1126
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Steve Gilmore?

1127
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Steve Gilmore.

1128
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
He produced a lot of fires at theater.

1129
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I remember Proctor and Bergman.

1130
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
He was really the producer.

1131
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Or at least so.

1132
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
He claims.

1133
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
He's in Wikipedia for a few years.

1134
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And Blatton.

1135
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
He also does a couple of podcasts.

1136
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
For all bozos on this bus.

1137
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Fashioned theater.

1138
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I remember back in the...

1139
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
It was kind of podcasts.

1140
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
But that was part of the day.

1141
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
It was surreal.

1142
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
It was definitely out there.

1143
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
And that was when FM radio could still put on.

1144
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You know, you could put stuff on.

1145
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
No one would give a shit.

1146
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
And I guess that's not true anymore, is it?

1147
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
No, but FM radio at the time is.

1148
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Okay, now I'm going to play Zeppelin the key of G.

1149
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Now it's all play this and it's all corporate and blackmail.

1150
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Which is why this is really the new way.

1151
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And no concept of limited resources of frequency or spectrum.

1152
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Ordination.

1153
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I mean, that's the big one.

1154
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Direction.

1155
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Incredible.

1156
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Yeah.

1157
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Because like how long is this show?

1158
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
How long can you go?

1159
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Yeah.

1160
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
How many days a left before the end of the world?

1161
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,000
What happens is your audience starts to tell you what is right for them.

1162
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And it will be different for every show.

1163
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And of course, it's different for lots of people.

1164
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
But I usually make 40 minutes.

1165
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And 40 minutes seems to be right for most of the people who listen to my...

1166
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
To my program.

1167
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
There is a duration time.

1168
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I sometimes want to go on a club at the comedy store.

1169
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And if the show starts at nine and you're 11 people have been there for so many hours,

1170
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
there's a point where how long can you laugh?

1171
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I mean, how long can you eat and how long can you have sex?

1172
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
It's just like a point where you say, like, you know, I've really been laughing.

1173
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
One of the time I want to check out laughing.

1174
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And my cheekbones are...

1175
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
And the computers, the memory, you know, that's limited.

1176
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
But I think with the human mind, I don't think pass you.

1177
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
You could like, fill it all up and then you say, oh, yeah, and bring some salt.

1178
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
You can put a disk as full.

1179
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
You can't see anything.

1180
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
You can't see anything.

1181
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
No, I can't see anything.

1182
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I've always kept it.

1183
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I got to let you remember.

1184
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Oh, bring some salt.

1185
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
That's not a problem.

1186
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I got it.

1187
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I got that extra gigabyte.

1188
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
That's not what it is with Haral Bluton.

1189
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
The big untap resource.

1190
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
All right, man.

1191
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Listen, it's almost midnight.

1192
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So...

1193
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Well, this went for the test.

1194
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
That was how long was this podcast?

1195
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
This is 43 minutes.

1196
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Wow.

1197
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
See?

1198
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I didn't even...

1199
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I didn't even look at the time.

1200
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Well, a 40 is often associated with waiting.

1201
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
The word quarantine, which comes from the Rippler 40,

1202
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
waiting for days, Moses, the desert 40 years ago.

1203
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
No, not 40 days and 40 nights.

1204
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Right.

1205
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Right.

1206
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
It begins at 40.

1207
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
See, this is what I like about you.

1208
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
The most is you have this incredible amount of historical knowledge.

1209
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
You know, it's like a huge skewer data.

1210
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
But I can bring it up at the right time.

1211
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
It's like I got that with song lyrics.

1212
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Yeah.

1213
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
It's like, you know, a snoop, but with a collar.

1214
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Yeah.

1215
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
But that's cool.

1216
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
You know, that's a very good point though, 40, 40 being another magical number.

1217
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
There are magical.

1218
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
But it's numbers are associated off and with, with constructs or events.

1219
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And, you know, prime numbers.

1220
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
But prime numbers.

1221
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
That's another podcast.

1222
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Yes.

1223
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
And, um, I look forward to, uh, to casting my own pod upon this room.

1224
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Well, um, we're going to hook you up.

1225
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Um, I'm glad.

1226
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
And I, uh, I thank you for this opportunity.

1227
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
And I just like to say to all the creatures in the jelly room.

1228
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
You can leave now.

1229
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
The jelly people went away.

1230
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I think that means you should turn off the machine.

1231
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
And we can return the jelly monkeys to the slippery dreams.

1232
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Fantastic.

1233
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Well, there you go.

1234
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:23,000
That's, uh, Charles Flasher, uh, recorded, um, at the, uh, at the, uh, the heck is the name of this place that we're at?

1235
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Where are we at?

1236
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
On?

1237
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Yeah.

1238
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
What's the name of the hotel?

1239
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Can you ask me?

1240
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Yeah.

1241
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Look, quick.

1242
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I got, like, 45 more seconds.

1243
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
What's the name of the hotel?

1244
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
It's a, it's, uh, thank you.

1245
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
