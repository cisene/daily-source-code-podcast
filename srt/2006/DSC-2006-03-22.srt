1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now, Delta Sierra Charlie 358.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
then the next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Justing here's an angry.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Why didn't think that he would all be less or not stuck comedy?

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I didn't know that every night will make it the best to me.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Well, I'll just gotta get through this world.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll just gotta get through this world.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'll just gotta get through this world.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll just gotta get through this world.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:22,000
When new lessons feels like getting pushed in some of that to me.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Keep hanging on to the old that it might all come back for me.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Well, I'll just gotta get through this world.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll just gotta get through this world.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll just gotta get through this world.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'll just gotta get through this world.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'll just to lonely girl.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll just to lonely girl.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll just to lonely girl.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll just to lonely girl.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll just to lonely girl.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The tip of the love is hidden everywhere in the darkest nights.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
With lightning bugs at shine, feeling you can't see your light.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, I'll just gotta get through this world.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'll just gotta get through this world.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll just gotta get through this world.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'll just gotta get through this world.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I just gotta get through this world

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I just gotta get through this world

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I gotta smile at any time

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm just the one who's going on

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm not just the one who's going on

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm not just the one who's going on

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
From New York, very coral, an aspiring angel

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
From the Podsate Music Network, good morning

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Everybody are good afternoon, good evening

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Wherever you are, wherever you're listening to this podcast

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It is the daily source code coming to you from Curricondo

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And once again, not a sunny day

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's really hard, you know

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I, last time I was out here the weather was so beautiful

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And it was so much easier to be up

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And really energetic because, you know, the sun would be rising up over the bay

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And just throwing its rays all the way to the mountain range

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
All across the city

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And today it's just grey, grey, grey

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And I'm a little bit bummed down

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
In fact, that's song by Barry Coral

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I want to dedicate that to a good friend of mine

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Amanda Monaco of the Bitties

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And here's why

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is Amanda Monaco from the list of serious bitties and bitty cast

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Here are 2005, I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
An autoimmune disease in the central nervous system

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Multiple sclerosis can create trouble walking, vision loss, numbness and loss of cognitive function

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Among other things

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Thankfully, I'm doing very well

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And living my life in the most part is I always have

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But there are many others who are less fortunate than I

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So please join the bitties and our team, team bitty

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
An April 23rd at New York City, South Street, C-Port for the MS Walk

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
New York City 2006

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Go to bittycast.com, B-I-D-D-Y-C-A-S-T

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
To join the team or make a donation through team bitty

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Our goal is to raise $10,000 from this research

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And we're sure we can do it with your help

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
On your percent of the proceeds, go to research programs

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I can use support for people with MS

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Thanks

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So again, here's something like that, man

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's just like

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Bums you out this early in the morning

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I heard CC Chapman's

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I think it was on U-Turn Cafe

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
CC's gonna go, sorry

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He's going to New York, he's gonna help out

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't know where I am if I can get to New York

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Of course, I'd love to participate

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But I think I can help out

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
In other ways as well, so I'll definitely do that

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Love you girls, love you Amanda

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Alrighty then

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Hope you saw the video

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That I put up last night, I'm on a roll now

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Now that I figured out I'm movie

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Which is still not quite the system

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Man, I guess I have to get Final Cut Pro loaded

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm machine, so I can really do some editing

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I movie doesn't let you do all the chroma key stuff

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And mixing things in, it's very, very

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It seems more basic than it used to be

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
They get simpler for some reason

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That I'd lose some of the features

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Or if they've been hidden and I just can't find them

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So that was the, the iPod implant video

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That, that I rolled out yesterday

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And I guess pretty soon I'll start putting this on on its own feed

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But for right now, I'm really kind of enjoying the distribution

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That the daily source code feed has

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And only one person, well no one is complaining about

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We're putting videos mixing those up with the shows

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And you can understand why I'm doing it, right?

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Because if I have to start a whole new feed

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The question is, you know, do I get the same exposure?

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Well, that many, actually it's a good experiment

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'll start a new feed, okay?

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The minute the pdn goes live, I'll have a new feed for the videos

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And then we'll see if we can build up a new feed in the meantime

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
If you got something fun just to share

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
With the source code audience, if it's a short clip of something

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Send it off to me, I'd be happy to play it

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And of course, really looking for the music videos

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And I already have a couple of enough to, I got enough stacked up

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
To take me through

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
At least through next week

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
If you're checking us out on serious stars 102, this is the pod show

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Line up four hours every single day

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
From 6 pm to 10 pm eastern 3 to 7 Pacific

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We kick it off with a daily source code

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's always followed by Pacific Coast Hellway, East Radio, Don and Drew

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And of course, I don't have my satellite repairman, Uncle Jesse

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
PW offense and line up here

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So I don't know what the hell out

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh wait, tonight I think is a DVD weekly tonight

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I know he's sitting there listening to this going

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Ah, curry you idiot, I should send you a message every single day

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Hey Adam, I'm loving the videos

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But I'm a little concerned about the one dated for March 22nd

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm almost afraid to ask

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What do you plug in to charge an ad media?

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Hope this action isn't performed in the same port where biodiesel was produced

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't think that you would input through an output port

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But you know, you never know

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So let me know what the deal is there

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And hope you have an a great day

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And safe travels my friend, take care

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
This is so much hot for the piles

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't know, we'll talk to each other

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
There are so many horrible comments I could make about that

141
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Who's at crushland.com

142
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But I do kind of like a bidirectional ports to be quite honest

143
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
If you haven't seen the video, you gotta go check it out

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
To really appreciate the full spectrum of that particular comment

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Let me see, I had another piece of feedback

146
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And one of the short stuff was really nice

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Hey Adam, just watch the day at Potcho

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And wow, too many transitions

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Holy crap

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Other than that, it's pretty good

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But damn man cut back

152
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Cut back on the transitions

153
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Well, you know what else you can't really do overlapping video

154
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's very hard to cut up

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I mean, what you want to do with videos you want to be able to separate

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Well, you can separate the audio from the video track and I'm movie

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But you really want to, it's hard

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Because it does all this automatic, you know, connecting bits

159
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That you've just cut and then your audio gets out of sync

160
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And it doesn't, the program for as good as Final Cut Pro is

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm movie does not think the way I think when it comes down to editing

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So, and God, that's hard stuff

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That takes a long time

164
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Rendering and waiting and transferring

165
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And it's not, you know, I was talking to you to Cali

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah, you saw some pieces of pieces

167
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You saw some of Cali's bits, the UK podcast

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Listeners are laughing now

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You saw some of Cali's bits on that video probably

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And it was interesting

171
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We had a conversation

172
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh man, it was it with Cali and I think it was

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah, it was with Cali and I knew we were talking about video programs

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And they said something really interesting

175
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
They said, hey, you know, do you have any plans to make a cast

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Blaster for video?

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And it hit me like a ton of bricks and like, wow, that would be really interesting

178
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And if you consider the way cast Blaster works

179
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Which is not a post-editing, but it's a real-time tool

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It may actually be very possible

181
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I have no idea because, you know, quick time

182
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Of course is not really a native Windows product

183
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So, excuse me

184
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh god, would I love a sense sale right now?

185
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh man, in fact, I'm just homesick in general

186
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
If you don't mind me saying

187
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm really ready to go back home

188
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But got a couple more days, Saturday is when we travel back

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And it's just, I miss talking to the girls all the time

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You know, we're so limited to like 15 or 20 minutes a day

191
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Because when, you know, by the time that I'm done with the show

192
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And I've gotten my morning started

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Then I call home and they're about ready to go to bed

194
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And you're always in the different mood

195
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's very, very hard to coordinate

196
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
As you know, Patricia never listens to the show

197
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So sometimes I feel dumb just spent on talking about

198
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Life out here on the show

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And then I forget all the things I was going to tell her in real life

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And I can't wait to be back home and have her on the show

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That'll be even better

202
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And I get so many people asking me to get her on the show again

203
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
She definitely is the big surprise of the source code

204
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Hey, it's very exciting day today

205
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You may have run across an announcement

206
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
In the past day or two

207
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
About a brand new promotion

208
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Actually I have my little info sheet here

209
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
We had a name for it

210
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It was, oh gosh, I don't have it on this sheet

211
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It was like one brand of thousand voices or something like that

212
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And many voices

213
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It was something really good that we came up with

214
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What's happening as of today is we have about 50 podcasts

215
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
On the network now on the pod show network

216
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And today everybody who is a listener

217
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
To the daily source code

218
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Can get all kinds of great deals at GoDaddy

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
GoDaddy.com

220
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
When you register domain name

221
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And I've noticed that this is almost addictive to some people

222
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
There are people who go to go to GoDaddy

223
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Almost every single day

224
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Just to see what domain names are available

225
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And they come up with great ideas for friends

226
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Giving away a wacky domain name

227
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And putting a web page up

228
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And there's all kinds of services that GoDaddy has

229
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That make it help you do that really easily

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And the way we're doing it now is every podcaster

231
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I mean this is a part of the quit your day job campaign

232
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And there are some people who based upon their downloads

233
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
They're actually going to make some nice money on this particular promotion

234
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The way it works is in my case

235
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
If you're listening to the source code

236
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And you want to get one or not one of these great deals

237
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Which is what do we have?

238
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
10% discount

239
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
On anything you purchase from GoDaddy

240
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We have five dollars off any order of 30 dollars or more

241
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And we have another one which is

242
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Domain name for just 695 a year

243
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So for either

244
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You know, let's just go with the domain name for 695 a year

245
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Because that's probably what most people go after

246
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
When you go to GoDaddy.com

247
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Enter DSC3 as in Delta Sierra Charlie 3

248
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And then in my case I'll actually get credited for you buying that

249
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
This is like an affiliate program almost

250
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
In fact it's exactly what it is

251
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Now you don't have to fill out DSC3

252
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Because I'll never see any of that money

253
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Because whenever we sign someone up

254
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Then the podcaster who who's code is used makes money

255
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So listen to your favorite podcaster

256
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Find out what their code is

257
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
They'll be talking about it and enter that

258
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And then you actually support that podcaster at the same time

259
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
If you're going to buy a domain name anyway

260
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You might as well do it

261
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
For instance, you could enter the code for these guys

262
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Hey Pearl, what you doing?

263
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm starting my own website

264
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
How do you do that?

265
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Well first I go to GoDaddy.com

266
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And register my own domain name

267
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
For as low as 695

268
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
A year

269
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I just registered Pearl but go for

270
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
GoDaddy sounds easy

271
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
After that goDaddy.com can help me with the hosting

272
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And the website building

273
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And when I'm all done they put me in traffic blazer

274
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Which submits my site to 200 search engines and directories

275
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
GoDaddy sounds good

276
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
They are

277
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
They're my number one overall for web domain registration

278
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
By the domain name wire survey

279
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
How do I get started?

280
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
As a podcaster podcaster

281
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You can get special prices at godaddy.com

282
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You can get 10% off any order

283
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Or you can get $5 off any order of 30 dollars or more

284
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Or you can get your domain name for just $6.95

285
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Since a year

286
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Get out of the way Pearl

287
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I want my piece of the internet at godaddy.com

288
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Get your piece of the internet at godaddy.com

289
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And there are really no rules

290
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
With how the podshow podcasters promote this

291
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So if you have any great ideas for different way of

292
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Advertising that

293
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Let me know the go first is just one way

294
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Speaking of advertising

295
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Now here's some blatant advertising I received in email

296
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Hey Adam

297
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's Andrew Grummit here

298
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh no it's Andrew Grummit

299
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh no!

300
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
The man behind juice

301
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The man behind iPodder

302
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The man behind gigadil

303
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Her listeners may know

304
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I recently moved my family across the country to join up with podshow

305
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
In San Francisco

306
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
With that behind an absolutely killer condo

307
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And some of El Massachusetts

308
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And it was a tough call

309
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But we decided to put it on the market

310
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm sending a link along in case anyone out there in the

311
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Boston corner of the podosphere

312
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Is looking for a new place to call home

313
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
They may be interested to know that the property in question

314
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Was the birthplace of gigadil

315
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
An incubator of the iPodder lemon software

316
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Now known is juice

317
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Well that's all for now

318
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Thanks Adam

319
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
See you tomorrow at HQ

320
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You mean see in a couple hours at HQ

321
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And he sent this last night of course

322
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Hey you know

323
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Have you ever been to Thomas Alva Edison's home

324
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And New Jersey and you know it's a museum now

325
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And you see his laboratory

326
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That his workshop and where he slept

327
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And you know there's like some some of his inventions

328
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Like a rubber rubber rubber rubber

329
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Indian rubber

330
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
He was he had something to do with the invention of rubber

331
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Thank you Thomas

332
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Thank you so much

333
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
To imagine

334
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You know you could actually have

335
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The home of Andrew Grummit

336
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Just like the museum that is now

337
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Thomas Alva Edison's former home

338
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You could own that

339
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'll put the link in the show notes

340
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And yes this time I actually will put it in the show notes

341
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We've got to tell you over the weekend

342
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
We had a lot of fun

343
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I hooked up with Mark Yosimoto Nemkov

344
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And we worked on a new pod show production

345
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You know we have pod show LA

346
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Which is essentially this shack on Venice Beach

347
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Which has a lock on it

348
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
But you know there's not really a lot of equipment in it anyway

349
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
But it seems people do seem to kind of use the shack

350
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Sometimes when Mark isn't there for other things

351
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
But that's where we're working on a couple of different shows

352
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
One of them is a game show called Boned

353
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And I think we'll be starting that in a couple of weeks

354
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And the game shows are fun to figure out and put together

355
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Because you need some really good elements

356
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And in this case it's going to be a game show between two contestants

357
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I if I want to understand Dawn and Drew

358
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
We're actually going to be on one of the first episodes

359
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And it's a trivia game show but you can bone your apartment at your apartment

360
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You can bone your opponent

361
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And you can only imagine how much fun that is

362
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And as a Mark and I were actually the first two test contestants

363
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And unbeknownst to him I'm actually very good at all this trivia

364
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm a great at jeopardy and any TV trivia quiz

365
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I love doing that

366
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So let's just say

367
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I boneed Mark really really good

368
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The latest show

369
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000

We talk about cooking the Bible opera with interviews

372
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I talk about Brendan the star

373
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
No one else does that

374
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Sometimes fitness I always have some commentary

375
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I talk about my life and more

376
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000

We revolve around you

396
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
As interviewed on Eat This Hot Show

397
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Which is from Q-border.org

398
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's a Madge Weinstein-Ragan Fox

399
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And Wanda Wisdom

400
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And I actually I didn't had no idea how the show

401
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What's going to turn out

402
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And they edited it as a triple ender

403
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
So everyone records their own piece

404
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And they put it together later

405
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And they do edit it down to about 30 or 40 minutes

406
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And I think we talked for probably an hour

407
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So some pieces we're missing from the actual recording

408
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
We're not missing but we're taking out

409
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But in hindsight the show is kind of good

410
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And it's interesting to have a conversation with this particular trio

411
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Because they really don't hold back

412
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But one of the things that came up

413
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Was about promos on the source code

414
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And about members joining the network

415
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You definitely should check it out eatthishotshow.com

416
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And at a certain point I said hey you know

417
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
This is great community of queer cast

418
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
There's a Q-border.com

419
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
But just so you know I rarely

420
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
If ever receive a promo from from the homo

421
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And so and I say that because literally

422
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
In my email after doing the show

423
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
There's just tons of emails coming

424
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I mean you should see my I'm amazed

425
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
My spam blocker isn't kicking in

426
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's like hey you know

427
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Queer over here

428
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
A homo with a promo

429
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
So I really appreciate it

430
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And I'm rolling them out for you guys and girls

431
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Do you ever think that everyone in Texas

432
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Fux their sister

433
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Don't that night

434
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
A big and fresh

435
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Big and fresh

436
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Welcome find out

437
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What really happens in Texas

438
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
With Mikey Pod on the Bayou

439
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
With Michael Heron

440
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That Mikey Pod.com

441
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Michael serves as listeners

442
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Even in a face of danger

443
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
When Hurricane Rita approached

444
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Mikey Pod was there

445
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Look at the waves

446
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I can't just sit here anymore

447
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We've gotta go outside and cover this

448
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm gonna take my recorder outside

449
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Are you?

450
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I have to bring in my O to my listeners

451
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Michael now

452
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
We're just gonna go outside

453
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I can't just sit here and let this happen

454
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Without people knowing

455
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I've got to

456
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The real deal

457
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Mikey Pod on the Bayou

458
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Count on him for more

459
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Unless he's at a hard night

460
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Before and then

461
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Well it's kind of heavy

462
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Mikey Pod on the Bayou

463
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
He's welcoming you right now

464
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Subscribe at Mikey Pod.com

465
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
We're looking up in iTunes

466
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
While that promo was running

467
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I got a fuck

468
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Let me see if I can retrieve the voice mail

469
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You've got to hear this

470
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
This is too funny

471
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yeah, we work weird hours at Pod Show

472
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Let me see if I can get this

473
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Hold on

474
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's gonna sound like shit on the black barriers

475
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I think

476
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So

477
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm trying to get

478
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I don't know if you could hear that

479
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
But that was

480
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
K2

481
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Kevin ready

482
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Who's working on our

483
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Mashboard development

484
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And so I guess he went to the office

485
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Around 7, 7, 30 or something like that

486
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
7, 20 actually

487
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Looking at the time

488
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And we just had the alarm

489
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Installation put in

490
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Sounds like he opened the door

491
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The alarm went off

492
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And he's just called

493
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Any number he can

494
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
He's probably going to get arrested

495
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And when they see this guy

496
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
They're not going to believe his story

497
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
They could say, yeah

498
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Sure you work here

499
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Sure

500
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Well absolutely

501
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I know Adam Roger here

502
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I heard your concerns on

503
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Daily source code about the power cuts

504
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Fortunately we don't get that many of them in

505
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Go for it

506
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
But if you do run out then you're more than welcome to come

507
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Round to my house

508
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
We've got lots of candles

509
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And plenty of blind kits to cut a lapini

510
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
If he wants

511
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I might not want to leave Trinity

512
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Sooner any candles

513
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Will that me fain around

514
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
She might blow up

515
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm sure if he doesn't have any of

516
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Your own parts before

517
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Then you'll have witnessed that phenomenon

518
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Anyway

519
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It was nice to hear your little interview on

520
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Eat this hot show

521
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And so

522
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Goodbye to now

523
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And made the wind be with you

524
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Roger so good to hear from you

525
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Actually I think

526
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I have to be honest

527
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I don't think there's a guy in the world

528
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm only talking about guys

529
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But I'm sure there's some girls too

530
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Who haven't tried to light one up

531
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You know

532
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Why do we have to do that

533
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
What is it about us

534
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And how old were you when you last tried that?

535
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I know exactly when I last tried it

536
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And it wasn't all that successful

537
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
But I know it wasn't all in the 50

538
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Yeah

539
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Roger

540
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Ready

541
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Go

542
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
There's another message

543
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Roger

544
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Roger

545
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Roger

546
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm looking

547
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Actually there's a lot of UK feedback

548
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I've been getting

549
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It's really noticeable

550
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Not quite sure what happened

551
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
But all of a sudden

552
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
In fact, I'm going a lot of email from people saying

553
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh, yeah, I decided to tune back in

554
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And see what's going

555
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And that's fine by the way

556
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm happy, please go away

557
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000

558

So Jason

595
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Why aren't you letting everyone know

596
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
The website

597
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000

598
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000

Because you just know

600
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
My line

601
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
That's why

602
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Oh

603
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It's like a hundred new shows

604
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Coming out a day

605
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
If you attract it on podcast

606
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Ali is unbelievable

607
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
How many cool podcasts are out there

608
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And of course, I'm gonna fall

609
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
By the wayside

610
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
But wow

611
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
That episode is really really good

612
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Email here

613
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Came in through the

614
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
G-mails

615
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
From Mike Martin

616
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Adam found an interesting

617
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Connection between your recent

618
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Discussion on Oil

619
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And your Uncle Don

620
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Recently I saw the film

621
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Seriana

622
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Which is all about the oil industry

623
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And I liked it

624
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Enough that I picked up the book

625
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
On which it was based

626
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
The book is called

627
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Sino Evil by Robert Bayer

628
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Basically it's an autobiographical story

629
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Of a CIA operative

630
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Becoming frustrated

631
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
With the CIA's

632
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Increasing dependence on technology

633
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Base surveillance

634
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Overmore traditional methods

635
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And we all know how that worked out

636
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It turns out this is just one of three or four

637
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Storylines running through the film

638
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Who should pop up on page 29

639
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
During training in 1976

640
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
But Uncle Don Greg

641
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
So here's a quote from the book

642
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And I have not read the book

643
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Nor have I seen the movie

644
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Yet I think version has it

645
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So I'll look at the movie

646
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I guess it's not in the movie

647
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And only in the book

648
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Shoot

649
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I could watch the movie

650
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And read the book on my way home

651
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Here we go

652
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Quote from the book

653
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
The most impressive person I met

654
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Don Greg

655
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Don would go on

656
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
To become security advisor

657
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
To then vice president George Bush

658
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And ambassador to South Korea

659
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
When Bush became president

660
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Back then though

661
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Greg had just been reassigned to Washington

662
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
From Seoul

663
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Where he had been

664
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Where he had been

665
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Oh text removed

666
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I guess it was CIA chief

667
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm not sure

668
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
For most of two hours we talked

669
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
He described what it was like

670
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
To live overseas

671
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
For most of one's adult life

672
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
The isolation

673
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
The alienation from family and country

674
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
The physical hardship

675
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Just like it might be interested

676
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I get the feeling though

677
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Says Mike and he's from Melbourne

678
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
That Uncle Don might have gotten cold

679
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Feed about doing an interview on the DSC

680
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
If that's the case

681
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It's a bummer I was looking forward to hearing from him

682
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
No, not at all

683
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Believe me

684
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Uncle Don is now 78

685
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
As I said he's the CEO of the Korean Society

686
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
The Korea Society

687
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And he's very much involved

688
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And a lot of the world politics

689
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
They're taking place right now

690
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And he's become

691
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
He was always very outspoken

692
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
He tells great stories

693
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Because he does character voices

694
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And he can do

695
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
He does character voices

696
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Not only of

697
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Humanaries that you know

698
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
But also of ones that you don't

699
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Not necessarily know

700
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Like the Korean Ambassador

701
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Or South Korean President

702
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Just all kinds of

703
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Interesting stories that he's gotten

704
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I've listened to them all my life

705
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And now that he's 78

706
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And he's really kicking some ass

707
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And he's just taking no prisoners

708
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I told you that he

709
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
He as a Christmas card

710
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
There was a picture of him

711
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Aunt Meg who was his wife

712
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And I think the South Korean Ambassador

713
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And President George Bush

714
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
The senior

715
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And so it's beautiful

716
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Card and Christmas tree in the background

717
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
The whole thing

718
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
You know it's and they're all dressed up

719
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And they're Tuxedo's

720
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And he had sent that card

721
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Out as a Christmas card

722
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And wrote on it

723
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
The Good Bush

724
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
With a little arrow towards

725
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
George Bush senior

726
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And a lot of people didn't take that

727
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
They didn't take that very kindly

728
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
But that's the kind of guy he is

729
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
He's just screw it

730
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You know I'm just going to lay it out on the line

731
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
So he really does have something to say

732
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
He will open up

733
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
The problem is I just have to get to New York again

734
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
That's really the only issue

735
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
This is not something I want to do

736
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Want to phone call

737
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
This is something that

738
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It will take several episodes

739
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
To get through

740
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I'm sure

741
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And in fact I'm bum

742
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
That I don't live any closer

743
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Because I think I would rather go back

744
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Three times

745
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But it's coming

746
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Believe me

747
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It really is

748
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It's just a matter of coordinating

749
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And everyone being in the right

750
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Time with the right place

751
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So look forward to that

752
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And I'm definitely going to read the book

753
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Thanks Mike

754
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Appreciate the tip

755
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Adam, hi

756
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It's Paul Nichols here

757
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm supposed to be just giving you

758
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Some quick audio feedback

759
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Right

760
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
This is podcast ball from the UK

761
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
It's into a recent Charlie

762
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And I have this

763
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I've been British

764
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Particularly being English

765
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
That brings with a highly

766
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Creative cynicism

767
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
But what?

768
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Hold on a sec

769
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
That's just continue to listen

770
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You know

771
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Yes, I would have to say

772
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
If I've noticed anything

773
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
There is a certain amount of cynicism in the UK

774
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
About certain things

775
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Usually about the government

776
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And about

777
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You know, larger organization

778
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So

779
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm sure there's some cynicism

780
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
About me as well

781
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Let's hear what you have to say Paul

782
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
You mentioned previously about the podcast music network

783
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Only was

784
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Hold on, it's the pod

785
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You know, I hear this a lot

786
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It's the pod

787
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Safe

788
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Music network

789
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Not podcast

790
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Music network

791
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Not pod show music network

792
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's the pod safe music network

793
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
A common mistake

794
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
A bit concerned really

795
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Because I thought

796
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Oh, here we go

797
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
There's going to be a record label

798
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
The artist is going to lose that again

799
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
So I was absolutely

800
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Why do people always think that of me

801
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I'm your friend

802
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I'm not trying to

803
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You know, it's like, you know, we've talked about that roller coaster curve

804
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
When you're in the limelight

805
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And gosh, I wish fame and celebrity on every single one of you

806
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I feel like we're kind of in the upswing on the roller coaster

807
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Because people are starting to look a little bit further than what they read on

808
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You know, on a forum or a message board somewhere

809
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Or what they thought they heard

810
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
They're starting to think a little bit

811
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And they're starting to learn a little bit more about me

812
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And as you look a little bit further

813
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
You'll see that there's actually some good things we're trying to do

814
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So, you know, I think

815
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Paul, you probably tuned out and stopped listening to the show a long time ago

816
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
So you've missed a lot of the conversation

817
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I don't think a show goes by

818
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Where I'm not talking about this

819
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Because I'm very passionate about the pod safe music network

820
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It is an unlabel

821
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And I've been very clear that, you know, this is a community resource

822
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
That we're financing and so far we're really happy with the results

823
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Because all it's doing is making pod casting more fun

824
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Getting more creative people involved

825
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
All right, let's listen to the rest of your comment

826
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You've delighted to hear that the tracks we're going to start at

827
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
99 cents, which you say, I think a very good price

828
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And you're talking about nine cents or whatever

829
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Just covering administration costs

830
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
No, no, no, no, let me just discuss the

831
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Let me discuss that one more time

832
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Just so you understand

833
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
99 cents, we just chose that

834
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Because we feel that there's no reason to undervalue

835
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Any type of creative art, you know, so if something

836
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And iTunes is 99 cents and something else where is 79 cents

837
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I believe we believe, I must say at Pod Show

838
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
We truly believe that that only makes the other, you know, the 79 cents

839
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Seen like cheaper, therefore maybe not as good

840
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Because, you know, what really does it make?

841
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Does it make that much difference to a consumer?

842
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
79 or 99 cents? No, I don't think so

843
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So we didn't set the standard there

844
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
But I feel that it's important since, you know, we're trying to teach people

845
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
That there is another way of buying music and that you can buy music

846
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
That is unrestricted from how many copies you make

847
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And where you want to play it and what you want to do with it

848
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And you can always go back and download it again

849
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
The nine cents is not an administration fee

850
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It is the fee that is charged by clicking by

851
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
The cheapest one that can do worldwide

852
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Transactions for us and we did a lot of research on it

853
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And we're still working on being able to pay

854
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Through SMS, you know, cell phone text messages

855
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
But that's man, the operators get into there

856
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And they take 50 cents almost right off the top

857
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
So that nine cents is not administration

858
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
It is the cost of the transaction fee

859
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
There's another piece in there which we've only talked to

860
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I think we've touched on it briefly

861
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
If you sell to many foreign countries, unlike the US

862
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
On the US there's no tax, no sales tax on internet commerce

863
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
At least I think that's still pretty much true for the US

864
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
But there's value added tax or VAT if you were to buy it

865
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
For instance in the United Kingdom or many other European countries

866
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Which can be as high as 18 or even 20%

867
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So that VAT also has to come out of the 99 cents

868
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
We really believe that if a podcaster puts a link in their show notes

869
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Or if a listener, a fan of an artist puts a link on a website

870
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And someone clicks that and purchases the song

871
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Then that person should be entitled to a piece of the transaction

872
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Now here's what we've done and we're going to make that pretty high

873
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I think it's going to be at least 10%, maybe 15%

874
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
We really want to make it worthwhile

875
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
But that person will be able to choose to either take the money

876
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Or donate it to the artist

877
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And we're also working on a third donation

878
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Which could be to a good cause

879
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Maybe something like music cares

880
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
But that we still haven't figured out

881
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
But you will definitely be able to say, hey, I just want the artist to have this money

882
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I don't want any piece of it

883
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And the rest all goes to the artist

884
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
We're going to try this out for a year

885
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Which I think is the best thing to do

886
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Because you know who knows what's going to happen

887
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Pricing may need to change the world could change within a year

888
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
So for a year that's the way it's going to break down

889
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Podshow will take nothing

890
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
We feel is valuable enough to have people

891
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Coming into the Podsafe music network

892
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And being part of what we're doing

893
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And let's just see if we can see if we can make this work

894
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Let's see if people are really going to support independent music

895
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
In the manner that we believe they will

896
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So that's what it's going to be

897
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Got it?

898
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Get it?

899
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Good

900
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I'm working it all out

901
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And actually being very evangelical about saying this is for everybody

902
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I was really pleased to hear that

903
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I mean to say that without wanting to patronise or whatever

904
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
But really tough to hear about that

905
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Also I was a bit concerned that podcasters might

906
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
If you like the stopped from playing bits and pieces

907
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Because I don't know about you because

908
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
When I auditioned music I listened to I'm being serious now

909
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Probably 30, 40, maybe 50 tunes before I get that one

910
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And I auditioned it very carefully

911
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I want the musically integrity to be there

912
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And the production quality as well

913
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And I was thinking well if I'm going to spend 99 cents every single time

914
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
You know as a podcast producer too

915
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
But then I know these things that's mad

916
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Amazing where these things come from

917
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I've heard this before

918
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Someone said oh well you know curry's now turning this whole thing into

919
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
You got to pay as a podcast or to download it

920
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Where did that come from?

921
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Point me to where I said that

922
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
No there's the beauty of the pod save music

923
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Not work as it's creative people in pod casting

924
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Working with creative people in music for a common interest

925
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You know it's so never ever was there

926
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
A thought to charge podcasters for downloading music

927
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And of course there's one reason you know you would be paying

928
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
40 bucks to prepare your episode

929
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I think that what got confused is my shout out to

930
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
These licensing organizations such as

931
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Now in the UK they actually do have a license

932
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
The full license is not published yet as far as I know

933
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
But the basic high level details are

934
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And this works for both the performance

935
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Right as well as the mechanical so all your bases are covered

936
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I mean this is great because they are putting a license together

937
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Where you don't have to worry about someone else coming after you later

938
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
But they start off with like

939
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
12% of your gross revenue

940
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And I really would there's a lot of mainstream stuff

941
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I'd love to play you know as I've said many times

942
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I'd love to bring back the hit test

943
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Happy to finance it

944
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
But I'm not going to give up 12% of the gross revenue

945
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Of this program just know there's just no way

946
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
No freaking way

947
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Okay

948
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Obviously that's not the way it's pan down

949
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I'm really pleased about that

950
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And lastly just one very last thing now

951
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
You mentioned on your iPod that you had all 80s music

952
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Great so do I

953
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
You thought when I actually started I started off as the 80s podcast

954
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And then realized hang on a minute

955
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Things are going to get me in hot water here

956
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
What's a bit about that

957
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I'm actually looking at the MCPS and PRS Alliance license

958
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And I really want to see if I can if I can do that

959
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And I can place my stuff right along the side

960
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
The pod safe stuff

961
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
So there we go

962
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Anyway listen thanks for your time

963
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
All the best

964
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
By now

965
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
You know so I'm just hit me there

966
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Well I was thinking about it

967
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So my whole point was I would be happy to pay five

968
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Dollars to play one song

969
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Just one song one time license

970
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Let me play it and be done with it

971
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And I was just thinking wouldn't it be interesting

972
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
The 12% is just so incredibly high

973
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I mean that's just way too much money

974
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
From this show

975
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Of course pod show might be able to negotiate a much lower fee

976
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
For any podcast within the network that may be possible

977
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
But at the end of the day you just got to think

978
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
What am I willing to pay for the privilege

979
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
The privilege of promoting

980
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
This music

981
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Over which I have no influence really

982
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I have no direct contact with the artist

983
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You know

984
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I don't know

985
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
It's just I just feel it

986
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Whereas I would have been really really excited about a license like this

987
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
A year ago

988
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I'm just not that turned on anymore

989
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Hey there's a long it's actually it's a longer piece of feedback

990
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
But some fantastic information

991
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Because I put the call out about Mother's Day

992
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I only really got one or two email responses

993
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
But nothing

994
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Nothing as concise is what you're about to hear

995
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So if you wanted about the global Mother's Day

996
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
DeLema

997
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And wanted why it's not the same in every single country

998
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Your answers are coming up

999
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Hello

1000
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Hi Adam

1001
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It's Andy Taylor here

1002
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Andy

1003
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Just thought I'd drop you a quick line

1004
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
For a couple of reasons really

1005
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Firstly

1006
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
The discussion that's been going on regarding the Charlie

1007
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I found that quite interesting

1008
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Especially since

1009
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Over here in the UK

1010
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I'm not sure about elsewhere

1011
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
But Charlie is a slang term used for cocaine

1012
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And therefore

1013
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
When you say that you've enjoyed doing the Charlie

1014
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And that people are getting addicted to Charlie

1015
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Then

1016
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Yeah

1017
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Isn't this show like crack for you?

1018
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
To lead

1019
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Indicates or could indicate that people are getting addicted to cocaine

1020
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
To the Charlie

1021
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
To another

1022
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Explanation

1023
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
All right, get to the Mother's Day thing

1024
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Slime terms for the word

1025
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Charlie

1026
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
My name

1027
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Andy, come on

1028
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Second

1029
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
The

1030
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
History of Mother's Day

1031
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Was originally brought in as the Spring Festival

1032
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Which

1033
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Breaks and Rowans dedicated to the mother of their gods

1034
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And was then

1035
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Taken up by Christians

1036
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
To celebrate on the fourth Sunday in Lent

1037
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
In honor of Mary

1038
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
The mother of Christ

1039
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
And in England

1040
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
This whole day was expanded to include on with us

1041
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It was called Mothering Sunday

1042
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
On the fourth Sunday of Lent

1043
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Which of course is this coming Sunday

1044
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
26th of March

1045
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
In the United States however

1046
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
It was only about 150 years ago

1047
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
That it all started

1048
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
When a woman called Anna Jarvis

1049
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Organized the day to raise awareness

1050
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Poor health conditions in her community

1051
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And she thought that would be best

1052
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Advocated by mothers and she called it mother's work

1053
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Day

1054
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And it went on from there

1055
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And people then started observing

1056
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Mother's Day writing letters

1057
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Sending cars, presents, flowers, etc

1058
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And that's when mothers actually came from

1059
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
That day in America is celebrated on the second Sunday of May

1060
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
And that's also

1061
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
So that's this Sunday is the 14th of May

1062
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
And that's Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia

1063
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Holland, Iceland, Italy

1064
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norfolk, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, South Africa

1065
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I could go on the USA, of course

1066
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I have every single one of those countries on my

1067
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Frapper daily source code map

1068
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
But over here we like to be different

1069
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
And therefore we celebrate it on the 26th

1070
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
It's Roger Smalls calling

1071
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
March

1072
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Sorry about that

1073
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Now the other thing, the final thing

1074
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Before I say goodbye

1075
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Is about the court case

1076
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
And I'm sorry to

1077
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
This is really interesting

1078
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
You gotta listen to this guy

1079
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Because I don't know how he does some amazing research

1080
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
You heard about Mother's Day right

1081
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Now listen to the research he's done

1082
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
About the European Court

1083
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Which, of course, had supersede all local courts

1084
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Such as the one I went to and Amsterdam

1085
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
For the Creative Commons case

1086
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
But the distress that you've been put under

1087
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
And I'm actually studying for a devolved law

1088
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Course at the moment

1089
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And I found it quite interesting

1090
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
As I was reading through

1091
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
The European Convention of Human Rights

1092
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Which, of course, overrides as far as I'm aware

1093
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Any local jurisdiction

1094
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And there is a limited rights

1095
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
To write liberty and security

1096
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And qualified rights

1097
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Which are right to respect for private and fun lead life

1098
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Surely that comes in the yor

1099
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
No, no, no, no, no, no

1100
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
You know what?

1101
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I think you need to continue looking at the law

1102
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Because there is certainly in the United States

1103
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
But also this is kind of what the judge pulled on me

1104
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
In the Netherlands

1105
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
You do not have that right if you're an entertainer

1106
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
You're a fucking court jester with one of those freaky hats on

1107
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
You automatically give up that right

1108
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
That's why I say to people

1109
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I really wish you fame and notoriety

1110
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I really do because you'll see

1111
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
You give up that right

1112
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
But of course

1113
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And I've been through this rant before

1114
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
There's a trade-off for that

1115
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And there's a number of different types of rewards

1116
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
That make it worth it

1117
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Both social and economic

1118
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
But sorry

1119
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I do not know a country that does not treat celebrities differently

1120
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Which of course it's illegal

1121
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
But you know, hey there's celebrities

1122
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Fuck them

1123
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Area

1124
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
If not

1125
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
We have the data protection act

1126
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Where

1127
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
The rights of a data subject

1128
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Rights to prevention of processing

1129
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Lightly to cause damage or distress

1130
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Such as

1131
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Obseting your daughter

1132
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Sure with this or something to do with it

1133
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Well

1134
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Thank you very much for listening

1135
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And I look forward to

1136
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Coming on listening to your show

1137
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Oh, yeah, they need a promo at the very end

1138
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Yeah, that was kind of weird

1139
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Dude, you should just

1140
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Just mention it right

1141
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
That wasn't meant as a promo

1142
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I don't know

1143
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
For my show whatsoever

1144
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
But the promo in there

1145
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
If you wish to give me a plug

1146
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
You can do

1147
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I do

1148
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I do

1149
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Get to it

1150
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I should do a little plug for that

1151
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Guys full of information

1152
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
But oh man

1153
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Here we come

1154
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
So that's what I think

1155
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Anyway Adam

1156
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And if you want to hear any more

1157
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Interesting and amazing facts

1158
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Especially

1159
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I like

1160
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
About Mother's Day

1161
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And all sorts of other

1162
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Yeah, fantastic

1163
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Debates that go on

1164
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
You can visit my podcast

1165
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Which is the

1166
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Runtings of an old and

1167
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Blok podcast

1168
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
And the website is

1169
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
www.Runtings.ShortURl.com

1170
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Alright

1171
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Dude, thank you very much

1172
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I appreciate all the research

1173
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
You put into that

1174
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Very helpful

1175
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
You know

1176
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And it's too bad

1177
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
That we're in this

1178
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
The spiraling funk

1179
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
With comic strip blogger

1180
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Because there's a guy

1181
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Who I think actually knows

1182
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Quite a bit about European law

1183
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And

1184
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I don't know if we can pull him out

1185
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Of the place that he's in

1186
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Right now

1187
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
He wants me to apologize

1188
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Look

1189
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Comics are blogger

1190
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Let me say this

1191
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
You have to

1192
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
You really have to be careful

1193
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
About things you say

1194
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Because

1195
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I mean, listen

1196
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Just about the pod save

1197
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Music network conversation

1198
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
You know, I've never

1199
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Said that podcast

1200
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Or would have to doubt

1201
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And you'll pay for downloads

1202
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I've said quite the opposite

1203
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I've never said that it would be like a

1204
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Store

1205
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
In fact, I've said quite the opposite

1206
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Continuously and consistently

1207
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So people hear things

1208
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
The way they want to hear them

1209
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
And a lot of people heard your comment

1210
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And heard what I heard

1211
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
So I will

1212
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I will say that it's very possible

1213
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
And I think I even said

1214
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
When I played it, you know

1215
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Is this a language thing

1216
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Or I say that often

1217
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
About you comic strip blogger

1218
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Because

1219
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Sometimes

1220
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I even Patricia

1221
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
You know, she's not a native English speaker

1222
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
And her English is impeccable

1223
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
But sometimes things will come out

1224
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Very rude sounding

1225
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Almost just because of

1226
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
You know, the translation

1227
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
That's going on in her head

1228
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Between her native language

1229
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And the language that she's speaking

1230
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
But you have a knack

1231
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Of definitely

1232
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Talking about people

1233
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
In a certain way

1234
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
So whether you call

1235
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Ron Bloom my

1236
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Slavemaster

1237
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Or whether you feel it

1238
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Necessary to point out that he's Jewish

1239
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
You know, I don't know

1240
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Man, you really got to watch out

1241
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
With that shit

1242
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
So I didn't, by the way, call you

1243
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And anti-semite

1244
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I didn't call you a racist

1245
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
That I can recall

1246
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
At least I have to go back and listen

1247
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
But I think everyone agrees

1248
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
That you have to be careful

1249
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
With the words you're using

1250
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
You've got the stage my friend

1251
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
You do

1252
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Everyone's paying attention to you

1253
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And some people are very interested

1254
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And what you have to say

1255
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
My wife even said that she's

1256
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
She's starting to understand you

1257
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
And like what you're saying

1258
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
So you know, let's just reset everything

1259
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
All right

1260
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Yeah, because it's

1261
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
It will be fun to be able to continue

1262
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
A conversation with you

1263
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
But not when you keep

1264
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Yeah, it's just this tomb

1265
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Just look at what you're writing

1266
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
And it's abusive

1267
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I know you wanted

1268
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Don't want it to be called abusive

1269
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
You wanted to be called

1270
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Candid

1271
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Whatever, you know, stop it

1272
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
This particular community

1273
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Called the charles

1274
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
We don't

1275
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Just it's too much, man

1276
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
And dial it back a little bit

1277
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You're on eleven

1278
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Turn it back to five

1279
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Or something like that

1280
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
No, it'll be okay

1281
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Hey, let's play one more song

1282
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
For I get out of here

1283
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Speaking of Candid

1284
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
A lot of the language in this song

1285
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Is very Candid

1286
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Families, you are forewarned

1287
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Thank you for holding

1288
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Your call isn't wouldn't do us

1289
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Please stay on the line

1290
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
God damn it

1291
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I can never fucking talk to any real people

1292
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And these things

1293
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Please continue to hold

1294
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
To hold

1295
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
They have been holding

1296
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
For like two fucking hours

1297
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Cat suckers

1298
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
A customer service representative

1299
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Well, you should

1300
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Hold on

1301
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I'm fucking barely holding on

1302
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
A fucking sanity

1303
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I'm fucking fucking crack

1304
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
You got to do

1305
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Thank you for staying on the line

1306
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Please hold

1307
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Your call isn't important to us

1308
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I'm sorry

1309
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
But our offices are now closed

1310
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Please call back tomorrow

1311
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
What?

1312
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
What?

1313
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Closed

1314
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
It's fucking twelve thirty in the afternoon

1315
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Fucking you call

1316
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
God damn it

1317
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I love this cheap name Murphy

1318
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
He's got his own law

1319
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
If I ever see that cracker

1320
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I'm a jack of him in the jaw

1321
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Just when I think that shit is gonna get better

1322
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I get soaked in a million problems

1323
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Like a fucking bed wetter

1324
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I read a letter for the city

1325
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Saying I owe them some cash

1326
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
And with a splash landing in a sea

1327
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
If that was no stash

1328
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Don't laugh

1329
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Even though Murphy's probably laughing

1330
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
You knew all along

1331
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
That the shit would fucking happen

1332
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I don't know

1333
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
It doesn't work for sure

1334
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
That fucking law

1335
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Puzzass

1336
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And while he's at a special place

1337
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
To a plate of fucking glass

1338
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
You can see I don't like them

1339
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
He's always mistreating me

1340
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I playin' Murphy for the times right

1341
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
And a myth of feeding me

1342
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
He's cheating me

1343
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
How many people got they on law

1344
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
We're fucked up

1345
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
He ain't stopping DB from being wrong

1346
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
That's right

1347
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Come on man fuck that bitch

1348
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
DB is comin' through

1349
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Y'all's time to get rich

1350
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Something we're wrong

1351
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Must've been Murphy

1352
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Never tried to help me

1353
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Always trying to hurt me

1354
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Telling me I'm hungry

1355
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
When I'm only thirsty

1356
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Feelin' someone cursed me

1357
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Nasty

1358
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Something we're wrong

1359
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Must've been Murphy

1360
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Never tried to help me

1361
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Always trying to hurt me

1362
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Telling me I'm hungry

1363
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
When I'm only thirsty

1364
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Feelin' someone cursed me

1365
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Nasty

1366
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
In this world

1367
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
There's always an evil hand attempt

1368
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Like I gotta go

1369
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
A thousand miles on my tank

1370
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
So empty

1371
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Running all night

1372
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Trying to rob my rights

1373
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Just to roll the dice

1374
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
And I see Murphy again

1375
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
He's stopping my happiness

1376
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Letting sorrow come in

1377
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
To my girlfriend

1378
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Don't me and my fish dropped dead

1379
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I got fired

1380
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
From my job lost the feeling

1381
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
In my legs

1382
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
But that's just the life of sleazy

1383
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I got Murphy on my back

1384
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
And he ain't leaving me

1385
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
He's a dead eye shot

1386
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
When it comes to pain

1387
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Tragedy said this misfortune

1388
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
No one's got better rain

1389
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
But it's just the game

1390
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And it's always the same

1391
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Some days are good to see

1392
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Others are lame

1393
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
It's a shame that life had to be this way

1394
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Some smokey or we

1395
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
And drink young

1396
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Trains of family could die

1397
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Tomorrow some fuck

1398
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Who people think

1399
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Something we're wrong

1400
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Must've been Murphy

1401
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Never tried to help me

1402
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Always trying to hurt me

1403
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Telling me I'm hungry

1404
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
When I'm only thirsty

1405
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Feelin' someone cursed me

1406
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Nasty

1407
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Something we're wrong

1408
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Must've been Murphy

1409
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Never tried to help me

1410
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Always trying to hurt me

1411
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Telling me I'm hungry

1412
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
When I'm only thirsty

1413
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Feelin' someone cursed me

1414
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Nasty

1415
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Waitin' two hours

1416
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
For the boss like a bomb

1417
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
You decided to show

1418
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And then after you leave it comes

1419
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Like a car for a minute

1420
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Just they hit up the bank

1421
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And get a $40 ticket

1422
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
From office to bank

1423
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
If something can go wrong

1424
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
You know what fucking will

1425
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
The only way to fix it

1426
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Is bruised weed and pills

1427
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
It gives Murphy thrills

1428
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
It gives Murphy chills

1429
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
To see my mother

1430
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Fucking coffee table covered in bills

1431
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
But I've all let it bother me

1432
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
If I'm victim of a robbery

1433
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I lose the fucking lottery

1434
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Start crying

1435
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
It'll swab or eat

1436
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Cause I don't give a fuck

1437
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I look you right in the eye

1438
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
And say I'm ready to die

1439
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Now that last part was alive

1440
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
But we really need to stop

1441
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
We're eating about big Murphy

1442
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
To stop worrying about

1443
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
The rifles on our turn

1444
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
And that's it

1445
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
That's all I heard in a song

1446
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
D.B. coming through

1447
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And we break in Murphy's Law

1448
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Something we're wrong

1449
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Must've been Murphy

1450
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
If he never tried to help me

1451
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Always trying to hurt me

1452
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Tell him me I'm hungry

1453
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
When I'm only thirsty

1454
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Feel it someone cursed me

1455
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Nasty

1456
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Something we're wrong

1457
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Must've been Murphy

1458
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Never tried to help me

1459
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Always trying to hurt me

1460
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Tell him me I'm hungry

1461
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
When I'm only thirsty

1462
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Feel it someone cursed me

1463
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Not as only Murphy

1464
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
You know there's just aren't enough songs about Murphy's Law

1465
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
We all know what it is

1466
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
We've all witnessed the law

1467
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Where does it come from?

1468
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Andy that's something you can go research for us

1469
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
If you wouldn't mind

1470
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Was Murphy really a guy

1471
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Dislocated boner from California

1472
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
They got a whole bunch

1473
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
They got three pages of songs

1474
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
On the Podsave Music Network

1475
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Music.podshow.com

1476
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
One more thing I want to say before I go

1477
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
We've talked a bit about Heather and Janelle

1478
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Download with Heather and Janelle

1479
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Which is underwritten by

1480
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
AccuView contact lenses

1481
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
About that podcast

1482
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Well

1483
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Something must be going right

1484
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Because the show has been picked up for sponsorship for another period of time

1485
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I think it was six weeks

1486
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Something like that

1487
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
So it's like the sponsorship is continuing

1488
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Of that show

1489
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
And that would be against some of the wins

1490
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
So congratulations girls
