00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
portions of this podcast are brought to you by EarthLink Internet.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
$60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I guess it's a battle curry.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 309er.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hey, we're halfway through the week everybody.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Let's celebrate that properly.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let me go!

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Big story aside but true...

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You would believe you if only you would say goodbye

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Sit here on this break you've made

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Stair up the ocean in a haze

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Come bread and name alone

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Come bread and name alone

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
How are you and I

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
All hope are we?

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Walk as long as our rain

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm gonna talk about it, ain't it obvious that I need you?

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I need you.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And if you love me stay in town, with you here I'll stick around and to threats, don't matter.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:36,000
How you saw it in this way, too many dreams into many days,

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
After thoughts they made nothing.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, whoa, you could have told me,

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Now the days of summer, I guess much longer with you.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I always didn't believe it.

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Now I can't accept that the night's all longer since you've seen this through.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Don't wanna talk about it, ain't it obvious that I need you?

32
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now I can't accept that the night's all longer since you've seen this through.

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Now I can't accept that the night's all longer since you've seen this through.

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Now I can't accept that the night's all longer since you've seen this through.

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't wanna talk about it, ain't it obvious that I need you?

36
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I need you.

37
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Days of summer, now is now, I'm such a sucker for power cords and power vocals and choruses.

38
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So in the pod save music network, thanks to Kevin from firstperson show.net for sending me a link to them.

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If you took out the website as well, they've got a couple of videos.

40
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Hey everybody, how you doin' is Wednesday.

41
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We are halfway through the week, whether it's shit over here.

42
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
In preparation for my San Francisco voyage, hopin' on the oil rig for another couple of weeks.

43
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Patricia, hold on a second.

44
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But you should drag me to the hairdresser today, and I have a perfect coop emo at the moment.

45
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
My daughter is gonna be so proud which she sees in my hair, just like all the emo guys wear it.

46
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's see, got lots to talk about today.

47
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Interesting stuff that people basically emailed me. I'd love to get more of this stuff in audio comment form.

48
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'll see Patrick Mylander sent me a link to a German website, a page and a hoita.de, and he actually gave me a synopsis in English of what the page says.

49
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This is about what's going on in France. Apparently they're about to legalize file sharing, and from what I gather for a 7-year-of-fee, so about a box,

50
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
that'll be added to your monthly internet bill, the legalize copying of music and other media.

51
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Patrick, thank you very much for sending in that link. My Germans are a little rusty, but I was able to kind of get through it.

52
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Some other people sent me information about this.

53
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
If you know what's going on, and I know we have French podcasters tuned in, the pom pom pom pom pom pom podcast.

54
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Give us an audio feedback. Let us know what's happening over there, because that sounds pretty exciting.

55
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Another thing that a whole bunch of people have been emailing me about, this is something that, you know, if dig.com hasn't jumped on it yet, they certainly should.

56
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This is about the Coldplay CD. I don't know if you've heard about this, but the new Coldplay CD, which I believe is on Sony records. I'm loading up the page right now.

57
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Let me see, are they on Sony? Yes, they're on Sony.

58
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It comes with what we call a Yula, an EULA, the end user license agreement, and there's lots of information now on the net about this, but it's really, it's pretty funny. So this is insert.

59
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And they have pictures of it, and have actually listed out in plain text exactly what it says. I just want to run through some of these things.

60
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The most important part is the title. This CD is a copy protected CD, and it goes on to say, thank you very much for purchasing this CD in helping the cause of anti piracy.

61
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The recordings in this CD have an anti copying function. They cannot be copied into a PC.

62
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:39,000
In order for you to enjoy high quality music, we have added this special technology, so they add a little player, so you can play it if you want to roll it out on your PC.

63
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Listen to all of this stuff. Here's all the disclaimers. This is, it's exactly like the opening up a copy of Windows XP. You know, there's all the fine print that you just rip across, but by opening that you agree to the end user license agreement.

64
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Here we go. Some CD players that have the capability of burning into an MP3, such as portable players or car stereos. Oh, this is the list of devices that won't play the CD.

65
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Some players that possess CDR or RW functions. Some car stereos with satellite guidance systems. Some CD players or car stereos with hard disk recording capability. Some CDR RW recorders use from music.

66
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And it goes on. It won't work on some portable CD players. Some DVD players. Some CD LD convertible players. Some game players.

67
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's amazing.

68
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh, yeah, so they, they add this little application. Although you can use your Windows program to listen to certain tracks. This does not mean the CD can be played in all PCs.

69
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The first time this program is used in Windows automatic starter software gets registered in Windows file.

70
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Is that what they said? That's horrible English. Those programs already registered to not affect Windows. This is, that's not even English. That doesn't make sense. Anyway, the final one there is this CD does not support Macintosh PC software.

71
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Hey, why don't we just not buy it? Oh, it's going on. That's nuts, man. That's totally nuts.

72
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And then I'm sure, you know, we've getting more and more stories just pouring in about how wacky the RIA and affiliated organizations are. And a lot is coming. It's kind of bubbling up as to how they've been growing their market share, not by necessarily selling more records, but by taking money from other places such as

73
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
the story from Fradrico Avers.

74
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
According to my physician here in Belgium, he only plays classical music, which is royalty free in the waiting room.

75
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Because otherwise he has to pay the Belgian ASCAP equivalent.

76
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Is this how elevator music got started? Well, I don't know if that's, I guess it is true.

77
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Wait a minute, I know, wouldn't they technically, it depends on who the recording is of. I don't know. I guess maybe there.

78
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm trying to think if you'd have to pay ASCAP EMI in that.

79
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Anyway, doesn't matter, just some of the wacky things that's going on.

80
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I had a great conversation yesterday with Steve Gilmore of the Gilmore gang and Gilmore daily.

81
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And we were going to do, we actually wanted to do this before the New Year's, but he was sick and I had a lot going on by parents.

82
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And so we decided to do it in the New Year. We had a great conversation. I don't know 45 minutes or an hour.

83
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It was, I thought it would be a really good Gilmore daily. And I like having conversation with Steve because he can be such a dick.

84
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And I really get you fired up.

85
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And unfortunately, something went wrong with the recording on his end.

86
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I should have had the presence of mine to record my end of the conversation at least.

87
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But of course, didn't, so we're going to have to do it again.

88
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But we did talk about this Google PC. I don't know if you've heard about this.

89
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But the rumor is now out that Google is going to be launching a cheap PC.

90
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And we had this conversation. I thought, you know, the only reason I'd really care about a device like that

91
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
is not if it was 200 bucks or 100 bucks. But it was free.

92
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It was free and it returned for that.

93
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So what is it? It's a computer and it hooks up to the net and it gives you Gmail.

94
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And maybe it's some kind of online office, sweet stuff. You know, I could totally see that being something that in return for advertising in your attention is Gilmore would call it that that could be an offering.

95
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But anyway, the word is is that where the rumor is, the Google is going to announce something big at CES, the consumer electronics show in Vegas, which I'm just missing.

96
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I guess is it this week that it starts up or this weekend or something?

97
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I was supposed to be on a panel, but it just everything kind of worked out a little differently.

98
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And it's a bummer because the same time as CES is the adult video awards.

99
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And I had some connections to get in. So I'm bummed about that.

100
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Adam says Alan Wage is after being marooned in a non Howard Stern city in Atlanta, all my life.

101
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm anxiously awaiting January 9th when Howard goes on air at serious.

102
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I got hooked on him was spending a lot of time working in other cities during the past few years.

103
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I got my serious radio at best by last week in anticipation.

104
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I got me thinking though, once I start listening to Howard during my morning drive,

105
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
it's going to climb into my podcast listening time.

106
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So my plan is this morning drive, Stern afternoon drive, DSC, other podcasts on days when you don't do the DSC.

107
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Wow, I'm sure others are struggling with this dilemma. I love to hear your thoughts.

108
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Well, I think the good news about Howard Stern on serious is that he'll basically,

109
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I think the way it's going to work is the show will just be on a repeated loop.

110
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So very much the way it would work east coast, west coast.

111
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't know, yeah, he has three channels.

112
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So there's going to be some repetition.

113
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So you could listen to Howard whenever you want to, I guess.

114
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But I think he does work best in the morning quite honestly.

115
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And there is a lot of, and we talked about that yesterday as well.

116
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Gilmore and I did it. Well, we'll try and resurrect some of that conversation,

117
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
because actually I thought someone was pretty, pretty good, but it sucks man.

118
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I used to happen to Dave Winner and me a lot when we first doing trade secrets.

119
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And then, you know, the recording stuff wasn't quite fleshed out yet.

120
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And the backward freeze up and all the entire recording would be lost.

121
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And it just sucks. And then to pick up the thread, you know, sometimes you say,

122
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
forget it, we'll have to do it another day.

123
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Quite a conversation going on online here in the daily source code.

124
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And offline at the pod show office is about advertisers.

125
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And how we want to change what advertising is in this new type of media mashup.

126
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
In this particular version, which we call a podcast, not all of it.

127
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I will definitely be talking about stuff as we can bring stuff to the surface.

128
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Because, you know, we got advertisers involved in the conversation.

129
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So it's pretty exciting stuff, but we definitely definitely are working on changing what advertising is.

130
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And one of the ways we do that is through these subliminal senseo vulgon mind tricks.

131
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Greg Mason got a senseo machine with a gift card for the holidays.

132
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
He opened up the box, plugged it in, flushed the machine the next morning.

133
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
He says, I made a mug of coffee to my surprise.

134
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The coffee wasn't as good as I was hoping, but more alarming, I had zero froth.

135
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Oh my god.

136
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Well, you know, I don't know if the, you guys send this whole long email about not having any froth.

137
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Okay, I'm just going to tell you how I do it.

138
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
How I make my senseo coffee, because that does give me, it gives me good froth.

139
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So, usually the water tank is filled up.

140
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
If not, you got to do that first.

141
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And then, you know, you hit the on button so it can warm up.

142
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
In the meantime, you get your pod, you put that in.

143
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
After throwing out the old messy gunky wet one, right?

144
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Because of course, you never take that out right after you're done with the coffee.

145
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You leave it in there for the extra aroma.

146
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And then in your coffee cup, I put first sugar and then I put my milk in.

147
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And I put a liberal amount of milk.

148
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I like it that way.

149
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And then by then, the senseo machine is ready.

150
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I plop the, the coffee cup under a hit, a press play.

151
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And then it comes out and it does.

152
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And then when you stir, you know, put your spoon down in deep and make sure you're stirring

153
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
more near the bottom.

154
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And it's really frothy.

155
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It is. It's just fricking frothy.

156
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Hey Adam, Kevin Williams here from the middle management lobotomy podcast at mml podcast.lipsen.com.

157
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I listen with interest to Delta Sierra Charlie 307 and the idea of a senseo conspiracy.

158
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I am a fellow podcaster who has also heard your dulcet tone,

159
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
singing the praises of senseo.

160
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And as a result, added the senseo product to my Christmas list.

161
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Low and behold underneath the tree was my brand,

162
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
spanking new senseo machine.

163
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I could not tell you how excited I was to have the device open it up

164
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and try my first cup.

165
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And I do have to admit, it is very impressive.

166
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The dui eegbert's medium roast product that comes with the senseo machine is very tasty.

167
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And just the way it's manufactured is incredible.

168
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Now onto the conspiracy part, however.

169
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The concern I believe of the listener was that senseo,

170
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
in teaning up with dui eegbert's, has formed basically a monopoly on the coffee product itself.

171
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
In essence, the same thing as Dell making money one time off a piece of hardware

172
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and Microsoft making repeated money off of software sales

173
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
that are built into the same device.

174
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I would say it's slightly different with senseo.

175
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
In that if you do enough research, you'll find a number of coffee producers

176
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
that make pods for single cup brewing devices.

177
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Now they are not officially branded as senseo nor will they be,

178
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
because of the marketing deal that's senseo.

179
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And senseo, yes, senseo, I believe owns dui eegbert's.

180
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You'll find it on the senseo package.

181
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Have cut to work in tandem.

182
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
However, at least in my own local independent grosser association supermarket.

183
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yes, I use an independent grosser and not one of the big chains.

184
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I found not one, but two brands have produced single pods

185
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
that are available in those supermarkets.

186
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Maxwell House has their branded.

187
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm not sure of the exact name.

188
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Folders has created a branding called home cafe with single pods

189
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
that will fit the senseo machine just fine.

190
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Their French vanilla is very tasty out of a senseo machine.

191
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I've not tried their columbium roast or their regular house blend yet,

192
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
but we'll be going those to try in the future.

193
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Both those products sell for a price point lower than the dui eegbert's price.

194
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So if cost is a concern, yes, it is more expensive than buying a pound of ground coffee,

195
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
set for a standard paper filter.

196
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
However, I'm not wasting as much coffee and I have to think of the environmental impact

197
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
of the waste of the beverage and the water as well as the product itself.

198
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So I am one satisfied senseo owner and thrilled that you made the recommendation

199
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
as for a conspiracy.

200
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Check the web folks.

201
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You'll find plenty of coffee pod producers that make pods for single

202
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
cup brewers that will work just fine in your senseo machine.

203
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Thanks and appreciate the shout out.

204
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Take care.

205
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Bye bye.

206
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Kevin, so I'm really digging this conversation that we can have about products.

207
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't get paid for this senseo mentions.

208
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
We did get compensated for eye dog.

209
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I've got a lot of positive response on the eye dog stuff.

210
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And I'm wondering if maybe advertising on podcast is an ongoing conversation.

211
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Arguably, you're going to get more people try something out.

212
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:45,000
If they hear feedback both positive and negative, they're more inclined to check it out.

213
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And of course, that also depends on price point.

214
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You may not do that with a car, but certainly on a $50 coffee machine.

215
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So interesting.

216
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Thanks for the feedback on that.

217
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm still loving it.

218
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Still loving my senseo.

219
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You know how I love it?

220
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Because I don't have one in San Francisco at the condo, but for sure, I don't know why.

221
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
But she bought me a cup of chino maker.

222
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And although I do like the cup of chino, whenever I get home to the cottage, I was like,

223
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
oh yeah, there's my girl, there's my daughter.

224
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
There's my senseo machine.

225
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'll be there.

226
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Congratulations to Julie and Smith in over your head podcast celebrated his 100th episode recently.

227
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
CC Chapman, accident hash, same deal.

228
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh, I mean, that's what an achievement.

229
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
100 episodes. Congratulations, guys.

230
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That's fantastic.

231
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I wonder how I haven't spoken to Don and Drew in a long time.

232
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I wonder how they're doing.

233
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Actually, I saw the Drew is sent me an instant message the other day.

234
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And, but I missed him.

235
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
He was gone by the time I got back online.

236
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm going to see what my other girlfriend is up to.

237
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Quick mention, let me see.

238
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Hold on here.

239
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
About LibreVox.

240
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
There's actually a request coming in for people to say,

241
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
hey, I'd love it if if this book were available in audio book format.

242
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And you should definitely check out LibreVox.org.

243
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Just see what's going on over there because they got some really cool.

244
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And they've got, essentially, they've got open source audio books.

245
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Oh, sab.

246
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And nice acronym.

247
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So, two, uh, alto, I think.

248
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Uh.

249
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
He writes, you said on the show that you've chosen some works already to submit into LibreVox.

250
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Am I totally wrong if I wish that around the world 90 days might be one of them?

251
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Yeah, that's not one of them.

252
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
But that's a good one.

253
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Someone should definitely do that.

254
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And the two guys from Helsinki, Finland.

255
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Make sure you, uh, add a link to the Frapper map.

256
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Make sure you put your little flag in there.

257
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm a demon in the rack and throw.

258
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Plan 9 Rock Show.

259
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm a demon in the rack and throw.

260
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Choose a show that comes out of the chart.

261
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm a demon in the rack and throw.

262
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Jasper from the Plan 9 Rock Show.

263
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm a demon in the rack and throw.

264
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
That really might a cup of teasers and music goes.

265
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm a demon in the rack and throw.

266
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
The Plan 9 Rock Show.

267
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm a demon in the rack and throw.

268
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I don't know why it's because I've got enough of my new favorites.

269
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
So I'll probably be ripping Jasper's show off.

270
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Plan 9 Rock Show.

271
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Just rack.

273
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:49,720
Welcome to the Switchers Podcast, where we introduce Switchers.

274
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,160
You know, Switchers are full with those users that come forward on this platform, and now

275
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,760
only use the Apple OS and hardware.

276
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,760
Welcome, my dearest off-laping from the Switchers Podcast.

277
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,760
And as you both cast away into your comments, I forgot now I was going to edit this

278
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:25,760
piece because the whole promo is in Dutch, but the payoff actually kind of makes sense.

279
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,400
Let's start the new year right by learning how to go to college for free with the financial

280
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,880

00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,080
File your FAFSA, get a student loan, find a scholarship, and learn about the latest trends

284
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,920
and personal finance.

285
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:50,520
Did you know, for example, that US students in 2006 will face a 35% increase in their student

286
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,760
loan interest rates?

287
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,760
It's true.

288
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,760
Learn how to protect yourself from this by tuning into the financial aid podcast.

291
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,960
So this morning after I dropped Christina off at school, my phone rang, my blackberry,

292
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
and it was really weird.

293
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,520
It was like a bad Skype connection where the speech was all kind of drawn out, and it

294
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,520
was my dad.

295
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,240
He was calling me from the hospital, and as you probably know by now he had a TIA followed

296
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:32,840
by a minor stroke, and the outlook looks good, but he definitely asked to stay in the hospital

297
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,840
for at least another week and they started the rehabilitation process, and he now has

298
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:47,440
40% lost 40% of the use of his left side, and he was really weird because he's so

299
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,440
typical.

300
00:23:48,440 --> 00:24:02,800
He started talking about podcasting and about opportunities, and he had, it was really,

301
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,880
it wasn't what I expected at all.

302
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,480
Actually you know what, if you are listening to us right now on serious satellite stars

303
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,840
103, I'm sorry you're out of luck, we're going to continue this story on the podcast.

304
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,880
You'll have to go to dailysourceco.com to download it later on if you want to hear the rest

305
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,880
of the story.

306
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,880
Pacific Coast, Hellway, is up next for you guys, and I'll be back tomorrow right here on

307
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,400
the bird with y'all that everybody, and we're going to continue here with a conversation

308
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,440
about my dad, okay?

309
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:40,040
So it was, it's just us now, you know, I was like, you know, how are you doing?

310
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,000
He's like, well, he basically told me, but his speech was definitely, you know, not

311
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,040
slurred, but drawn out, and he was making sense, it was just really slow and exactly

312
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,440
what you'd expect from someone who, in that position.

313
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,000
But then he did something that he, that he's done before, you know, or always does,

314
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,320
really, starts talking about business and like, you know, dude, you shouldn't be worrying

315
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
about this.

316
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,320
He says, no, yeah, but I've, you know, I've got to survive, and like, yeah, well, of course

317
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,160
you've got to survive, so we've got to work on your health, but I think he was really

318
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:13,080
just talking about making money and business, and I couldn't believe it.

319
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:18,160
It was, it was surreal almost, and I kept saying it over and over and over, you know,

320
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,160
how are you, your health?

321
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,920
That's what's important.

322
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,040
And it was, anyway, it was a weird conversation.

323
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,160
He said something very, very cool, though.

324
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:32,280
Of course he, well, you know, he continued to talk about business, so, you know, I was listening.

325
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:39,520
He said, you're paving the goat path, I was like, what, he said you're paving the

326
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,040
goat path, and I asked him what that meant.

327
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:48,480
He said, look, you know, Howard Stern was able to, you know, cash in for 100 million

328
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:55,120
a year, and he measures everything in money, by the way, my dad.

329
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,240
But, you know, the, the possibility of this podcasting stuff is, you know, could, could

330
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:07,440
change everything, but not if you are out to, to pave the goat path, radio being the

331
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,440
goat path.

332
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,200
And I thought that was really prolific.

333
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,320
And, you know, and so I said to him, well, you know, that's exactly the way I feel about

334
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,320
it.

335
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,160
You know, there's so much more, and, and really it's about, in the, in the bottom layers of

336
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,520
it all, it's all about subscription, about publishing and subscribing to, to data, right

337
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,640
now we've learned how to, how to shuttle big pieces of, of audio around, but it's just

338
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,640
data.

339
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,840
So anyway, I said, you know, I didn't get much further with him, but he's doing okay, and

340
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:40,440
he's in rehabilitation, and he has to stop drinking, stop smoking, and exercise more and

341
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,160
take care of himself.

342
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:48,120
And, uh, I'll support him, however I can, but he definitely also has to stop worrying

343
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,080
about other shit, because that, that just can't help, you know, I think he needs to slow

344
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,080
down.

345
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,240
Okay, uh, a couple of things, let me see, oh, we actually have something really cool

346
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:05,240
coming up in a minute, uh, something that, uh, actually won't even work on, uh, on anything

347
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,240
but on headphones.

348
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,320
So if you've got some headphones, uh, you might want to grab them and, uh, jam, jam your

349
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,320
buds in now, um, coast, fun.

350
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:22,360
How to respond to, um, my, uh, parsing of weather, aviation weather, maytars and taffs.

351
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:27,000
Uh, he says, parsing maytars in any programming language, isn't as easy as it sounds.

352
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,040
I didn't mean to make it sound easy.

354
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,360
Since there are a lot of maytars standards, Jeremy Swadney started a purl parser for

355
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,360
maytars years ago.

356
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:39,280
Yeah, I've seen that actually, um, it's, uh, it was on, uh, there's a fresh meat project

357
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:47,160
page for it, uh, the GO maytars, that what it is, um, yeah, well, the service that I'm using,

358
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,040
I don't remember what it's called, uh, they seem to, maybe they're using a version of it.

359
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,040
That's very possible.

360
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:56,960
Let me see, what I use is, uh, so that's just, it enables me to put in the

361
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,760
aviation, uh, code for the airport that I'm looking for and it gives me the aviation

362
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
weather.

363
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
What is it?

364
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,200
TMG TMDG.co.uk interesting.

365
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,360
That's where that's where I get it from aviation information and weather, right?

366
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,360
Yeah.

367
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,760
www.tmdg.co.uk.

368
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,760
Okay.

369
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:22,800
So, um, I don't know if you've seen this thing, this, um, dig spy page, which to me is like

370
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:28,520
the ultimate aggregator if you're looking for, you know, slash dot type geeky type stuff.

371
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:33,360
It's, uh, an Ajax based web page and you, you put your browser on that page and it just

372
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,040
starts to scroll with just all these digs that are coming in of stories mainly technology

373
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,040
related.

374
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,840
And it's fantastic, you know, that is truly the river of news.

375
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,440
Um, and it's, and I like it because it's, you know, when I'm interested in tech news,

376
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,000
I can go there and it just kind of flows down my screen and I can click on something

377
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
when I think it's interesting.

378
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,880
I'd love to be able to have, you know, dig sites for all different types of topics.

379
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,440
I know that dig has categories and stuff, but it's still mainly a tech oriented community.

380
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:07,480
Um, but something, excuse me, I'm not even drinking this and say, I'm drinking tea.

381
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:13,240
Something that showed up multiple times is, uh, this Hallophonic MP3 sound.

382
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,960
Apparently, um, there's this file done by, uh, uh, a company and out there, I think, in

383
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:25,560
Switzerland, that has made a Hallophonic sound embedded into an MP3.

384
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,360
I don't know if there's any technology behind it.

385
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,920
I was, you know, I was rushed and too lazy to figure it out, but I figured we would

386
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,120
listen to their example file together.

387
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,720
It's supposed to give a complete spatial effect.

388
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,120
Um, so you can even hear sound above and below you.

389
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,200
So I have not listened to this myself yet.

390
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,880
Let's just listen in.

391
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:53,880
Okay, good, good left and right separation.

392
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:03,320
There you go.

393
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,920
The matches flew over my head.

394
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:15,160
That was kind of cool.

395
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:30,480
Cool, that way, I'll be over here, well, the guy with the matches comes back this way,

396
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,880
we're in across each other in the middle, come on, come on over here.

397
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:47,120
Okay, stay over there if you want.

398
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:55,480
Okay, if you're going to walk that way, I'm going to step over here.

399
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,320
Okay, okay, it's driving me nuts.

400
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,600
Yeah, my God.

401
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,520
Uh, all right, where are we, pod safe music video stuff?

402
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:11,880
Oh, yeah, apparently this kind of sucks, apparently there was a video was made of pod safe

403
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:19,800
for peace, but I guess it didn't work out, you know, and the reasons being that it all

404
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,360
had to be worked out was slow in Orlando who wrote the song, which is, of course, you

405
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:31,880
know, when I said, hey, you know, I'm looking for people to start creating music videos

406
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:39,000
of pod safe music, maybe I should clarify that, this all does become a part of the unlabel

407
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,280
if you will, which we've talked about before.

408
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,960
What I think will happen, or what we're actually, you know, designing and building right

409
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:53,720
now is let's say you're a video maker, a music video maker, you'll just call yourself

410
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,880
that, pod safe music video person.

411
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,480
I believe that there should be able to, you know, we should be able to come to an agreement

412
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:07,720
between artists and the pod safe music video makers, so that you can, you, you can basically

413
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:13,440
put images, synchronize images to their soundtrack.

414
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,080
And the entire point being that you would have an affiliate and an affiliation with that

415
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,520
artist, so that when someone watched the video, the concept is, of course, they will want

416
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,520
to go and buy something from that artist.

417
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:33,400
And just like Amazon, you would click into their store or whatever, and you'd get referral

418
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
fees.

419
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,200
And I think that that's part of what the unlabel is going to look like.

420
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,560
Everybody should be able to have a record label because what is a record label?

421
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,960
It is promotion.

422
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,000
Now that we know the technology is not important.

423
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,040
Of course, you know, the record labels have an art department and they can connect writers

424
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,280
with these musicians.

425
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:59,000
You know, that's, that's really when you're trying to, you know, you, that's like a laboratory.

426
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,720
I don't believe too much in that, I think it's much better to have a community of people

427
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,760
who hang out and meet each other, which, of course, the pod safe music networks should

428
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:13,400
also turn into that if we put some, like, forums and stuff, but there are ways to make

429
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,400
this work.

430
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,840
And at the end of the day, I think everyone will be able to benefit.

431
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,120
So, I don't know, just brain farting here.

432
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,120
What's this?

433
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,560
That's a video feedback which I want to share with you.

434
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,560
You won't be able to watch the video, but the audio will be sufficient.

435
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:31,600
So, Guy and his kitchen, and in the background, a sense out.

436
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,080
And this is a response to the endless source of throughout the 6th and seems to about

437
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,160
a port safe music, let's give him some cues.

438
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:49,400
You've spoken about video drivers making videos for artists.

439
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:56,600
Well, I got into folk broadcasting for the other way around, I needed some music to go with

440
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,440
my skateboard videos.

441
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:06,160
So, I want to join you, the pod safe music network, and see if you need your feet.

442
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:13,160
I just started my own feet, got my own domain name and name, what a good way to start

443
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,840
2,000 to 6th.

444
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:24,480
So, if I can help some artists with names on video, I'm very glad to do so.

445
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,880
Now he's making a couple of sense sails, nice close up with a machine.

446
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:41,960
You can find the more info about my video project on www.yolo.com.

447
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:49,120
Cheers, and people to do the work in 2006.

448
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:55,840
Music I use is MinWitDrop from Bang Out Production, which I found the pod safe music network.

449
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,480
So that's YoDo.com, J-O-H-D-O.com.

450
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,800
So that's exactly what I was talking about.

451
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,960
He wants to help out artists by making cool music videos.

452
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,480
I think he should be able to do that, and yeah, I told you that people who are working

453
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,800
really hard between Christmas and New Year's, not includes work on the pod safe music

454
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,960
network to get the sails generation.

455
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,320
Thank you, by the way, for all the feedback you've given about means of payment, I can

456
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,000
tell you now that we definitely want to use multiple forms of payment.

457
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,640
So cell phone will be one way, would of course a credit card or PayPal will be another way

458
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,360
to purchase from the pod safe music network.

459
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:38,280
Working on the licenses, the agreements that the artists, because they'll be able to

460
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,840
opt in whether they want to sell or not, they won't be obliged to sell.

461
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,600
We have to put in some technology for that preference, they say, you know, make this track

462
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:52,800
available for sale, all of that stuff, and it's a lot of work really is.

463
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,880
I think that as I said, you know, going out to San Francisco, this coming weekend will

464
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,280
be testing in the next week.

465
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,840
So, well, hopefully we'll see some features come online in about 14 days.

466
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:08,280
Hey Adam, this is Sean J from Shakespeare Cast, calling actually for a couple of reasons

467
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,280
one.

468
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,000
I'm trying out this whole listening to your broad cast and having an idea and popping out

469
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,240
my eye talk and popping it on there and leaving a comment, so we'll see if that works.

470
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,760
But the second reason I'm actually calling the main reason is that behind schedule on

471
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,560
you, I'm listening to 303 right now.

472
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:31,560
And you were talking about some more of the, you know, pay-per-song stuff on a pod show, music

473
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
network.

474
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:39,560
And I got this idea, if there's a way that you could set it up to have people who are

475
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:44,880
purchasing, let you know which podcast they heard the song on or that referred them

476
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,880
there.

477
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,200
That would be just another thing, a way to collect data as far as, you know, where people

478
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,160
are here in the tunes and who's recommending them and that kind of thing.

479
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,160
We only do one song in episode, just kind of tagged on at the end there and it's mostly

480
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,440
the popular stuff that you guys are playing.

481
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:07,200
But I thought, God, how cool would it be for people to know exactly where these revenues

482
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,320
coming from, you know, accident ashes is drawing so many listeners to purchase this song

483
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,160
or your show, et cetera, et cetera.

484
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,680
And then you could even throw, you know, maybe a penny per purchase to that podcast.

485
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,480
And you could do it all, you know, we have to be registered with the Pod Safe Music

486
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,480
Network.

487
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,480
So we've already got accounts.

488
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,480
So you could just link it up that way.

489
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,560
Of course, that means that money for you to buy a new guy.

490
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,240
Oh, sorry about that.

491
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,080
The hell was that all about?

492
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:44,080
Sometimes when Mac does that, it goes into this audio loop for no reason.

493
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,680
This is something I noticed with this new power book ever since I got it.

494
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,320
It hasn't happened in a long time.

495
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,480
Anyway, I think it was really clear what he was saying.

496
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,560
Brilliant minds, think like, there you go.

497
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,480
It's exactly what it is.

498
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,080
It's a referral program and I think it will work that way.

499
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,960
And I think, in this case, we have a basis product which is a music which people are

500
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:11,280
used to paying for and artists are also used to understand that there's a chain, a sales

501
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:18,680
chain and if we do it based upon the principles of Amazon, you know, there's an affiliate

502
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,680
relationship.

503
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,440
All of that stuff comes into play and I think everyone, as I said, everybody can benefit

504
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,280
and listeners should be able to do that as well.

505
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:31,160
And the way you do this is by creating a network.

506
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:36,880
And the network means that, you know, we all agree to certain things and obviously with

507
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,240
any network, I'm going to be involved in there's going to be a great amount of control

508
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,200
if not actually I should say this one thing we've always stood for is I don't care what

509
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,480
you're doing on your podcast as long as you're keeping your audience growing your audience

510
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:57,840
and having a damn good time, a skipy good time, a CC which it would say.

511
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,840
But that's what it is.

512
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:03,040
It's putting a network together and the network includes parties who all have some

513
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:09,840
equal say in this and it's the creative people who are consuming at the same time.

514
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:16,640
It's listeners, viewers, readers and there's also people who want to market and advertise

515
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,840
to these groups and we have to have this dialogue ongoing to figure out how we put it

516
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,840
together.

517
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,120
I tell you what, you know, people listening to this show, you've been really vocal.

518
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:31,720
You really help me make a case towards some major advertisers about how we talk about

519
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,320
products and how we sell products and even if we're interested in selling products.

520
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,840
So it's been great and I really appreciate it.

521
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,840
And this was a big hit.

522
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:45,440
On the other night, when I drove, when I picked up Christina from a party and drove her

523
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,360
friend of hers home, I cranked this one up in the shaggy one.

524
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:57,120
Farts are so fragile, they're fashioned from gas, why must we squeeze just to help them

525
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,120
to pass?

526
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:06,520
If parts are so strong once they break in the air, they're a shall-bye away, over a room to get

527
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,520
cleared.

528
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:15,080
But, Farts were made out of super ball stuff, they bounced right back when they fell

529
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:23,180
from your butt, they keep that sense of the smell would be rough, if Farts were made

530
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:29,640
out of super ball stuff.

531
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:36,480
Farts are so friendly, they follow your tail, although we can't see them, they leave.

532
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:43,920
They leave quite a trail, Farts are in color, they're so hard to find, they're so fun

533
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:51,480
to light, as they leave, you'll be hiding, but if Farts were made out of super ball stuff,

534
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:59,440
they bounced right back when they fell from your butt, they keep that sense of the smell

535
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:06,440
would be rough, if Farts were made out of super ball stuff.

536
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:16,440
Just imagine the free time, it's always they would be in my pocket, I'd keep on the

537
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:24,120
throw at your feet, if Farts were made out of super ball stuff, they bounced right

538
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:32,800
back when they fell from your butt, they keep that sense of the smell would be rough, if Farts

539
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:41,800
were made out of super ball stuff, if Farts were made out of super ball stuff, they bounced

540
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:50,200
right back when they fell from your butt, they keep that sense of the smell would be rough,

541
00:41:50,200 --> 00:42:02,760
if Farts were made out of super ball stuff, if Farts were made out of super ball stuff, they

542
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:18,760
can understand that teenage girls were totally into this, right?

543
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:26,400
Cookie Cutter Girl, aka Lynn Julian, if Farts were made out of super ball stuff, that's it for

544
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,920
today's Daily Source Code, I'll be back tomorrow, and then we wind up the week just before I
