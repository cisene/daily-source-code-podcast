Delta Sierra Charlie 3-4-9er

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hey Adam, this is Richard Hull. Don't forget to turn off that black pre-before-start recording today. Bye for now.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,000
She sat, she sat, she sat, she sat, she sat, she sat, my girl got it so long.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There's never been simple air, there's never been short content.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Won't help me see bad night, no, no, no, no.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
She sat, she sat, she sat, she sat, she sat, she sat, she sat, she sat, my girl got it so long.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The neighbor's been, I've seen her watching you, I've seen those bolder fingers twitching in that net.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
There's never been no, no, no, no.

9
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,500
Ain't you still yet?

10
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Oh, huh.

11
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,700
He used to days, he sideways.

12
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,400
He threatened me of all gone.

13
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,900
I'm not disding, he was so low.

14
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:28,900
Now who is it gonna come in?

15
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,900
He sat, she sat, and she sat, she sat.

16
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,000
She sat, she sat, I don't get what she said.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
There's never been a wrong way

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
There are no easy answers

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't make my own mistakes

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He used to take things away

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
He said, you tricked me of alcohol

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I've decided so well

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Now prison from here

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He used to take things away

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He said, you tricked me of alcohol

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I've decided so well

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Now prison from here

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He said, you tricked me of alcohol

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Now prison from here

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Now prison from here

32

Now prison from here

00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Now prison from here

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's too late, it's all the way, it's late

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's with me, I'm alone, I'm a city, I saw the world

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's now a reason for everything, I'm a real just for it

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm a real just for it, I'm a real just for it

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm a real just for it, I'm a real just for it

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Hey!

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Oh, a gravity, risen from the Podship Music Network

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Everybody how you doing welcome to the

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Early source code coming to you once again from the

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Curry Cottage in the Fabulous UK

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You know, I've noticed a lot of commenters lately have been from the UK

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This, um, hey gravity is also from the UK

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What are they?

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
A two-girl three-boy dynamic UK-based guitar band

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Fronted by Electric Shomtoos singer Justin Barry

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Very cool, check it out at music.podshow.com

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What is it?

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What is it?

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't know

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I've all kinds of sound issues here today

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Sometimes I just wonder if it's my head if it's my brain or my ears or whatever it is

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Not a nice day today

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's raining

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah, just, you know, nasties, pouring down rain, dark outside

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Not really good other than to sit inside and record a podcast

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And man, I've been so busy doing things

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Oh, um, also a video music cast coming up

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I think I'll put one together today

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I've been receiving material from all around the world

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Looking for great music videos

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Podsafe, of course

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I've received play that aren't podsafe

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And also some fun things I'm going to stick in there

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So be on the lookout for that to show up in your aggregator and your pod catcher and your iTunes

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Or whatever you may be using

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Go to dailysourceco.com

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And click on the link for, you know, it says direct link to show

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Just click on it starts playing, so it's a beautiful thing

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Uh, let me see

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let's start off with

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This is the first complaint I've actually heard

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
About the use of the word the Charlie for the source code

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Of course the genesis of this is the daily source code

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Uh, I started tagging my podcast, which makes it much much easier for people listening on iPods

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And especially not even iPods

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Um, on devices that don't even have a display or a proper display or if you're driving

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And you just, you know, hit the play button

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And you can hear exactly what show it is

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And you kind of remember which show you listened to last

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And that became a bit tiresome

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So I changed it to DSC and then I changed it to Delta Sierra Charlie

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And um, I didn't come up with this Charlie thing

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And someone actually called it Cha Cha the other day, which is quite frightening

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Uh, Mr. Carcran has other thoughts about that

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hi Adam Chris Carcran here from the car cast

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Just wanted to send you a little piece of feedback

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And ask you a question

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And I've never asked you to change anything about your show

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I would not even pretend to know as much about programming a podcast as you do

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But I gotta make this request

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Lately, you and your listeners have started calling the daily source code the Charlie

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Just wanted to maybe we could stop using the phrase the Charlie

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And the reason is as I'm a 32 year old man

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I've been in broadcasting for 10 years

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Now I'm doing podcasting exclusively

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And uh, I'm

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No pansy

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
As a child

121
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
My mom used the word Charlie for something other than someone's name

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
In fact

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That's a nickname my mom gave a male penis

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If a time I was a little kid until probably about the fourth grade

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
All I knew I never knew the word penis

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Hold on, did you say male penis?

127
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
As opposed to female

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Female penis?

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We just called it a Charlie

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So you can imagine the way that I feel and the

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Repulsion I feel every time I hear someone say

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Talk to you on the Charlie

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Or

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I heard on the Charlie

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Or

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Catch you on the Charlie

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I just I can't do it anymore

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So just wondering is a suggestion

139
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And if you say no I'll understand of course I'll keep listening

140
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But I'm sorry to go that out to you

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Thanks for doing what you do and of course if you're listeners want to check us out

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
They can't at thecarcast.com

143
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Or they can search out an iTunes

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Just search for the carcast

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Thanks Adam and talk to you soon

146
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yo dude

147
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So that's kind of weird

148
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm older than you are

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Almost ten years older than you are

150
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And I grew up my parents are really specific you know

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's a penis. It's a vagina

152
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And this is what it's called you know like an arm or a leg or whatever

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
This is oh this pure I presume you're from the US

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Very pure a technical

155
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I oh I despise that so much

156
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You know not calling things by the proper name

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Your PP your thing your wing

158
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's just a penis and by the way

159
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm very proud of my penis

160
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I like my penis

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
How can you be freaked out when someone talks about penis?

162
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Come on man, it's been there for a number of years

163
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And I've kind of figured out how to use it

164
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And I'm getting pretty good at that actually

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So so Patricia tells me I'm improving

166
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But no no no please parents

167
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Just call it by its proper name

168
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
My gosh, you know they'll learn how to what other names are easier and sound better later on in life

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But come on tell them what it's for tell them what it does tell them what it's called

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And I appreciate the feedback

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But that's just not enough to change the change

172
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Using the phrase to Charlie

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The pod show podcast network is really coming together

174
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
We have a whole bunch of beta tester podcasters

175
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Who are actually using the system in two parts

176
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
They're using the the upload functionality

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And our de-gap dynamically generated audio placement system

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
For their uploads most of them are using their own wordpress web logs or wordpress web logs that we've set up

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Which of course will not be the final solution we have a whole show site that is automatically created

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And adapted with every single upload

181
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's become very very easy and had a brief email exchange with cast blaster mic this morning

182
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Looks like we're down to the wire here on integrating cast blaster

183
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Which is the program I'm using

184
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You can find that at castblaster.com

185
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's really really really simple

186
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And when it integrates with the PDN, yesterday by the way

187
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You might have seen a really strange URL for the

188
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
For the Charlie

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
On 348

190
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That was because I tested the de-gap and PDN system myself yesterday for the first time

191
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And it held together

192
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I did get some one piece of feedback about something in the ID three tags being wrong

193
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm not quite sure what that was about but I'm getting screenshots

194
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And we'll have more feedback on ID three tags later on in today's source code

195
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But what's really cool is we have a number of people

196
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Predominantly I'd have to say Richard Brue were hey

197
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Who really does all of the he manages all the relationships with the podcasters

198
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And you know and delegate stuff for escalate stuff

199
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Whatever has to be done

200
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But he's really the main point of contact

201
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
He's doing it such a great job and you can see how

202
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And they have wiki set up and mailing list and god

203
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't know all kinds of stuff

204
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And people start to communicate and figuring out how to get stuff across the network

205
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
We're learning how to schedule things and Jay Donnelly is one of these guys

206
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Who really gets it and he's doing some incredible stuff

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Since he joined the net actually's been doing lots of incredible stuff

208
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But since he joined the network he's coming up with more and more

209
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Including some very interesting

210
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Super celebrity interviews

211
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And that was a cue to start

212
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
There we go

213
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Hey this is Jay Donnelly from madpod.com

214
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And on this week show we have an exclusive interview with Thomas Dolby

215
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Shadow has an exclusive interview with the man blinded by science

216
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And he talks about the future is podcasting

217
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Thomas what's your take on top 40 radio these days

218
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Compared with 20 years ago

219
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't listen to top 40 radio these days

220
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So I'm really not qualified to answer that

221
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But it doesn't really appeal to me

222
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You know I don't listen to very much of it

223
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Occasionally I hear a hit that I like

224
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Occasionally I'll focus on just one piece of a song

225
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You know like I don't know

226
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Personally that's not where I look for inspiration

227
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I look for inspiration on the satellite radio now

228
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Which I think is much more varied

229
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
On internet radio stations and podcasting

230
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What it becomes a collective program from Santa Monica

231
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'll podcast that and take it to the gym with me

232
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So you know I tend to reach a little bit further in

233
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
than standard top 40 radio

234
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
20 years ago I wouldn't say you know radio had a white night

235
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'd say that already radio was in a state where

236
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You know computer generated playlists were starting to dominate

237
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You know it was all about keeping up with the front runners

238
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It was all about the the ads and the rotation and so on

239
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
DJs were not really choosing their own songs

240
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You didn't get a sense of you know a single guiding intelligence behind the playlists

241
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It felt like big corporations were already involved

242
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I know a lot of people complain about how it's become consolidated

243
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You know by a few big companies now

244
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And that's certainly I don't think it's a good thing for radio

245
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You're global audio internet connection

246
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
J. A. Domali and Shadows to you

247
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Mad

248
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Don't get mad

249
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Get media

250
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Mad

251
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Coming up this weekend on madpot.com

252
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yo excellente

253
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It was something else that was going to happen today

254
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What the hell was it?

255
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I was um as I was playing that

256
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
J. Domali clip I was thinking

257
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I've been sleeping really really deeply

258
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Maybe that's it

259
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Maybe I'm not awake yet. It'll come to me. I'm sure

260
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Um more pod save music on the way in today's show

261
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And quite an interesting conversation about ID three tags that we started

262
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Just the other day

263
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Predominantly as it pertains to the pod save music network

264
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And I just want to reiterate the pod save music network is a network

265
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's not a store. It's not necessarily a website

266
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's a network where people come together

267
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Where they contribute where they you know contribute karma

268
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
They take away karma. They report back karma

269
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Um and you know and this is really intended because it doesn't make sense to have

270
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
A real central resource because we have that

271
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You know it's called iTunes and and and all that stuff

272
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You know you get what you want

273
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Um and they have tons of people working on that

274
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Well tons I mean I think the iTunes team of course by you know

275
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Relatively speaking is small but still you have to have four or five people

276
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Working on stuff and making sure everything you know works perfectly

277
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And that would either mean tremendous scale to be able to afford it

278
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Um or price fixing which is another thing that is being talked about quite a bit

279
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
lately

280
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Um

281
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Well let's see what this particular piece of feedback is about because it does pertain to all of us

282
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Whether you're a listener, a podcaster or an independent artist who wants to contribute to the network

283
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Hey Adam Dave Jacobs from the rock and roll Jew show, rock and roll, Jew.com

284
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I want to disagree with you on the ID3 tags and the pod save music network deal

285
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Uh as a music podcaster I also have had frustrations in downloading tracks

286
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Not just from pod save music network but all kinds of other places on the net

287
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And they sometimes will come down with no MP3 tags or really messed up MP3 tags

288
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It really does make things a lot more difficult for the podcaster

289
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And I can imagine for the music producer as well

290
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Who's even less forgiving than a podcaster

291
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Now you can say hey you know this is the store

292
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's up to the bands and if it's all messed up

293
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
People just won't buy from those bands anymore

294
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Unfortunately I think if you really step back and look at it from a customer perspective

295
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's just not what they're going to think

296
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The customer really doesn't know nor do they care that it's up to the bands do this

297
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And is not pod shows responsibility

298
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
They don't know nor do they care that you're not trying to run a store

299
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
All they know is hey there's cool music on this thing and I want to buy it

300
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And when I buy it I want to get it and when I get it I want it to be right

301
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Period and if it's not right again

302
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
They don't know who's in charge

303
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
They're just going to come straight back to you

304
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And that's going to be a real problem for pod show

305
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
When people download music and something's not right with it

306
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
They're going to come straight back to you

307
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
They're not going to go to the band and say hey I download one of your tracks

308
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And it's all messed up

309
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No they're going to come straight back to the pod and say

310
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Music network owner because you are you know the face of the whole thing

311
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So I think you really have to think about it from that perspective

312
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And realize that you might end up with a big customer service problem

313
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Whether you like it or not because in the mind of the consumer

314
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That's just the way they're going to approach this

315
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Even though you might like it to be somewhat different

316
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So I don't know what the solution is

317
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm sure there's some sort of a technology thing that can be worked to make it better

318
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And I will as a podcaster and music consumer put the shout out to all bands

319
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Hey guys

320
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Really be careful with your MP3 tags

321
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Take the time to do it right and make sure that it's good

322
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Because when people download this stuff you want it to be right

323
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It just makes for a better experience for everybody

324
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And that's it

325
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Talk to you later

326
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Bye bye

327
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Well I'm going to respectfully disagree with you

328
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
They are first of all you're talking about customers

329
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
These are not pod shows customers

330
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
These are customers of the bands

331
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Okay

332
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So you know if we're going to provide customer service

333
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Well then we have to stand for some form of service

334
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The show was really trying to be a resource in this by providing the resources to pull it all together

335
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And have a central place where commerce can take place

336
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
But also people should be able to get in contact with the bands

337
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That's all coming it as we revamp the pod state music network

338
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's all part of the grand master plan

339
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Oh I remember today when's that?

340
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yes, I do remember

341
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I believe today Rob Wall should podcast 411

342
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Has an interview with myself Ron Bloom and Bill Reinhard from

343
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Limelight networks we're talking about the pdn

344
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
So make sure you check that out

345
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I haven't seen it show up yet

346
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
But I believe it's today it's being released

347
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So back to this

348
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And also I don't believe that people by the way

349
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
If people do all of a sudden just start showing up

350
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
At the pod save music network and saying

351
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Unlistening and you know cruising through songs

352
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And listening to them and saying here something cool all by it

353
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I would be surprised

354
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And if we get to that point where people come in

355
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Drows will then we will have to rethink the strategy perhaps

356
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Or work with the other partners which are podcasters

357
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And are independent artists

358
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
On coming up with better solutions

359
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But for my money

360
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I see every single independent artist or band

361
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
As their own mini corporation

362
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And they don't need a record company for promotion

363
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Or for support

364
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Because you know it's pretty

365
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Cost effective these days to record your own music

366
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And the only people really involved are the the listen of the podcaster

367
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And the artists but they are working together

368
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What's been happening so far is

369
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
People here are song on a podcast

370
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
They go to show notes or they go directly to the pod save music network

371
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Sometimes directly to the artist's site

372
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's all good to me

373
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And that's where they should be able to find out more information

374
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Now as a corporation

375
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It is the responsibility of the person

376
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Actually pod show is not selling anything

377
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The artists are selling this

378
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
We're just making it all possible

379
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And by keeping the overhead as low as possible

380
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Right now as you know as we enter into our beta period

381
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And a couple of songs are available on the network

382
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
We're not taking any cut

383
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's a nine cents that goes to our partner

384
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
For doing the transaction

385
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And the rest goes directly to the artist

386
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And in the future we want to split that up

387
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
As the unlabel concept starts to expand

388
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And snap together

389
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Once we have those freaking emails worked out

390
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So we can actually sign people up properly

391
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
We're getting very close

392
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Once we have that done

393
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Then

394
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I lost my train of thought

395
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Screw it

396
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
My point is it is up to the band

397
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Or the artist

398
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
They are responsible for that

399
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Now there are some things we couldn't put

400
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
We can put in place that I thought of

401
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
While listening to your comment before I start to do the show today

402
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
One is of course

403
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
When you upload something

404
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And I don't have an artist account

405
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So I actually have to check into this

406
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The first thing that we can have is all kinds of flags

407
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And warnings that say please enter your ID

408
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Three information is important

409
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Then we could have a version of

410
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I guess we could have some kind of checker

411
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That once a file is uploaded it checks for ID

412
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Three tags

413
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But maybe the best way to do this

414
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Is something like the CD database

415
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I've always loved that concept

416
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And I'm sure it still exists

417
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And maybe we can tie into it

418
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Or let's just create our own for pod safe music

419
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And if you've ever seen how that works

420
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
If you go to burn a CD

421
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Or use to work this way

422
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Or not burn if you want to rip a CD

423
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Is it just rip?

424
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah, then you'd insert the CD

425
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Your program would go out to the CD database

426
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
See if there's already an entry for it

427
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Because they're all marked specifically

428
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
If there's not an entry for it

429
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Then you're asked to enter the tracks

430
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And information yourself

431
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And then I think it looks at

432
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Three or four different entries before

433
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It makes a final entry and it locks it down

434
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And that's it

435
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So we could do something like that

436
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Which would then reverse

437
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Engineer the ID three tags back into it

438
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I still think it comes down to the artists

439
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Having to do that if they're serious about their art

440
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And selling it or distributing it

441
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Then they're going to have to

442
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You know, they're going to have to do some extra work

443
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And it's not all that much work

444
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's just, you know, people don't realize

445
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And it's so awareness is the main thing that we can take care of

446
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But again, not a store, not into customer service

447
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And we already have plenty of customer service

448
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And we're dealing with

449
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
With the staff that we have available

450
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Jonathan Quirk

451
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Sent an interesting email

452
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Understand the radio station consoles

453
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Often have a cough button that mutes the microphone

454
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
For as long as it's pressed

455
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah, that's pretty traditional

456
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Given your frequent gastious emissions that you blame on the coffee

457
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Perhaps casplaster might could add a

458
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Senseo button to casplaster

459
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
This would spare our ears from what is becoming

460
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Tiresome with repetition

461
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Rather than dead air resulting from its use

462
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Maybe it would pause the recording momentarily

463
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Or it could mute the mic and insert the words

464
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And say when you're best speaking voice

465
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Well, saving us from another bell

466
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Well, a casplaster actually has that

467
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's called pause and it's called talk

468
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You couldn't click either button off if you want

469
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But I think you what you want is you want it on the listener side

470
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You want some kind of warning when it's coming up

471
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So that you don't have to listen to it

472
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
No, that is not one of the features planned on the

473
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
The final release candidate of casplaster

474
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Which is coming up

475
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
We're just about to release one point out

476
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We'll just about casplaster mic and I

477
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And I'm not talking about it

478
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's what do you up to beta 61 and beta 61 which isn't out yet

479
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Mike has done something incredible

480
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
He really went the extra mile and I appreciate it

481
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And I'm sure the droves of

482
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Other people are going to appreciate it

483
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Because he he started to work on the accessibility

484
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And we've talked about this many times before

485
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
But blind the blind community

486
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Has problems with lots of websites

487
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That there's screen readers can't follow

488
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
We have plenty of issues with that

489
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And you know and I have committed to working on that

490
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
As soon as we get some of the basic stuff out

491
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And rolling we're going to be doing some work in that area

492
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And proof of that is Mike who is made casplaster

493
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Accessible

494
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Now I believe that it's already accessible

495
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You know the all the play buttons and everything

496
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
We'll respond in the was it jaws or whatever other screen reader

497
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
A blind person can use

498
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But the problem has always been the levels, the meter

499
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
So I have a visual feedback here

500
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Which is basically like two LED meters

501
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That are yellow and then they go into green

502
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And then they go into red if you're over modulating

503
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And he sent me a little clip yesterday

504
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Which I don't know if he'd want me to play that

505
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
In fact most of it's in Dutch

506
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
But it's really cool you can set it up

507
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So that if you start to hit the peak limit the peak volume

508
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You get a little

509
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Audio feedback in your headphones

510
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Which will only be in your headphones

511
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So it isn't actually recorded on the show

512
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So then you know you have to pull back your volume

513
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
A little bit which is just fantastic

514
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And I think that we could have all kinds of audio cues

515
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Going on to be very, very cool

516
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So look forward to that

517
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I believe that's coming out in version 61

518
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Hey Adam it's Heather from Ruby Food Radio

519
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Where it's all girls all the time

520
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
And I've been listening to everybody

521
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Gush about Laura Clap over the course of the past couple of episodes of the DSC

522
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And I'm really glad she's finally getting some attention

523
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Because she's an amazing talent and she really deserves all the accolades that she's getting

524
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And women don't seem to be getting much attention in the podcasting world

525
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But hopefully that's going to change soon

526
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I for one I'm trying to do my part

527
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000

542
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000

Well I guess I can he's from the poop report

546
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Hey Adam with Chris Rockwell obviously suffering the world's worst case of constipation

547
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
That means he hasn't done a daily download in months

548
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I turn to you

549
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
poop for peace day is coming on April 14th

550
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Without Chris you are my conduit to the podcasting world

551
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And thus humanities greatest hope

552
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
The message of poop for peace day is simple

553
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Republican or Democrat

554
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I really need some some music for this

555
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Well I'll just give it a little echo

556
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The message of poop for peace day is simple

557
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Republican or Democrat black or white

558
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Man or woman Christian

559
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
We all suffer equally under the tyranny of the bowel

560
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
pooping is the only point of commonality

561
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
All human beings face and as such

562
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It can be the basis for world peace

563
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000

You know strange things have happened

567
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Some have changed the world by sitting in the back of the bus

568
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And some could change to

569
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Oh man

570
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And some can change the world just by sitting on the throne

571
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Comics trip

572
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Comics trip

573
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Comics trip

574
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Comics trip

575
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Oh man it just gets better

576
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I don't know if he's going to send in a comment every day he keeps threatening not to

577
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
But then he keeps sending in fantastic audio comments ladies and gentlemen

578
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
It is not mad wine scene

579
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
This is a real person a real

580
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I'd have to say fan of the show

581
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
There's no other reason why it'd be so

582
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Intricately involved

583
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Yesterday asked our friend comic strip blogger

584
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
What his talents are what he can do

585
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
You know what are his skills

586
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And maybe we can work with him in that regard

587
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
You know I always see the positive in people and

588
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Comics are bloggers been

589
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
He wants me to use the word candid

590
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
But I would say in some ways abusive

591
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Certainly of the English language

592
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
In the comments at curry.com

593
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Which regard the daily source code

594
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And I asked him to let me know

595
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
You know what he does he certainly seems to have a lot of time on his hands

596
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And here's his response

597
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I don't carry my skills

598
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I don't want that to know

599
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Frisky you are

600
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Well no point in elaborating on that I see

601
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Because I am not your whole

602
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I repeat

603
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I am not your whole

604
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So unless you seriously

605
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Want to hire me at Potshore Inc

606
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Stop being so curious for a fact's sake

607
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Generally

608
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I have impression that you are one of those gazes

609
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Who like to play

610
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Unsuriously with people

611
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Like cats play with mice

612
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Show me wrong

613
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And agree on granting me in person

614
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And interview mainly about mobile phones

615
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And then I will tell you my skillset

616
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
The other shit

617
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Why?

618
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I should give you information

619
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
If you don't want to give me an interview

620
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Cut the crap alright

621
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
You have your head stuck up your ass

622
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Adam curry

623
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So let's change topic

624
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
For me to poop on

625
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Take a cue there

626
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
From...

627
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Was it the insult comic dog?

628
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
No no no comic street blogger

629
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm sorry

630
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It works the other way around

631
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
You want the interview

632
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You got to do something for me first

633
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
So tell us a little bit about you

634
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And you know

635
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You can send in your questions

636
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I'll answer them

637
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I love mobile phones

638
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
That's all I have to say about the topic

639
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
But we still love to know more about what you're about

640
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And what makes you taken

641
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
What you can do

642
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And how we could put you to good use

643
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Comic street blogger

644
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
That's really what we want

645
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Hi there

646
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I'm Doug Rhapson

647
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The host of geek acres

648
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
It's a weekly podcast

649
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
About

650
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Well

651
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Geek stuff

652
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
The internet science fiction

653
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And other good stuff

654
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Hmm

655
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
That's not a particularly good description

656
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Maybe I could get someone to help explain it

657
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Oh

658
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
There's my friend Kelly

659
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Hey

660
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Kelly Lewis

661
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
How would you explain my podcast

662
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Geek acres

663
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It's about three generations of women

664
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And their lives

665
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And it's very very witty

666
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And the characters talk very very fast

667
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Um

668
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Okay

669
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Yeah

670
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Thanks

671
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Maybe we need to dive into this

672
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Um

673
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Oh

674
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
There's Steve Ealy

675
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
He knows about podcasts

676
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Steve

677
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Steve

678
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
How would you say that Geek acres has changed the potosphere

679
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I believe that we live in an era

680
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Where anything that can be expressed as bits will be

681
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I believe that bits exist to be copied

682
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
That's

683
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Deep

684
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Are you getting a sense of the show yet?

685
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It's video games

686
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
A generation of women

687
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And some bits

688
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Anything we've missed even

689
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Speaks on a mobile

690
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Play

691
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Yeah

692
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
That too

693
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000

694
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000

Three, four, two

704
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
About people ripping off your flicker images

705
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Oh man

706
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
That was such a real bummer

707
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
What he did extremely bad

708
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Good luck with the core case

709
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And I hope it's got news

710
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000

712

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And if you're coming

718
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Bring me something for this

719
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Yeah

720
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Influencing children all over the world

721
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Very proud of the job I'm doing

722
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
That's podcasting.au

723
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
By the way

724
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
A bunch of kids who are doing some podcasting

725
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It's great

726
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Check them out podcasting.au

727
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Let's get back into that

728
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Multi-teared internet thing

729
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Because a lot of confusion about

730
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
The two issues at hand

731
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
One is email

732
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
ISPs

733
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Where you get an email address

734
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Filtering out all kinds of email

735
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Which actually you want to receive

736
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And basically

737
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Charging for email

738
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
That you may not want to receive

739
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And then of course

740
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
There's the AT&T

741
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Controversy

742
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I love seeing that word

743
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
The AT&T Controversy

744
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
They're saying that they want to charge

745
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Services like Google

746
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Like Yahoo

747
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I'm sure eventually

748
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Potcho too

749
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And if you start a business

750
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
They'll charge you too

751
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Just like they're

752
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You know they're

753
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Calling our email spam now

754
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
The same will happen

755
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And people I just get tons of email

756
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
The people are saying

757
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Oh, now I finally get it

758
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You know I wasn't getting

759
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Registration emails through

760
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So here's where it gets a bit

761
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Confusing

762
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Myo Yard Enough

763
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So to add them

764
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Listening to Charlie 248

765
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I think 348

766
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Not so easy to get around

767
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Large ISPs like AT&T

768
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Bill South or even AOL

769
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
See you may reject them as your ISPs

770
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So that you vote with your money

771
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Which is what I said yesterday

772
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
As you know if you have if you're

773
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
With an ISP that is charging money

774
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
To receive email

775
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Then you may want to consider

776
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Taking your money elsewhere

777
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
However that's not so easy

778
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You see AT&T and others own large

779
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Backbones that are throughout the whole

780
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Continent and that smaller

781
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Broadband ISPs rely on

782
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
You may be choosing your own smaller

783
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Small ISPs but because they rely on

784
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Large ISPs to serve their customers

785
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Voting with your money becomes irrelevant

786
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
As AT&T will be taxing your small ISPs

787
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Instead of you, AT&T doesn't care who they tax

788
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And the small ISPs will increase their prices

789
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
To cope with so that you get hit

790
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Anyway

791
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Just some food for thought

792
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Agree something has to be done about it

793
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Tearing the network is ridiculous

794
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Enjoy Myo

795
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Okay, so a couple things here

796
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
First of all, service is like Google

797
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And also the Pod Show PDM

798
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Doesn't work

799
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
It's not like we got out

800
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
We went out and bought three gigabits worth of bandwidth

801
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
That is the model that I believe will not scale

802
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
For the type of media that we're looking at

803
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
In fact, I've been sitting here watching

804
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
A show download from Potomatic.com

805
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I have no idea if it's their bandwidth

806
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Or what it is but it's just been grinding away

807
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
For an hour trying to download one podcast

808
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
They're whole site of slow

809
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
This is because

810
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
This is huge data

811
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
This is just unbelievable

812
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
If you take all these podcasts, the size of the files

813
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And the number of people that are downloading

814
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Companies like Google and Pot Show as well

815
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
We have either directly or indirectly

816
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
If peering agreements

817
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So we sit actually at a different place

818
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Where we connect to backbones like AT&T

819
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And there's no money changing hands and no taxation

820
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It's really okay, you're going to give me this bandwidth

821
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm going to pass off this much to you

822
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It's kind of equal so we call it a peering agreement

823
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Because we're peers

824
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
So no money actually changes hands at that point

825
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
This is down at the consumer end

826
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Which is a lot more interesting

827
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Because you have basically paid for your eight megabits per second

828
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And they're going to tax that

829
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
A little bit further up the pipeline

830
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
You know as to what comes in

831
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
So it could indeed affect your ISP

832
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But I think most ISPs

833
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Have similar type of arrangements

834
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Peering agreements the larger ones

835
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Not everyone has to participate in this multi-tiered system

836
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
As it pertains to email

837
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I don't think that

838
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Any backbone provider will filter the email

839
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
This is the ISPs services themselves

840
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Who are of course performing a great service

841
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
By filtering out all the spam that you don't want

842
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
But I believe we're performing a true disservice

843
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
If they charge companies for sending email for guaranteed delivery

844
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
That was not the intent of email

845
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Not the way it was supposed to be set up

846
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And it's just a bad idea

847
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Hi Adam, it's Barry Reiketer at thickandblock.com

848
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Catching a couple of DSC's lately

849
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Sorry the Charlie

850
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Notice one of my co-workers Matt Snaggress

851
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Posted audio feedback

852
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Well it turns out

853
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I RIT department should be writing you a check

854
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Because I only found out that I was missing out on some pod show emails

855
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Because they were getting trapped in our spam filter

856
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
So went back and looked and sure enough there was some emails from you

857
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Which brings us to another subject

858
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I know this has been a big subject on the Charlie for the last couple episodes

859
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I managed to catch an episode of this week in tech

860
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And they were talking about it too

861
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
But the idea about this couple of things on spam

862
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And certified emails and AOL charging

863
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
This whole issue can be really resolved with something that you

864
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You mentioned a few episodes ago

865
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Which is you know RSS

866
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I mean it's a solution

867
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Why you know I know you mentioned

868
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Not wanting to talk about technology on the show

869
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
But it's just so brain dead easy to have an RSS reader

870
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And subscribe to feeds of things

871
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Instead of jamming up people's email boxes

872
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It'll be guaranteed you'll get more data probably

873
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
That people are looking at it

874
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Because you can go back to web server logs

875
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Or a advertiser or a content publisher

876
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Corporations should use it internally

877
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
You could have the HR channel

878
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
You could have the facilities, the parking lot channel

879
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
You could even have that there's leftover pizza in the kitchen channel

880
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
So I mean RSS seems like the solution

881
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I wonder why more corporations and publishers and marketers aren't adopting it

882
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Because that seems to be the way to go

883
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Anyway Adam, that's my rant

884
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Thanks for listening and keep up the great work

885
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Love the new long format shows

886
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Hope you keep those up too

887
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Thanks a lot

888
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I really appreciate the feedback that these two guys are giving me

889
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Because they're actually in a way

890
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
They're customers of pod show

891
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
But they're very, very on the ball

892
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
These guys from the advertising and marketing community

893
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And they are really all over this stuff

894
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And so first of all I appreciate that

895
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Second of all you have course RSS is going to be great

896
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
You know, I think we still need better aggregators, better news readers

897
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Anxiously awaiting the arrival of Windows Vista

898
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Which will have an RSS engine built inside

899
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
That all kinds of new applications will be able to be built on

900
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And of course that's where we can start to integrate

901
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
RSS delivery

902
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
That you can integrate right into

903
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I guess right into an email client if you will

904
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
It could look like email except you could actually have a little button

905
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I don't receive email from this person anymore

906
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Actually, I just had an interesting idea

907
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So what if we had some kind of interim gateway

908
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Let's just say it's on your computer right?

909
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And email comes in

910
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And let's just say it's completely

911
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Oh man that's going to be so tough

912
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Hmm

913
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Maybe you can set up a channel so that if I sent you an email

914
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It would be from Atomacrui.com

915
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And that would you say okay turn this into a channel

916
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Which means guaranteed delivery to you

917
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And it would show up just like regular email

918
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And of course on the other side

919
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I mean this is all under the hood stuff

920
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
So no one would ever have to see this

921
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I think the only additional thing is

922
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
A button in your email client that says

923
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And forget how we do it under the hood RSS

924
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I think is probably perfect

925
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But let's just forget that

926
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Let's just say you had one extra piece of functionality

927
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
That showed up in all email clients

928
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And that was

929
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
No longer receive email from

930
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Let's not call it spam

931
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Let's just say no longer receive email from

932
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
This person or this entity

933
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Or definitely you know always receive email from this person or entity

934
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Maybe maybe that would work

935
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
But the real problem comes down to the registration emails

936
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
When you're making that first initial contact

937
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
So I have Joan Kelly who writes in

938
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Hey Adam I'm a lady listener from Australia

939
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Ah

940
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It's the Sheila

941
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
We call you Sheila's down under

942
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Firstly thanks so much for the Charlie

943
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
The Charlie

944
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I love your show

945
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
You are such a pal from me to listen to

946
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
During my driving time or other times when my ears are free

947
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
You are an inspiration with lots of creative energy

948
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Good great communication

949
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Believe you said a good example

950
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Okay, that's all I thank you very much

951
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
A refreshing change from the pathetic siege

952
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Mentality of big business and it's death throws

953
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
This crazy stuff of emails not getting through

954
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
When people try to reach their customers

955
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Is legitimate transactions

956
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Just makes me so cross

957
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I did experience that problem when registering

958
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
On the positive music network to make a test purchase

959
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Finally I realized lots of mail went a stray from various podcasts

960
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Or when I tried to register or obtain logins or something

961
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Including even the Don and Drew Show and many many others

962
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
They probably thought their listeners were either

963
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Giving bogus email addresses or letting their replies

964
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Or letting their replies get lost in a junk mail folders

965
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
See this is not just pod show

966
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
It's all kinds of emails and registration

967
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Things that are going back and forth

968
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
These really big these really

969
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
But really these idiot big email companies

970
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Are vandalizing the email process

971
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
It was well known that hotmail block Gmail invitations

972
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I didn't actually know that how lame is that

973
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Oh

974
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
But I presume they were just

975
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Singling them out to hurt email competition

976
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I think that's really wrong by the way

977
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I have used my noxious little hotmail account for situations

978
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Where I may be allowing my address to get into the wild

979
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
But now I realize that all

980
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
A hotmail account is good for is for collecting spam

981
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
The legitimate mail often can't even get through the junk folder

982
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Spam starts before you even open your hotmail account

983
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Of course since every possible address seems to be already on

984
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
The spam or list

985
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Getting to the point at last

986
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I realize I must be kinder to genuine organizations

987
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Or sites that I communicate with

988
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Especially if an automated reply or applying bulk may be involved

989
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
And give them the address from my own mail server

990
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
So they can reach me without some poor guy having to manually

991
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Resend a password to log in thinking to me

992
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Interesting that's such individual manually operated

993
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Generated messages from PMN do arrive but not the automated ones

994
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Okay, so first of all

995
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Yeah, that's true

996
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Both Chris Rockwell and Chris McIntyre

997
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Rockwell for pod sake music network and McIntyre for pod cast

998
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Ali actually do I think combine the probably about 100 emails a day

999
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
They were approving manually and sending out

1000
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I guess from different email accounts or something that does work and does get through

1001
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And that's a huge burden

1002
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I mean may seem pretty easy but it's not

1003
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You know this stuff is supposed to be automatic

1004
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It's supposed to get there automatic

1005
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
So but I just had another idea about this because of course

1006
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
The ultimate solution is to run your own email service

1007
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Now this is where it gets kind of kind of funky

1008
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
But wouldn't it be great

1009
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
God do you remember the cube

1010
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Which I who made the cube

1011
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It was bought by Sun Microsystems at one point but the cube was a beautiful box

1012
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:59,000
It was this actually very aesthetically pleasing in a kind of 80s kind of way to look at server

1013
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And you literally just you could hook it up to your cable mode or your ADSL

1014
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And it had everything built in

1015
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
It had your own little internet, a place free to store files

1016
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
You could mount folders and just it was basically a server

1017
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
But it also had an email server built in

1018
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And a couple other

1019
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
You know a couple other really nice features

1020
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
And I don't know if they discontinued

1021
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Work on that or not but of course these days it would be a box that would have Wi-Fi built in

1022
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Let's say we could really

1023
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
We could really get that down to something quite cost effective

1024
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And it probably shouldn't even have Wi-Fi

1025
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Just stick it into your cable mode

1026
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
And it'll basically just appear

1027
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I think we have enough open source

1028
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
And it ran on Linux of course

1029
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I think we have enough open source technology to make that a pretty seamless operation

1030
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
So what if we just instead of calling it an email service or just called it

1031
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
You know the ultimate

1032
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Well we'll have to work on the messaging and the marketing

1033
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
But the whole point is you would have control over what is spam and what is not spam

1034
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
And even if something got caught in spam you could still go back

1035
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Into your own

1036
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Server and you could fix that now

1037
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Doesn't sound like something that consumers would want to get into

1038
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
What if it was just seamless what if

1039
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
By the way Gmail a Google thought for you guys Jesus

1040
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I would buy this in a heartbeat

1041
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
So I could have unlimited storage all my stuff would be secure where I wanted

1042
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It would be accessible all over the internet

1043
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Presumably of course because if your home connection goes down

1044
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
But that's gotten so much better over the years

1045
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I think that'll probably survive

1046
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And you could have all the functionality you wanted

1047
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
You could have webmail

1048
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
It could be completely secure

1049
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
You couldn't let anything through that you want

1050
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
You could of course could have set up your own RSS versions of email

1051
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
That may be a way to go that would be a really nice consumer device

1052
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Just a small thing plugs in call the ultimate email manager or spam

1053
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Whatever you want to call it just so that people understand what it does

1054
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
And we could solve a lot of those problems just a thought just a thought

1055
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Let's see a couple more things before I go today

1056
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And I have another pod state music song especially for the Wednesday

1057
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I had him this is CQ I just thought I could give you some quick audio feedback on Charles 346

1058
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Charles

1059
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Roger Smalls left you a note about going to the park and not being able to chase

1060
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Follow women or pick flowers because it's a public park

1061
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
You know as you well know there are many

1062
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Public schools in the UK

1063
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Those are privately educating children

1064
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
And therefore that is parents are paying for that education

1065
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
So it's another use of the word public meaning private in fact

1066
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
And therefore having to be paid for independently

1067
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Just thought I was an interesting thing

1068
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,000
The other thing you might want to check out is my website which is www.goct.com

1069
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
For slash I hate Adam Curry

1070
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Don't have a chance

1071
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I wasted my time going to that URL

1072
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Now you know what that's interesting you should have told me this before the before I went to court

1073
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Because it is true in the UK a public school is what we in the US would call a private school

1074
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Once again

1075
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Someone sent me in the correction this one nation divided by a common language

1076
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
You say tomato I say tomato tomorrow

1077
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Tomorrow by the way is the judgment

1078
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I'm nervous I gotta tell you I'm really nervous about what's going to come out of all this stuff

1079
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I really well

1080
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I'm quite sure the judge is going to rule in favor of violating the creative comments copyright

1081
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Again it all boils down to what kind of message is the judge going to send

1082
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
You know the Netherlands seems to be very interesting country these days

1083
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
There seems to be quite a lack of regard for individual copyright and intellectual property

1084
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Looking at their ASCAP VMI over there the Buma Stemera

1085
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And the Taiscopi Reicht and all these guys who are just hoarding money

1086
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Investing it

1087
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Investing other people's money losing that money

1088
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And then just polishing that away on the final year end results balance sheet

1089
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Not good so I think a message has to be sent about the value of intellectual property

1090
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Because it does work both ways if I steal a 99 cent song

1091
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I can get a hundred and fifty thousand dollars lawsuit slapped against me

1092
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
If I what if I just post it some pictures from playboy magazine

1093
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Yeah, I've been through all that crap before so tomorrow we'll hear about it

1094
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Some other great news

1095
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I've got a fantastic lead on a safety pilot Captain Dan

1096
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Who actually flies out of echo golf tango fox trot fair oaks airfield

1097
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Which is where Delta Shiro will be parked starting the end of this month

1098
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And so we've had some email back and forth and really really hoping that that we can get that together

1099
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Be so cool to have a local person doing that

1100
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,000
But still if you have any any ideas about someone who could fly as safety pilot with me

1101
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
You know most then weekend sometimes in overnight

1102
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It's a paid gig of course and the more experience the better obviously

1103
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I just you know yes, I talked briefly about the Academy Awards

1104
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I was so proud I forgot to tell you this the movie Capote

1105
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Was directed by a guy named Bennett Miller and I know Bennett not very well

1106
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I know his brother extremely well JB Miller

1107
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Who used to work at MTV in the town department in fact he was the guy that the first person I saw in Patricia

1108
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,000
And I walked off the airplane at JFK when we came to the states and I came to work for MTV and we started our new life

1109
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
He was there to pick us up JB Miller just an incredibly smart guy

1110
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:38,000
He now has a company called Empire Entertainment and he produces huge shows for corporations with major major stars

1111
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
And I remember it was a couple years ago

1112
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And that I was at JB's apartment and his brother was actually I don't know if he was living there at the time

1113
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,000
But he had an avid editing suite set up in the apartment and he was running around

1114
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And then it's very very creative they're both these guys both you know

1115
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,000
They're on the edge of brilliant and loony and it was it was so incredibly intense

1116
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
And he was doing a movie at the time called

1117
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Was it not rush

1118
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Oh stupid of me it was about a tour on one of those London double deckers and downtown Manhattan

1119
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And they were editing it and you know Drew Barrymore was in and out of the apartment

1120
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
It was just an incredibly weird scene

1121
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
But you know a very creative and artistic scene

1122
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I just wanted to say I'm so incredibly proud of the work that Bennett has done

1123
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
And how far he's come in such a short amount of time and I haven't seen the movie yet

1124
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
But I do intend on seeing it it looks absolutely fantastic

1125
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And so props to him I mean out of the gate

1126
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
So it's his second feature the first one that was a real full blown

1127
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Why the distributed feature to be nominated for best director is is just fantastic

1128
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I still don't have to see all that shit on television because I really don't care anymore about the award ceremonies

1129
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
But I got to say men props to you for sure

1130
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
So more props going out to the palm cast member pum pum pum

1131
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
The French podcaster who quit his day job to podcast full time

1132
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Well congratulations to him and his wife

1133
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
There baby girl arrived her name is night night eely

1134
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
There you go night eely

1135
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
And so we have another podcast listener on the scene

1136
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Now only what is it?

1137
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
99,999,999 to go and then we're at 100 million mark

1138
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
All right, winding it up for today

1139
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
This is a song that I've actually played before on a Wednesdays

1140
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Kind of fitting for your Wednesday morning vibe as we roll the Charlie outs for another episode

1141
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Free judgment day

1142
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I stepped out of my doorstep

1143
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
We in stem on in look real fun

1144
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Took a glance at my wrist wall

1145
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Getting in my rhythm time

1146
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Let my little girl sitting pretty in the bed

1147
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
It's just my arms I touched the sky

1148
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Time to clear my weary fear

1149
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
In stem on in

1150
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Take my blues away

1151
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
It means they're morning

1152
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
It's gonna be a part of day

1153
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It means they're morning

1154
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
It's come so many times before

1155
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I used to cry when I put my life

1156
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
But I'm not going too many times

1157
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
With a miss Johnson

1158
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
It's our school boys skipping by

1159
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Took a dome to my head

1160
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
What a thing

1161
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
What a high

1162
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Let my hands kick to my feet

1163
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Dance around the y'all so sweet

1164
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
A listen to the bird is seen

1165
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
The music was a treat

1166
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
When it's dead body

1167
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Take my blues away

1168
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
When it's dead body

1169
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
It's gonna be a part of day

1170
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
It's gonna be a part of day

1171
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
It's come so many times before

1172
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I used to cry when I put my life

1173
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
But I'm not going too many times before

1174
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I'm not going too many times

1175
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I used to cry when I put my life

1176
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I used to cry when I put my life

1177
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I used to cry when I put my life

1178
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I used to cry when I put my life

1179
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I used to cry when I put my life

1180
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I used to cry when I put my life

1181
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I used to cry when I put my life

1182
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I used to cry when I put my life

1183
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I used to cry when I put my life

1184
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I used to cry when I put my life

1185
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I used to cry when I put my life

1186
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I used to cry when I put my life

1187
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I used to cry when I put my life

1188
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I used to cry when I put my life

1189
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000

00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I used to cry when I put my life

1194
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000

00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I used to cry when I put my life

1206
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Just call so many times before,

1207
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
And use the crowd of all my life,

1208
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
But I might go to,

1209
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
And I'm going to evolve,

1210
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Now I evolve,

1211
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000

So I evolve,

1240
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Now I evolve,

1241
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Now my life,

1242
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
So I evolve,

1243
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Now I evolve,

00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Now I evolve,

1245
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000

Now I evolve,

1248
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Now I evolve,

1249
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Now I evolve,

1250
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Now I evolve,

1251
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Now I evolve,

1252
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Now I evolve,

1253
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Now I evolve,

1254
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,280
So hopefully tomorrow I'll have some information for you about the judgment of the theft

1255
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:18,560
of my pictures for publication in a commercial magazine, as well as the endangerment of my

1256
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,560
child.

1257
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:24,040
You'd hope that at least we'd get something somehow, don't you know what I mean?

1258
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:28,120

00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,280
Remember I'll have a Victor Mike Charlie a video cast, a video music cast coming up

1261
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:42,760

1262
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:47,240
oh, there's a message from PW Fenton saying, where's the damn show?

1263
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:56,480
If I cast Lester, cast Lester, see you guys tomorrow, another pod show podcast, stick it

1264

in your ear.
