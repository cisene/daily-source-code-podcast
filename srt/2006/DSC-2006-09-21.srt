6

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This just in on news from the border.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The Pope officially apologized today to Adam Curry and his daily source code for making remarks

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
which Adam Curry found offensive.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The Pope was officially quoted as saying,

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Adam, who?

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We now return your to Adam Curry's daily source code which here at the border.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He's known as Doritos Salsa Chalupa.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Number four, six, single.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hey, you figured out.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Sixty million dollars worth of airplane strapped my ass.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Adam Curry.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Well, my baby don't wear no panties.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Ask me how I know.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
How do you know?

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
How do you know?

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I said my baby don't wear no panties.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Ask me how I know.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
How do you know?

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
How do you know?

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Since it likes that natural feeling.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
She knows it turns me on.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But I do good for right.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
In my drop top can't lag.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
She would want food in the front seat.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
She would want food in the back.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
By banning food we're shouting.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
In she even getting us queer,

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
keep your eyes on the road,

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and your hands are real.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's my baby don't wear no panties.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Ask me how I know.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How do you know?

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Tell me the truth.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I came home late from work

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Tired and flung you down

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Baby, won't answer a party

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
She was dancing all about

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Just stood up on the bed

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's got to be when the bump and grind

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
She raised up a dress you know

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It was every time

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Cause my baby don't wear no panties

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It has been how I know

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I need no

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I need no

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This is like a natural feeling

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
She knows it tells me how

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I need no

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I need no

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I need no

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I need no

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I need no

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I need no

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I need no

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I need no

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I need no

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I need no

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Come

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Come

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Come

72
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,620
Come

73
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,620
Come

74
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,640
Come

75
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:16,640
Come

76
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:22,640
So dancing on the tables, I keep putting on the show

77
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,640
The crowd was going crazy, now everybody knows

78
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,640
My baby don't, we're no fanning

79
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,640
Yes, man, how I know

80
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,640
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

81
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,640
There's a like that natural feeling

82
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,640
And she knows the terms, me, oh

83
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Took her right in the morning

84
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,640
She wore a leather-minister skirt

85
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,640
Dug a nails in to my shoulders

86
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,640
When we laid down to the curves

87
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,640
I went through all the gears

88
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,640
Max out to our feet

89
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,640
She was screaming fast to faster

90
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,640
With both legs and a wind

91
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,640
I'm not feeling well, we're no fanning

92
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,640
As we have our own eyes

93
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,640
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

94
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,640

Let's wait, hey, go.

130
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,880
Yeah, me and Jean, count them to die hard.

131
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,600
So mama, though, that is coming home.

132
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Our baby don't wear.

133
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,440
No panties.

134
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,240
From the Podsate Music Network, suggested by Daddy Dows.

135
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,080
Thank you very much.

136
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,400
I could have waited for it for the Fubar festivities tomorrow,

137
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,240
but I like it.

138
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,000
Hey, going through today's show prep,

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,160
which usually takes me about an hour and a half.

140
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,080
And I'm late today because we spent time looking at yet another house.

141
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,840
Yes, we've got to keep all of our options open.

142
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,320
Things are looking very good here in the affluent suburb of Surrey,

143
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,960
known as Gilford in the United Kingdom,

144
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,440
in the current Curry Cottage.

145
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,120
I was like, yeah, this is going to be a great show.

146
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,760
And people were sending in really relevant stuff.

147
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,880
There's great feedback.

148
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,080
I've got some cool tunes for you, some emotions, some,

149
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,400
well, just everything you'd want on a Thursday.

150
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,320
And the big news, this is actually with Patricia

151
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,440
woke me up with this morning.

152
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,880
She brought me my cup of tea, which is just before I have to get out of bed

153
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,880
and go take Christina to school.

154
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,560
And she had the news for me.

155
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,720
It was quite, it was one of those things that you go,

156
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,160
oh, shit, man, that sucks, that's shocking.

157
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
And then the other hand, you think yourself, wow,

158
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,840
how crappy it was, you play dangerous things can happen.

159
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,800
It was almost like a Steve Irwin moment, if you were.

160
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,840
Hello, Adam.

161
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,240
Well, you always talking about how much you,

162
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,480
I was like, talk to it, which is I'm as being an accident.

163
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,400
Just know the news report now, at a family service,

164
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,520
for some time, I'll be on Wednesday.

165
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,840
We're going to have 350 mile collision, not collision,

166
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,960
350 mile accidents with a jet power car,

167
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,440
somewhere in New York and then you've been flown to,

168
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,800
I think, lead neurological centre or something

169
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,880
in the air anyway, apparently in a critical,

170
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,880
but stable can.

171
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,880
I don't know, I wonder what, if it will change,

172
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,880
could I be, I wonder if they'll show it?

173
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,120
I don't know, oh, yeah, hopefully you're still getting

174
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,120
and I hope that you watch those films along very nice.

175
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,360
I can't wait to get it.

176
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,160
Anyway, Adam, again, recently, Kate, thanks, bye.

177
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,600
Yeah, well, no, no, thank you very much.

178
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,760
So that is exactly the news, Richard Hammond.

179
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,120
Now, this is not the god that I spoke about the other time we talked

180
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,840
about this car show that the BBC does,

181
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,440
which is received an Emmy from the American Academy of Television

182
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,800
Peeps.

183
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,040
This is Richard Hammond, who's the sidekick,

184
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,400
one of the two sidekicks.

185
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,720
He's a really adorable guy.

186
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,640
He's, let's say, vertically challenged in the opposite direction

187
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,920
that I am.

188
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,080
And they always do fun stuff on the show.

189
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,720
I told you, they raised amazingly fast cars,

190
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
they were kinds of wacky stuff.

191
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,760
And I'm reading from the BBC report here.

192
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,120
Mr. Hammond had been in a dragster style car capable

193
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,280
of reaching speeds of about 300 miles an hour

194
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,800
at Ovington Airfield, New York.

195
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,040
That's that I believe that we're the new top gear studios

196
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,440
used to be near to the cottage and dunce fold.

197
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,560
I'm going to read here from, let me see, one of the eyewitnesses.

198
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,120
Here we go.

199
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,320
Former firefighter Dave Ogdon, who runs private firm

200
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,640
event fire services, one of the first people at the scene.

201
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
He said, we were down there with top gear

202
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,000
who were filming him trying to break the British land speed record.

203
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,160
Well, you'd need 300 miles an hour for that.

204
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,800
On the previous run, the car had just gone over 300 miles an hour

205
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,040
but I'm not sure if it had broken the record.

206
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,880
They just won more run and they were planning to finish

207
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,080
when it veered off to the right.

208
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,000
So it's a little unclear if that was while decelerating

209
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,360
from 300 miles an hour or if it was on an actual run.

210
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,400
But one of the parachutes deployed but it went on over to the grass

211
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,600
and spun over before coming to arrest about 100 yards from us.

212
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,640
I guess he's talking about the car, not the parachute.

213
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,440
And apparently, so the car flipped upside down

214
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,320
and Richard's head was digging into the grass.

215
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,680
The final quote here, Mr. Ogdon said he felt for pulse

216
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,480
and heard Mr. Hammond breathing before the emergency cruise

217
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,760
worked together to turn the car right way up and then cut him free.

218
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,400
He added, he was regaining consciousness at that point

219
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,520
and he said he had some lower back pain, you know, shit.

220
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,520
But it was drifting it out of consciousness a little bit.

221
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,120
So it's very unclear as to how severe his injuries are.

222
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,520
And but it doesn't look good.

223
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,760
I have to be honest, it does not sound good.

224
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,160
He could be particularly lower back pain.

225
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,760
You know, we don't know if he could feel his legs or any of that.

226
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,120
I mean, this is just horrible.

227
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,960
But then again, it's one of those Steve Irwin moments.

228
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,600
You know, it's like, well, shit dude, you know, you go 300 miles an hour

229
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,440
and then you know, shit can go wrong.

230
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,000
Sometimes, you know, you get caught up and doing stuff for television.

231
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,280
And if I think back to the number of times that I've done celebrity races

232
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,080
in all kinds of vehicles, everything's subsci-diving.

233
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,200
That's where I always drew the line.

234
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
I've done, I've really done a lot of it.

235
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,880
And some pretty dangerous stuff when you think about it.

236
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,720
Not just physically demanding, but to being in dangerous places and dangerous situations.

237
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
And you do that because it's like, hey, I'm from TV.

238
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,040
I'm fucking invincible, right?

239
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,800
No, there you go.

240
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,160
Turns out it ain't that way.

241
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,840
And remember, the lesson here, it's not speed that kills.

242
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,160
It's the lack of speed.

243
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,200
It's Thursday, it's done for my ass to get back in shape.

244
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,920
Adam, it's Amy Mack, how are you?

245
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,280
Hey, baby, I'm good, how are you doing?

246
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,320
All right, if you don't feel today's but exercise,

247
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,520
I don't know what I'll do.

248
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,680
We hire or change careers or something.

249
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,120
No, no, no, no, no, we'll work on it today.

250
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,840
Get the ass work.

251
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,840
Today and this move is the least complex of everything we've done this far.

252
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,040
Okay, let me get the other mic.

253
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,840
Are you ready?

254
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,800
Yeah, I'm ready.

255
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,160
Let's hear a little more enthusiasm.

256
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,800
Yeah, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.

257
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,360
All right, stand facing forward.

258
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,000
Face and forward.

259
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,360
Be shoulder with the part.

260
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,160
Yep.

261
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,600
Toes facing forward.

262
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,560
Yep.

263
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,960
Now take your right leg and lift it to the back wall.

264
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,400
Your foot should only be a few inches off the ground.

265
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,520
Oh, okay, yeah, go on it.

266
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,400
Hands on hips.

267
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,600
Just move that mic like this.

268
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,400
We need the butt.

269
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,440
Oh, yes.

270
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,400
Squeeze it tighter.

271
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,280
Oh, yes.

272
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,320
And balance.

273
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,440
Yeah, I'm balance, ooh.

274
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,680
Make sure that the left knee is not locked out.

275
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,800
I'm squeezing the butt.

276
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,600
Are you squeezing?

277
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,480
Squeeze in the butt.

278
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,840
Squeeze tighter.

279
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,240
What could we feel it?

280
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,280
Yes.

281
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,280
Yes, make it do more seconds.

282
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,760
Oh, it feels like you have it now.

283
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,800
Yes.

284
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,760
Yes, yeah, yeah.

285
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,680
Bring that leg down and take the left up.

286
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,120
All right, here we go, left arm.

287
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,720
Make sure not to turn your leg.

288
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,160
Your toes should be facing the ground.

289
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,280
Yep, toes facing the ground.

290
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,760
The left knee should still be in line with the hip and toes.

291
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,120
Yes, yes it is.

292
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,720
And I'm squeezing the knees.

293
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,400
Not locked, squeezing.

294
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
Balance, squeezing.

295
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,840
Squeeze.

296
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,600
Highters.

297
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,440
We say that again, baby.

298
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,640
Good and bring it down.

299
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
Okay, I think that does it for today.

300
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,480
Maybe I should start giving you homework to do in between our segments.

301
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,280
Okay, what do you think?

302
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,520
Sure.

303
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,280
As always, you can find me at fitness.patcho.com.

304
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,240
Yeah, that'll be the homework, right?

305
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,120
Take care, Adam.

306
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,480
Until next time.

307
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,760
Thanks for staying.

308
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,600
Amy Mack, I love you.

309
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,440
I love you.

310
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,280
Particularly when you tell me to squeeze a tighter.

311
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,080
Something, all of a sudden,

312
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,240
I had like an erotic moment there with Amy.

313
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,880
Oh yes, and you know what?

314
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,960
I asked us feel much better.

315
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,680
Thank you, Amy.

316
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,720
Thank you, Amy Mack.

317
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,760
Adam, this is a bug producer of the industry justice show.

318
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,960
Hey, you should go back to the old single, man.

319
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,640
This is, this is true, straight up.

320
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,360
I'm walking the work and you play those new jingles,

321
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
which I love for your phone numbers.

322
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,440
The dude, if I got your show right now,

323
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,400
I just remembered.

324
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:27,600
This one, two, one, six, two, five, six, three,

325
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,120
these five, seven.

326
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,840
It's stuck in my brain, man.

327
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,240
Go back to the old single.

328
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,200
Okay, later.

329
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,840
Hi, man.

330
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,240
Thank you.

331
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,440
You were probably talking about this one, Amy.

332
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,480
To reach Adam in America, dial.

333
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,800
Plus 1, 20, a 1, 6, 2, 5, 6, 3, 5, seven,

334
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,440
Plus 1, 20, a 1, 6, 2, 5, 6, 3, 5, 7,

335
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,400
Okay.

336
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:59,680
For Adam in Great Britain, dial plus 4, 4, 2, 0, 7,

337
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,040
6, 8, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3,

338
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:10,720
Plus 4, 4, 2, 0, 7, 6, 8, 1, 3, 7, 3,

339
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,240
Thanks for going on the daily soles code,

340
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,440
Goodbye. Oh. Hold it. It's concha.

341
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,640
Eeeeh.

342
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,600
Let me see. Where's that other one you were talking about?

343
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,320
And we see. Was this the one we check?

344
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,320
No, that's not it. Yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about. The, um,

345
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,200
what is it voice? I'm now just literally searching through my, uh,

346
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,360
it wasn't the voice momentally. It was, it was like something extreme.

347
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,600
Uh, X. I wish. I just wish I knew.

348
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,720
That crap. All right. Hey, that could be a real estate agent. I'll, I'll look for the other one.

349
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,560
I totally understand what you mean by that being, uh, being better. But anyway, it is

350
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:07,920
plus one two oh one six two five six three five seven or plus four four two zero seven six eight one three seven five three.

351
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,560
Uh, this was a nice piece of feedback. I got from, uh, Chris daily, the C dog.

352
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,080
Hey, Adam. This is Chris daily with the PMC top 10. And I have to thank you. I have to

353
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:24,800
publicly thank you for, you know, laying it out there and talking about your father. That really

354
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:31,760
to me was why I started listening to podcasts in the first place because it was real because it was

355
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,320
raw and hey, Kudos to you, man. It's one of the things I struggle with on the other show writing

356
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,680
with the window down. I tried to put it out there, but sometimes as you know, it's a little difficult.

357
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,800
Also, one of the reasons one of my favorite shows is Mikey pod on the buy you, uh,

358
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:55,200
Michael Herend doesn't amazing job and all his shows are like that. It's like rip it open and lay it out

359
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:01,040
there. Good stuff. I highly recommend it. And thanks again, Adam, you're doing a great job.

360
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,760
Those who say you have jumped the shark. Well, the shark has left the building when you start talking

361
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:16,640
about reality. Thanks a lot, man. Keep it real. All right. Chris, I want you to go over to podcastpickle.com.

362
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,720
And I want you to post that. And I want you to tell all the little pickleights, the pickleettes.

363
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,200
What you think, you know, there's so much negativity over there. Now be a big man, go over there

364
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:35,680
and post them exactly what you just said. Okay. More from the voice mail box. Hey, Adam, it's John.

365
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:43,840
You're fellow Surrey X-Pad, uh, stuck in the morning school on traffic hearing the, uh,

366
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:50,640
luxurious suburb of Gilford. Uh, one thing to be in this morning, congratulations on the BT deal.

367
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,800
That is fantastic. Looking forward to all the advantages that's going to bring me as a BT

368
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:03,200
internet user of the service. Uh, but was wondering this morning, uh, listening to Virgin,

369
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,800
if you're the big star, I was thinking maybe that was going to be your big announcement over the last.

370
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,880
So, well, that is a, is Virgin doing some kind of promotion about having a big star coming in.

371
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,040
That hadn't heard about that. We do listen to Virgin often in the morning.

372
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,000
Uh, it's the Christian no-connal breakfast show. I believe is what it's called.

373
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,320
Guys, okay, you know, he's functional. Let's put it that way. The music's good so that works,

374
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,560
but I was not aware they were bringing in a big star.

375
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:33,280
Last week that you were going to be coming back to the airways on Virgin UK.

376
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,480
Why would I want to do that? First of all, that's a real job. That means you got to show up every day.

377
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:45,280
I don't never work. Not with my travel schedule. Uh, uh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

378
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,840
And why would I want to go back to the airways and be restricted? Look at all, I can do, I can start

379
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,760
when I want. I can make it as long as short as I want. I can say what I want. I can do whatever I want.

380
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,080
I'm my own woman here. And that you were the big star that driving me nuts with this announcement.

381
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,360
I thought maybe you might actually come in and clean up their playlist.

382
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,400
Okay, God knows a sickie here in Brian Adams summer of 69 on that station.

383
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,000
They do play that a lot, don't they?

384
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,000
Anyway, as always, as most of you, you're listeners, a lot of the show.

385
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,560
Hope you're well. Looking forward to the next time the church is on and, uh, scruncher.

386
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,800
Yeah, my hi. No, a nice scruncher. Thank you.

387
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,240
Yeah, I'll get Patricia on tomorrow for sure. Hey, Adam, Chris from the Financial Aid podcast, you

388
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,120
with answers to listen to his questions about how to get the Adam Curry sound.

389
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,360
Oh, yeah, this is all about the Adam Curry sound.

390
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,240
Does it take a lot of money to get the Adam Curry sound? Or can it be done efficiently and

391
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,880
Adam sound comes partly from compression, partly from using a stereo condenser microphone.

392
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,520
And partly from his God-given talent and voice.

393
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,560
It has a some experts have said, a very wide sound.

394
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,000
If you're not using a stereo condenser microphone, a high LPR-40 or a compressor,

395
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,480
you can still get a similar sound here as hell.

396
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,080
Step one, using a audacity on the PC or Mac record some audio.

397
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,200
Be sure your mouth is close enough to the mic that you don't sound hollow with far away.

398
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,280
Depending on the microphone, this can be anywhere from an inch to half of foot.

399
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,000
Try to do it in a room that has a little or no echo.

400
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,080
Step two, compression is part of the mix, but normalization is even more important.

401
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,440
Select all of your audio. Under the effect of my new select compressor.

402
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,000
Crank up the compression to a 6-1 ratio by moving the slider, the shortest attack time possible,

403
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,960
and check the little box that says normalized to zero decibels.

404
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,480
Step three, split the track into two tracks,

405
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,200
and one track hard left and one track hard right.

406
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,520
This creates a wide stereo sound effect that sounds good and headphones and good speaker setups.

407
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,840
There are plenty of other options and things you can play with,

408
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,880
but these two settings can make a big difference in a little sound for free.

412
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,080
Runa, thanks Chris. You know, I agree with that partially.

413
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,360
Remember, I do this show in real time, in live, live format.

414
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,680
So it's in line and linearly, and we start at the beginning, and we end when we're done.

415
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,240
There's a lot to be said for recording that sound.

416
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,640
I mean, basically, I have an analog setup, you know, it's a tube processor.

417
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,880
Very hard to replicate, although a lot of the plug-ins for stuff like Pro Tools,

418
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,680
No Dacity, and Audition have gotten very, very good. You can get pretty damn close,

419
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:28,320
but I still do something, you know, there's nothing quite like doing it through an analog device.

420
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,400
That actually, I think kind of qualified as a

421
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:41,280
Tint-a-t-a-t-in foil. Tint-a-t-mo-mas. Tint-a-t-a-t-mo-il. Tint-a-t-mo-il.

422
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,880
Tint-a-t-a-l. Tint-a-l. Tint-a-l. Tint-a-l. Toil-it-t-mo-il.

423
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,040
And now it's time for the Tint-a-t foil hat moment.

424
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,720
At a zero, the area 51 group. Now we got a talking.

425
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:05,720
You keep using the 10-foil hat moment about degree subjects and, you know, that's okay.

426
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:13,720
You can expand the meaning of it, but on the little sense of about this because, well, being part of an organization called the Area 51 group,

427
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:24,720
the real meaning of the term is quite just doubling that in my psyche every time you play it when you're talking about 10 or something.

428
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,720
10-foil hat is worn by a conspiracy theorist.

429
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:35,720
They work 10-foil hats that don't go, because they think it's about keeping the government from scanning our brains or something.

430
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,720
Now, like I said, you can do it any more with the term.

431
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,720
We need a better term than nerdy moment or some crap like that, that's fine, but I just want to hear you about it.

432
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,720
I think you know that's a really mean conspiracy theory, guys.

433
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,720
You know, like somebody who believes in the moonlight, it's a fake jerk.

434
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,720
Never mind.

435
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,720
And, folder, scruncher?

436
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,720
Okay.

437
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,720
Yeah, no, I acknowledge that.

438
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:07,720
Of course, the 10-foil hat is, but it's all, you know, 10-foil hat is not just useful for area 51, like conspiracies,

439
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,720
and the government being able to scan your brain.

440
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,720
It's also very useful for ELF emissions from my monitor.

441
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,720
So I do wear my 10-foil hat frequently, of course.

442
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,720
And whenever in the air, I mean, you're blasting the 100 watts of power when I'm flying.

443
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
I'm talking on the radio.

444
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,720
You know, I always have little 10-foil hat folded over on the top of my nagging underneath my headset.

445
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,720
It's critical, of course.

446
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,720
But it does kind of stand for nerdyness and geekiness and electric bits and bobs.

447
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:40,720
And I think that it's for that reason that we can kind of let it slide a little bit into the geeky realm, if you will.

448
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,720
And this is just no, no.

449
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,720
Yeah, it feels right.

450
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
It does.

451
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,720
And I hope you don't mind me kind of adopting the 10-foil hat for some of the nerdy moments on the Charlie.

452
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,720
I hope you're okay with that.

453
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:59,720
And by the way, I'd love to do many more official certified 10-foil hat moments.

454
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,720
I just need more conspiracies to be sent in.

455
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,720
You know, a lot of the show is determined by you and what you send me.

456
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,720
I had a little sense, say, a moment there earlier.

457
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Pardon me for that.

458
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
I did want to share with you.

459
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,720
I found a new sensei-o sensation.

460
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,720
I'm really working on it.

461
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
I'm working on the taste.

462
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
I've got some ideas for that coming up soon.

463
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:26,720
I'm going to try this flavored sugar substitute called Splenda.

464
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,720
But I've now, Patricia bought this frothing thing.

465
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
And you pour a little bit of milk in it.

466
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
And it's almost like a butter churn-only miniature.

467
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,720
And you just pump that side, that bad boy up and down.

468
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,720
You pump it, you pump it, you pump it, you pump it, and then all of a sudden it becomes frothy.

469
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Pour a little bit in, then the coffee, and then the rest.

470
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,720
And it's good.

471
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,720
I'll have to get a picture of the throthing, the frothing frother.

472
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,720
It's really, it's no more than a plastic cup, like a tumbler almost.

473
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,720
With a lid and in the lid it's this little plunger.

474
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,720
And even better, you can take it even one step further.

475
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,720
You can froth it with the, I do 2% milk, which throths less good.

476
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,720
Then 1% milk, skim milk.

477
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,720
That froth is really well.

478
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,720
Froth.

479
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
What a nice word, froth.

480
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,720
I'll pay me touch my froth just a little bit.

481
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:27,720
If you froth it, and then you stick the cup in the microwave for about 25 seconds, it gets warm and really frothy.

482
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,720
And it's really enhanced the senseo experience, I have to say.

483
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,720
So if you have senseo at this point, remember this is a non-paid endorsement.

484
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,720
I just do it because I love it, because I love the coffee.

485
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
Give that a shot.

486
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,720
And I'll try, we're going to try out some of that flavor stuff as well, to get the perfect combination.

487
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,720
Hi Adam, it's Phil here to South here from Somset.

488
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
I'm calling in again.

489
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,720
I just listening to what you are responding to saying about some iTunes.

490
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,720
I had exactly the same experience.

491
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:07,720
The problem is, I think, is that because they've reconfigured it and made it so different.

492
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,720
Nine times at a time, it's not going to just replace iTunes.

493
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,720
Just index everything and it all be good.

494
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,720
My solution, I came up with was to basically delete everything that's not iTunes music.

495
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,720
You know, libraries, playlists, all that kind of Milwaukee, just delete that out of your music directory.

496
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,720
And just import everything back in, install iTunes, import everything back in, everything works fine.

497
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,720
Because it divides everything up into podcasts and audio books.

498
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,720
And that just got a whole new way to do anything.

499
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,720
So if any listeners are having problems with iTunes, that's really the way to do it.

500
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,720
You just got to basically take everything away.

501
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,720
Before I go, I just like to big up my daughter's podcast.

502
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,720
This baby podcast by Happy South.

503
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,720
And it's a great show.

504
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,720
She plays lots of, like, music, lots of podcasts, music.

505
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,720
And she's really cool, which is 2014.

506
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
Okay.

507
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
Thanks a lot, dude.

508
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,720
It's a bunch of you.

509
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
Ah.

510
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,720
The scrunchers have it today.

511
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,720
You should tell them what the URL is of your daughter's podcast.

512
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,720
Sounds good.

513
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Is she on the podcast delivery network yet?

514
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,720
Pot show or where's just going to be the URL?

515
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
That's excellent.

516
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,720
Very, very nice.

517
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,720
Yeah.

518
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
It seems to be a lot of problems with iTunes 7.

519
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
A lot of people get confused as to how it works.

520
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,720
I have actually not upgraded myself.

521
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,720
Because we're doing right now, we're, I've seen it work.

522
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:33,720
Work yesterday, we're enabling, we're going to have this video.podshow.com.

523
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,720
Keep your eye on that URL.

524
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,720
Some stuff is going to happen there for sure.

525
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,720
And what we're enabling now is that you can subscribe to,

526
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,720
YouTube and Google video.

527
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,720
And it'll play in our dashboard in the player.

528
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,720
Which is pretty cool, actually.

529
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,720
So we'll have the top 20 YouTube videos, the top 20 Google videos.

530
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
And just a whole bunch of stuff that's coming.

531
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,720
And not to forget the top 20 podshow videos.

532
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,720
There's a lot of video content being uploaded.

533
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,720
Remember, you know, there's no limits if you're running into,

534
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,720
you know, I think with, like with with YouTube,

535
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,720
there's a hundred meg limit or 10 minute limit,

536
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,720
which I found a bit discouraging because I, you know,

537
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,720
I wanted to also upload my stuff to YouTube and I actually couldn't.

538
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,720
Or even worse, it would upload all the way.

539
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,720
And then it would say, now it was too big.

540
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,720
It's not a lot.

541
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,720
That's not up 150 megs.

542
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,720
And then they don't even convert it.

543
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,720
And I asked about New Orleans a couple of shows ago.

544
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,720
And I got a beautiful piece of feedback.

545
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,720
There's some great stuff happening in Louisiana.

546
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,720
Hey Adam, this is Patrick Richardson.

547
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,720
He, we're talking about New Orleans day of the day.

548
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,720
And I just wanted to tell you, yeah.

549
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
I'm actually into Orleans today.

550
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,720
They are a bit of operational and fully functional.

551
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Monday night football starts next week in the super dome.

552
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,720
So it's at the interesting game.

553
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,720
I'm actually in town for meeting my corporation,

554
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,720
or corporation decided we're going to have our,

555
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,720
our managers meeting in New Orleans

556
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,720
to help stimulate the economy.

557
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,720
And the hammering you here behind me is,

558
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,720
have it set for humanity projects.

559
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,720
We took one day out, more actually helping go home

560
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,720
through musicians and musicians' village.

561
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,720
So the companies are interested in doing this.

562
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,720
They can contact habitat for humanity

563
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,720
and figure out how they can help soon.

564
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,720
Talk to you later.

565
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Folder.

566
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,720
Right on dude.

567
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,720
Excellent.

568
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,720
Did he say Oracle Corporation?

569
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,720
Fantastic.

570
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,720
I love hearing that.

571
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,720
I wonder if they had a big, if they had a big office down there,

572
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,720
maybe.

573
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
That's cool.

574
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
I like it when big companies do,

575
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
you know, things like that.

576
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,720
No matter what, no matter what capacity they do it.

577
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
I didn't know Monday night football started from,

578
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,720
from the super dome on this coming Monday.

579
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
That's great.

580
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,720
So yeah, it sounds like things are definitely moving

581
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,720
and you should get your ass down there.

582
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
Spend some money.

583
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,720
Help out.

584
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
Spend some money.

585
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
Do both.

586
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
If you can.

587
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,720
I was running.

588
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,720
I was getting the next set of calls all lined up.

589
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,720
Remember that caller yesterday on episode 464.

590
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,720
We said that he did not like David Epolito.

591
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,720
Maybe it was 463.

592
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
I don't remember.

593
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,720
Boy, that sparked off a lot of phone calls.

594
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,720
Hey.

595
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Adam.

596
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,720
This is John.

597
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,720
That call you had today about Dave Epolito or the guitar man.

598
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,720
Come on.

599
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,720
I mean, I disagree with him.

600
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
A lot of things.

601
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
I email him all the time.

602
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,720
We're having quite a bit of a debate.

603
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,720
He's taking my button.

604
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
The argument.

605
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,720
But that's the side of the point.

606
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,720
The straight he doesn't have count is ridiculous.

607
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
He's great.

608
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,720
His music is great.

609
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,720
His players are great.

610
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,720
Their guitar playing is great.

611
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
He's really, really good.

612
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,720
And I would just love to be able to get down in New York or up to New York.

613
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,720
You are going over to New York to see him play.

614
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,720
And I don't know what this guy's problem is.

615
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,720
And the guy said he went to a Bob Dylan concert.

616
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
The state's there.

617
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
It was bad concerts.

618
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,720
I've been to three or four Bob Dylan concerts.

619
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,720
Every other one is different.

620
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Some of the good.

621
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,720
Some of that sort of removed Bob as in.

622
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,720
This guy's an idiot.

623
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,720
All right.

624
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
Well, I guess that's not nice.

625
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,720
But wow.

626
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,720
I can't believe he would say this.

627
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,720
Somebody doesn't have talent.

628
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,720
Just because he doesn't agree with his politics.

629
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
That's crazy.

630
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,720
Oh, well.

631
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,720
And then, you know.

632
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,720
All right.

633
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
I'll talk to you later.

634
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,720
Bye.

635
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,720
He's crunchier full of scruncher.

636
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,720
And then our buddy Jeff Smith checked in.

637
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720
Hey, Adam.

638
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
This is Jeff Smith.

639
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,720
Just cruising listen to four, six, four.

640
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,720
And listen to the guy go on about David at the lead.

641
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,720
And I just had to correct him on one thing.

642
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,720
He was saying that David at the lead was stuff is nothing but parody.

643
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,720
Actually.

644
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,720
parody is kind of what I do, which is spoofing and existing.

645
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,720
Song or piece and sort of doing something.

646
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,720
Basically copying it.

647
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
Three.

648
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,720
I think what he meant to say is he's doing satire, which is more social commentary.

649
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,720
Yes.

650
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,720
Right on with you thinking that he's a great social commentator.

651
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,720
So, hey, guys.

652
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
I was just wrong in his words.

653
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,720
But otherwise.

654
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,720
Rock and roll.

655
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,720
All right.

656
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,720
Talk to you later.

657
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Bye.

658
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,720
Thank you.

659
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,720
Yeah.

660
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,720
I think what really got that guy is that I compared David at the leado to Bob Dylan.

661
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,720
I said, this is the Bob Dylan of our time.

662
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,720
You know, he's bringing us the lyrics that are relevant.

663
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,720
And it really is about what he's saying in the song.

664
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,720
But even that much about the song, and still he's got very, very catchy tunes of the time.

665
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
For now.

666
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,720
Well, there's one person who was bound to be really pissed off by all of this.

667
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,720
He hit him.

668
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,720
This is Bob Dylan County.

669
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
Good talking.

670
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,720
But I mean, that guy's fucking bitch.

671
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
It's to Dylan.

672
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
I apologize profusely.

673
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
I really do.

674
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,720
Okay.

675
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
I'm that was the nice version.

676
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,720
Here's the mean version.

677
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
Go for it.

678
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,720
Hi.

679
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,720
This is Lockjaw.

680
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,720
The podcast junkie.

681
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,720
Adam.

682
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,720
I just want to thank you for sticking up for David at the leado.

683
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,720
I hope I'm putting that scruncher in his place.

684
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
You know, probably this is guys full of shit.

685
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,720
He's using that scrunched up toilet paper to wipe a hole in the ground because he does not know the difference.

686
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,720
I challenge him personally to go to that guitarman.com download episode.

687
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
And listen to it.

688
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,720
And then call the DSC back and tell me that David at the leado.

689
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:22,720
Only right shallow funny songs and doesn't know what he's talking about.

690
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:29,720
Because in that episode, he plays his own stuff and he really lays his soul there at the world.

691
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,720
And it's one of my favorite episodes.

692
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,720
So do it.

693
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,720
Call back.

694
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,720
Let me know what you think.

695
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
Bye.

696
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,720
Okay.

697
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
I'm sure he will.

698
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,720
I'm sure we'll be hearing from him.

699
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,720
No doubt about it.

700
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,720
That guitarman.com is where you can find David.

701
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,720
David, a polito, his podcast is called.

702
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,720
I love the company, which I think is a very interesting title.

703
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,720
And I actually taught them.

704
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,720
I talked to him about a girl con dream to have sit.

705
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,720
Hello.

706
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
Hello, dear.

707
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,720
Thank you.

708
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,720
And nice shake.

709
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
Thank you.

710
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,720
Just needed that.

711
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,720
We come on the show tomorrow.

712
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,720
Okay.

713
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,720
It tastes good.

714
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,720
Thank you.

715
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,720
Nice.

716
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,720
It's a lady Patricia.

717
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,720
We'll be on the show tomorrow.

718
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,720
That was I say.

719
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,720
No, yeah.

720
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,720
He had Sid Bernstein do that promo.

721
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
Sid Bernstein.

722
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,720
Music industry legend.

723
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,720
Sid Bernstein.

724
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,720
We brought the Beatles to America.

725
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,720
And it looks like he may actually get some kind of show going with Sid Bernstein.

726
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,720
There was just a dream I had.

727
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,720
How cool would the beat have Sid Bernstein talking about Podsake music?

728
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,720
I think we could really really go far with that.

729
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:43,720
Today, the fifth episode of Shadow Falls drops Shadow Falls.ponshow.com.

730
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,720
It is our original audio drama.

731
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,720
It's theater of the mind.

732
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,720
It's very much in line with the audio books.

733
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,720
Scott Sigler, of course, being the Sultan of that.

734
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,720
And there's a lot more people are seeing this as a very interesting new creative outlet.

735
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,720
And audience are flocking to it.

736
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,720
That's so cool.

737
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,720
And it's not just about the show itself.

738
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,720
It's about the story, the backstory, about the actors, about the writing.

739
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,720
There's communities really evolving around this stuff.

740
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,720
And I find it incredibly exciting because this is what it really started out with for me with the iPod.

741
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,720
Even before I was thinking of podcasting, I really wanted to listen to audio books.

742
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:29,720
And if you want to hear a great example, listen to John Stewart's audio book version of his book.

743
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,720
Very well produced.

744
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,720
Just funny and interesting and more of a comedic piece, not just a dry read of a book.

745
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,720
And people are doing some very, very interesting things with that night.

746
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,720
And I want to support that as much of a hint.

747
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
Crap.

748
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,720
Do it by playing a lot of music.

749
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,720
I'm going to have my shake.

750
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,720
You listen to this.

751
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,720
Six months ago, the seven son potty of book trilogy began.

752
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,720
Seven clones were ripped away from their normal lives to hunt a ruthless criminal.

753
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,720
The man they were cloned from, the man who masterminded the assassination of the president.

754
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,720
You met John, father Thomas, killed Roy 2.0, Michael, and the other beta clones.

755
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,720
It was always story.

756
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,720
It wasn't real.

757
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,720
But for one night, it will be.

758
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:20,720
On Saturday, September 23rd, be a part of podcast history.

764
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,720
And you'll see fiction given dimension.

765
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:02,720
In-world, you'll be able to step into the warm cloning chamber from book one where the clones were given birth.

766
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,720
You can see the clones.

767
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,720
You can be a clone.

768
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,720
It's a new life there in second life.

769
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:15,720
The party starts at 7 p.m. second lifetime, that's 10 p.m. Eastern, 7 p.m. Pacific.

00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,720
You can find it at J.C. Hutchins.net.

782
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,720
And at audiobooks.com.

783
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,720
Interesting idea, I like it.

784
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,720
I really do.

785
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,720
And as I was listening to that, I was thinking, wouldn't it be interesting to recreate shadow falls?

786
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:19,720
The place, some of the buildings, the roads, the diner, the woods.

787
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,720
Wouldn't it be interesting to recreate that in second life?

788
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:29,720
I would gladly relinquish all creation building rights to pod shows island.

789
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:34,720
So when we're willing to turn that into shadow falls, I would do that in a freaking heart beat.

790
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,720
I'd have to get Brittany Mason's approval, of course.

791
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,720
But how cool would that be?

792
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,720
Yeah.

793
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,720
Those of you that are really into shadow falls into the story.

794
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,720
If you've ever checked out second life, it could be a very interesting experiment.

795
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,720
Something really, really fun to do.

796
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,720
I'm just saying, you know.

797
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,720
Hey Adam, Paul Barry here from window to the magic.

798
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,720
And I was wondering if you could do me a huge favor.

799
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:02,720
Now I realize that this is not something that you want to get in the habit of doing on your show.

800
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,720
But hopefully you'll make a one time exception.

801
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:13,720
My girlfriend, Terry Woodard of the Little Reds Writing Hood podcast, is celebrating her birthday on Thursday, September 21st.

802
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,720
Wait a minute.

803
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,720
Hold on.

804
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,720
Hold on.

805
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,720
Hold on.

806
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,720
Hold on.

807
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,720
Hold on.

808
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,720
I just want to make a general observation.

809
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
Do you remember Toby Radloth, the original nerd, who was on MTV back in the day?

810
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,720
I'm Toby Radloth, the original nerd.

811
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,720
Does this guy sound like him or what?

812
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:38,720
My girlfriend, Terry Woodard of the Little Reds Writing Hood podcast, is celebrating her birthday on Thursday, September 21st.

813
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,720
And due to reasons beyond our control, I cannot be there together with her.

814
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:51,720
Terry listens to the Charlie every day, and she's a big supporter of podsafe music and podcasting in general.

815
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:57,720
As a matter of fact, she just finished interviewing Mark and James about the writing of Shadow Falls,

816
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,720
which she will be airing on her podcast on the 25th of this month.

817
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,720
Anyway, I just thought we could make her day a little brighter.

818
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:13,720
If you played one of her favorite podsafe music artists, Amy Ayers, and her song One More Day on the Daily source code.

819
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:25,720
Now I love Terry very much, and I know that it would just make her day if you and I and the rest of the world of podcasting could wish her a happy birthday in this fashion.

820
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:31,720
So Adam, thank you very much in advance, and Terry, I love you, babe.

821
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:17,720
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you.

822
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:47,720
And I need you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you,

823
00:41:47,720 --> 00:42:17,720
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you,

824
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,720
I do it

825
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,720
And I need you

826
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,720
Why don't I tell you

827
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,720
And why don't you

828
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,720
I'll tell you my truth

829
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,720
To the world

830
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,720
Because I need you

831
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,720
And why don't I tell you

832
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,720
And why don't you

833
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,720
I'll tell you my truth

834
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,720
To the world

835
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,720
Because I need you

836
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,720
When you are by my side

837
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,720
And why don't I write us

838
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,720
When you are by my side

839
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,720
And why don't I write us

840
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,720
I'll tell you

841
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,720
And why don't you tell me

842
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,720
And why don't you tell me

843
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,720
And why don't you tell me

844
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,720
And then you

845
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,720
Why don't I tell you

846
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,720
Why don't you know

847
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,720
