Delta Sierra Charlie 389er.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The glove compartment is an accurate name.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Everybody knows it.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So I'm proposing a swift murdering train.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It comes behind its door.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
There's nothing to keep my fingers down

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and all I find are souvenirs from better times

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
before the gleam.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Over-tailed life's fading days to find

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
yourself a better life.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I was searching for some legal document.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Is the blame be down on the hood

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
when I stumble upon pictures I tried to forget

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and that's how this idea was drilled into my head.

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Because it's too important to stay the way it's been.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
There's no way how our love did slowly fade

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and now it's gone.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's like it wasn't there at all.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm here I was just like a disappointment ever come.

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm quiet.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Why no way got out of my head.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,000
There's no way how our love did slowly fade

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and now it's gone.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's like it wasn't there at all.

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm here I was just like a disappointment ever come.

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:04:02,000
When I'm lying all night when I'm lying all night.

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,420
and come in if you want that's cab for cutie title and registration please

35
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,200
from the pod safe music network actually turned on to that song by martina

36
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,000
butler Michael butler rock and roll geek show his daughter martina does a

37
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,160
show called emo girl talk and she's actually doing something for a demo and

38
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,800
she played this song and I was posted in the demo for like man I kind of

39
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,760
dig that so I hope you appreciate how I look today for once I'm actually

41
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,120
off my jacket an actual black jacket you know not like a leather thing or

42
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,240
that diesel jacket that I have or no I'm I'm prepped and ready I'm back

43
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,120
actually from a great meeting in London with Ben Fervayan who is the CEO of

44
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,160
British telecom going to tell you all about it because I'm very excited about

45
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,760
about what at first of all how cool is that I left the house at what I

46
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:17,320
leave 11 15 11 15 gotten a cab took me to the station and you know right

47
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,360
through you know that's 25 30 minute train ride I was I was perfect timing I've

48
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,440
got it down now see instead of waiting 20 minutes I can get there right on

49
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:31,000
time get my ticket hop on with just moments to spare quick cab ride from a

50
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,680
waterloo station to Newgate Street where the BT Center is and you know

51
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,320
have a meeting then come back same thing actually I scored a oh man it was so

52
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,640
nice I saw that I had like eight minutes to spare getting off it getting out of

53
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,160
the cab getting ready to get on the train on the way home and I'm like okay

54
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,040
Burger King I can smell it I got myself a nice water meal hopped on the on the

55
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,520
train and ate it in first class and stank up the whole place all the way home

56
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,520
and literally just got back and figured I would share my experiences with you

57
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,360
guys because that's part of my fun at least for the daily source code but first

58
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,240
just briefly about last night as I've been starting to understand even better

59
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,840
how to utilize what I'm now calling the user interface of the future some

60
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,080
call it a virtual world some call it a game you know it is second life but I'm

61
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,440
really learning how to utilize this thing as a communications tool

62
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,400
yesterday in the pod show palace casino theater can you believe I actually got

63
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,480
that I had a couple people over and you can actually just sit down I can play a

64
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,600
video and so I played some stuff that work on it pod show some trailers and

65
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,960
some other things that you'll be seeing soon this is just like my little closed

66
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,840
beta to gauge reaction but it was so easy to do this and to have people

67
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,920
commenting while the video was rolling you know it really isn't interface I

68
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,560
found something else which is this multi-chair thing now you just have to

69
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,920
visualize this because remember this is just about connecting with people when

70
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,000
you're doing it in a very visual way and this multi-chair thing you sit down

71
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,520
in each person that sits down in the chair a new chair appears and I think

72
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,400
there's a max I saw the max yesterday at around 12 I think but it's really

73
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,160
good because everyone's sitting and it kind of controlled not moving about because

74
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,040
when you get too many avatars too many people as it were roaming around

75
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,640
then everything slows down and we had a real good conversation and there was you

76
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,840
know as I said there was like 12 people in the chairs people sitting around

77
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,720
and it was you know we actually got some chat going on we're talking about the BBC

78
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,880
was doing and I knew some of the people I didn't know others and then just as the

79
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,080
conversation was kind of you know at a certain point you have too many people for

80
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,840
a conversation which is also and also be a problem with anyone can just come into your

81
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:53,800
virtual space I saw that Emma was online so I sent her an instant message I say

82
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,280
Emma we got like the whole gang over here come on over I got I got your pole your

83
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:05,800
stripper pole and sure enough Emma came over it took her about five minutes because she

84
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,920
said she was with another customer I'm not quite sure what that means but I'm going to

85
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:17,240
leave it at that so I paid her $500 blind and dollars and and of course on various web

86
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:24,040
blogs you'll see pictures of that fine gathering yesterday at the castle oh my goodness

87
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,040
that was fun though but it was good and yeah even talk a little bit about British telecom

88
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,360
by my meetings today it really it's a it's a great interface it it works very well for me

89
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,080
in limited quality quantities because it does get a bit you know overbearing and

90
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,400
just a bit after a while so I don't have a fully prepped show I haven't even listened to the

91
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,360
voicemail message box this morning because it was just so much to do and get ready and

92
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,240
I actually had prepared the cast blaster demo or the cast blaster machine which I used for

93
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:02,760
cast blaster as my demo machine because I was going to show the the CEO cast blaster of course

94
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,600
but also pod show plus and the pod cast delivery network so you know lots of lots of

95
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,080
preparatory work getting it just right and I wanted to leave on time so it could be in the lobby

96
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,840
at one for the 130 meeting to be able to configure their BT open zone because of course with a

97
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,880
company like British telecom if you use their internal systems you know Gmail is blocked Yahoo is

98
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,080
blocked no Yahoo isn't blocked actually but Gmail is blocked so you can't retrieve password

99
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,840
easily and all this stuff so I just wanted to get on the BT open zone which of course they also

100
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,520
have in the building completely separate network and just be able to do the demo from there to show

101
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:44,760
what we were getting into together before all that though there are some things I have to admit

102
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,200
that take precedence over the CEO of British telecom.

103
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:06,120
all right he's up to tricks now now he's up to high jinx and I like it so I'm curious

104
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:12,440
here is comic strip program from comic strip block.com I just wanted to tell you that I called

105
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:19,320
London speech radio station LBC that you can also hear in Guildford last Sunday to ask about

106
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,320
something the presenter whose name is Ian Lee who is also a grand son of the actor who played

107
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,960
in Star Wars and by the way I mentioned you Adam and here is what was he's reaction.

108
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,640
it's another carry reference this is I don't carry. Do you know here?

109
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,680
yeah who is he?

110
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,680
excuse please don't let the road any. I don't carry lives at the road yeah.

111
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,120
I don't carry yes do you mean madam carry?

112
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,040
no I ain't Adam carry. Hasan.

113
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,600
no Adam. Madam Kira.

114
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:10,120
close but not close enough. Okay so Adam carry is a guy who is in Guildford.

115
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,160
he lives in Guildford yes. He invented podcasting.

116
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,920
he invented podcasting.

117
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,840
yes wow.

118
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,880
so it now you know who invented podcasting.

119
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,240
Madam carry.

120
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,680
no Adam carry.

121
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,520
Adam carry.

122
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,680
okay yeah anyway thanks.

123
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,880
okay thank you.

124
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,840
bye bye.

125
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,440
that was a call from Germany.

126
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,560
Adam carry.

127
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,720
so you can hear Adam that apparently some radio presenters still don't know who the

128
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,240
fuck are you?

129
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,200
maybe some post-save music artists could write a song who the fuck is carry.

130
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,520
something like who the fuck is Alice.

131
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,680
ciao.

132
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,960
you know comics are blogger you are my hero dude.

133
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:07,000
I think you should call every single radio program in the UK and record this stuff.

134
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,880
and every single time you get you get the host to mention my name on the air.

135
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,000
I'll pay you five hundred linden dollars okay every single time.

136
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,200
be happy to do it. I'm happy to have you terrorize these guys. Fantastic.

137
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,720
okay onto business then.

138
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:33,240
so it's no secret that we've been thinking about setting up pod show UK and part of the reason is

139
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,000
besides the fact that I like being here and because my girls are here too you know I kind of

140
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,800
get the tag along with the family and we like it here and there's a thriving podcast community

141
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,880
which happens to speak more or less the same language as we do in the United States.

142
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:55,000
despite all our differences and more on a future yanks versus the brit segment for that.

143
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,320
but we met with a whole bunch of the podcast community.

144
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,280
some of the thought leaders at our draft and darts not too long ago.

145
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,160
not everybody could make it unfortunately but at least we got a good

146
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,560
good vibe for what is going on and a lot of passion a lot of excitement.

147
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,440
and in order to open up something in any or any other office for that matter believe it or not

148
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,160
you know the the eight almost nine million dollars and of course there's the the money

149
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,840
runner I put in. so let's say the ten million dollars that that has been put into pod show

150
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:32,040
is just not enough to open up another office with five to eight people in in London.

151
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,720
or anywhere in in the United Kingdom for that matter just look at the exchange rate for one

152
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,960
but also it was never really in our plan to do this until you know we had significant revenues

153
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,320
and now a lot of things are coming together a little bit faster than we thought some of them

154
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:55,800
simultaneously when it rains at pores kind of stuff. and so we were really looking for as we

155
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,880
do in the US as well for two types of partners one is an advertising agency who has clients

156
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:07,160
of course and during our week here we met with several of them several who have US companies

157
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:14,680
have a British annexes and vice versa. as well as distribution now for us distribution is

158
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:21,160
well it's a whole bunch of things but it's anywhere that we can feature podcasts and hopefully ours

159
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:29,080
as well not just ours but yeah we'd like to put ours up there and an example that is iTunes

160
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,640
pod finder I actually haven't seen the new pod finder thought I was supposed to come out yesterday

161
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:40,120
it should be up so that's distribution now on pod finder we promote rarely promote a pod show

162
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:47,160
podcast it's really to promote podcasting in general but you can you can see what you know what the

163
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:54,280
the obvious types of partners are for us. excuse me since I haven't had a freaking drop all day

164
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:02,360
so with British telecom it's a very interesting company they do not have a mobile arm even though

165
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:09,480
they are the default telephony carrier here in the UK and beyond the UK but most prompt

166
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:16,920
predominantly here in the UK they're very interested in in y-max no secret they're coming out with

167
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:26,520
they an IPTV service offering and the company is although often seen is a little dusty and

168
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:32,280
old and stodgy you know they definitely have an attitude about where they want to go and it was

169
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,680
only a couple weeks ago no I was more than that actually it was about two months ago when I was

170
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:43,800
last days I was in San Francisco the last time that we were asked to come and meet with

171
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,960
a number of key executives of British telecom what happened to be in Silicon Valley so we did that

172
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,200
and I don't think they were quite expecting what we had to say but when we basically had

173
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,440
laid it all out they said wow you know we should see if we can work together because this is very

174
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:06,360
timely we're coming out with new products etc and so we've been talking meeting some negotiation

175
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,800
not you know we we don't like to negotiate really really long and drawn out because if if the

176
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,520
intent of a contract is not the same from both sides no amount of paper is going to make anything

177
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,240
right so you know you try to avoid those situations usually it's a bad sign if there's a lot of

178
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:29,960
back and forth on a contract at least that's my experience so we so the out that we're down to the

179
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:36,920
wire here and the final piece was for me to meet with the CEO Ben Forvian who was a Dutch guy

180
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:47,240
and to seal the deal I guess so we had exactly 20 minutes scheduled this is very typical for a CEO

181
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:55,800
by the way 20 minutes and since I'm the default pod show guy I was off to go and do it

182
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:03,000
Ben Forvian interesting although I was pretty sure I'd never met him before I know of him and

183
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,880
have seen him on television shows he's a Dutch executive he ran parts of a KPN the Dutch

184
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:18,600
to a telephone company he was CEO of loosen technologies he also worked at I believe endimole

185
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,400
Holland media group he's one of these guys who's definitely been around and has been there

186
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:29,400
there's someone calling me what's that no sorry that's KJ he wants to talk about the meeting

187
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:39,240
we'll have to call him right back so when I came in you know and I was kind of prepared to

188
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,480
you know how to you only have 20 minutes I just want to make a really good impression that's why

189
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,800
I was all gossiping up and Patricia helped me of course maybe look pretty and makes me also confident

190
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:54,680
and I know that he had just received a the equivalent of a night hood from from the Dutch queen

191
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,240
so I'm already to congratulate him on on this prestigious award and I figured I'm not going

192
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,640
to speak Dutch right off the battle at him choose the language so yeah nice to meet you Adam Croix

193
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,160
oh nice to meet you we've actually met before well I guess I'd make a big impression on you then

194
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:17,320
huh like oh shit this is not good but he's a really very awake

195
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,760
aware kind of guy you know and so he immediately is pushing on you know so I got the cue

196
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,480
I'm into my rap about what pod show is what we've been talking with his team about and all the

197
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,920
guys were there you know we worked a lot with Steven and Gavin and so you know they were in the room

198
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:38,200
I couldn't just tell they're like oh man this is it's got to go right and I and what was

199
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,560
fascinating is so I took him through pod show plus and he's like oh yeah I really like this yeah

200
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,200
this is good so I'm still in couch potato mode kind of said well you know you couldn't configure this

201
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,480
so you can listen or watch things at your office or say well so I can have this set up so that I

202
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,120
can get stuff at home when I come home from a busy day at work and it'll say here's what I've

203
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,000
collected for you after a busy day of work I said well we'll have to put the words in the busy day

204
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,560
at work part but yes exactly what it does and we you know went ahead and create he said oh I'm

205
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,880
interested in cooking so I love it when when people try and break a demo like that so I you know

206
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:18,840
once straight to the director he pulled out a vegan the vegan cooking podcast actually

207
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,840
put that in build Ben's test channel and he's like okay so but what if I want to make something I

208
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,960
say well I'm glad you asked so I whip up class blaster he's like hmm hmm so I give a quick run

209
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,720
through when I say but you know instead of explaining all this let's just record a podcast

210
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,040
so I hit record and actually I think and this was just through the microphone on the

211
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,080
Chiba so it sounded like shit but I had to overmodulate because you think the microphone's bad

212
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:51,000
on the Chiba the speaker is even worse it's like it's almost like an iPod speaker only that someone

213
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,280
someone you when you don't jam into your ear he let's listen to I think we have that test podcast we

214
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:06,040
created on poppin it up now it's actually on the podcast delivery network so here we go

215
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:17,240
is it playing a crap shoot I have to I'm sorry all right I'll continue to talk well my

216
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:25,400
engineer actually does some reconfiguration here so and you know and he and so I show this

217
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,960
cast blaster piece and we record it and I show him how easily gets shot right up to the

218
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:36,360
right up to the to the pdn and he's like okay I like this this is really good so I can do

219
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,480
this how about video I say well you know obviously you know we add the video component to cast blaster

220
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,080
and you do the same thing and you still have to provide your cameras like no no this is great

221
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,680
he said this is one of the biggest things we learned at end-a-mole and end-a-mole of course

222
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:56,280
is famous for the big brother program he said is the results that we achieved by hiring regular

223
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:02,120
people and not actors to be in the television shows that that was brilliance and I'm like dude you

224
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:08,120
are a visionary that's for sure he'll I think I've got it wired up so okay so whatever we say now is

225
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:13,400
okay yep and then we can have we can add uh so we can add a drum to that if you want yeah okay

226
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,040
but that's the voice and now how do I do a video see there he goes yeah the video is guys we're so

227
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:24,040
smart he's straight straight to the video amazing okay so that's all we did basically you can

228
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,760
hear him jabbering away and he was like boom boom boom question after question and then he says

229
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,160
I like it this is great what what what what what what's the deal what are we doing and then the guy

230
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,800
said well basically you know we we have the deal we just you know without saying and it's like okay

231
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,040
we just want your blessing and he's like and and I immediately jumped in and said yeah this is

232
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:48,040
actually just the courtesy call you know just say hi and uh and he said this is fantastic this can

233
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,040
be bigger than dream works I want to talk about it tomorrow to the shareholders and I was like oh

234
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,680
anyway I think we're in business and of course until it's signed in blood

235
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:04,440
which means we have a partner and I think it's a damn good one they are really they've you know

236
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,800
without going into all the details of our agreement of course hope you don't mind

237
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:16,360
there's going to be a lot of push for marketing for podcasting it will not be exclusive to BT

238
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,080
customers only it'll be for everybody of course there'll be tons of BT branding

239
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:27,480
which is obvious for obvious reasons and and we're really going to push this to the forefront

240
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:34,760
and I think in in combination with the BBC who are educating people almost daily now on on what

241
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:43,880
podcasting is I think we will really kick some ass now will also be creating show specifically

242
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,320
for the for the UK market you know so what we have budgets and you know please don't go

243

244
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,240
that we all want to do just let me you know give us a few weeks to get everything squared away

245
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:08,120
but I'm so happy I'm even more happy now that we had a chance to meet so many cool people at the
