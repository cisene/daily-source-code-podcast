Delta Sierra Charlie 409.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,560
It's early morning Thursday in San Francisco, California.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,520
And I'm watching World Cup Soccer.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,360
Right now Ghana is leading the US by 1 to 0.

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,280
Not feeling really good about that, particularly this early in the morning.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,000
So what do we do?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,480
Well we play a song that all American males will play when they're feeling a little bit

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,440
down and when they're behind because this is the truth.

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:11,140
I take a look at my enormous penis and my troubles start to melt into a bow, I take a

13
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:18,680
look at my enormous penis and the happy times are coming to stay.

14
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:25,440
I got a saying and I dance when I glancing my pants and the feeling like a sunshine

15
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:33,720
I take a look at high enormous penis and everything is going my way.

16
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,720
So what if we can't play soccer?

17
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,000
We got big spouts.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,280
With $16 billion worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
radio content in my ears.

20
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,120
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

21
00:01:50,120 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm just a kid that I'm crazy.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,800
I got hand in the devil's land on home.

23
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:15,720
Never had milk and honey that tastes so bad on home.

24
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:24,440
All I had mama's day behaving about shutting this stuff just the west of the wall.

25
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:38,200
You never understand, so just take my hand and put it on your mouth again, all your

26
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:47,000
mama's gone, all your time, all your time, all your time, all your time, all your time,

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,100
ehhh

30
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:58,100
I've got to land in the devil's hand on

31
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:05,100
Never had milk on a hornet that tastes so bland

32
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:12,100
All the hot momma's day to have a new bowl

33
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,100
Struggling bad stuff just a west of the wall

34
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,100
It made me wonder how strong it is

35
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:26,100
So does it take my hand

36
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,100
And put it on your mouth on the ground

37
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,100
All your men always laugh

38
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,100
All owns a safe mind

39
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,100
And put it on your mouth on the ground

40
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,100
And put it on your mouth on the ground

41
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,100
All your men always laugh

42
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,100
All your men always laugh

43
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,100
All owns a safe mind

44
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,100
And put it on your mouth on the ground

45
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:14,100
Oh man, that's a rock and roll song.

46
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,100
The genders and commemorate glands.

47
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,100
I played the genders before on Charlie.

48
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,100
And wasn't till this time that I found this new song that put up

49
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,100
a lot of music network.

50
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,100
I realized they're from Israel.

51
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:33,100
And if you listen to the lyrics, there's kind of some giveaways in that song.

52
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,100
I love that song.

53
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,100
Everybody how you're doing coming to you from Northern California.

54
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,100
A very stunning San Francisco today.

55
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:46,100
As I come close to the end of my trip.

56
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,100
And it's this is really weird.

57
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,100
It's Thursday morning.

58
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,100
And I'm doing the show here.

59
00:05:51,100 --> 00:06:00,100
And this is a really strange day because at 7 a.m., US versus Ghana started on television.

60
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,100
It's very hard because I really want to see the US play.

61
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,100
But I also need to do the show at the same time to hit the satellite window.

62
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,100
And it's already kind of depressing because Ghana's how mandate they had a great goal.

63
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,100
They just took the ball right away from our team cap and shot it right in.

64
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:22,100
I'm trying not to look at the screen over and over in the corner of the condo here.

65
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,100
And just get through the show.

66
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,100
And by the way, welcome to the show.

67
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,100
It is the show.

68
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,100
The show.

69
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,100
You're part of the show.

70
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,100
We're all in the show.

71
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,100
Are you in the show yet?

72
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,100
And what's the deal with this soccer versus football yesterday?

73
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,100
I had a caller calling on the voicemail line.

74
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,100
It was just it was a listener from Germany.

75
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,100
But the quality was so bad.

76
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,100
I luckily, a whole bunch of other people picked up on it and sent in the actual history

77
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,100
and the origin of the word soccer.

78
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,100
And why does used versus the world standard of football.

79
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,100
Hey Adam, it's Dave.

80
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,100
The guy who left you that.

81
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,100
Whoo!

82
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,100
Whoo!

83
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,100
Mess is on your answering machine.

84
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,100
You didn't get it.

85
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,100
That was a hockey reference.

86
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,100
You just hockey reference?

87
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
Hmmm.

88
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,100
Okay, sorry, didn't get it.

89
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,100
Not a big hockey fan.

90
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,100
That on Wednesday's Charlie.

91
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,700
I think it was the only person in America interested in hockey

92
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:20,980
What went wrong there? How can we don't care about hockey in the US? Hey, there's one place in America that still cares about hockey Northcare

93
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,980
No, what was that don't stop? Hey Adam it's Dave the guy who left you that

94
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,980
Woo woo

95
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:34,740
Messages on your answering machine. You didn't get it. It was a hockey reference. You said on Wednesday's charlie

96
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:40,580
I think it was the only person in America interested now. Man this sucks. I only loaded half the file. Oh shoot

97
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,460
Oh

98
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,460
Maybe I have maybe I have another version of it

99
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,340
Maybe this one. Maybe this is it. Let's see

100
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:04,220
Oh man. This is all going wrong. See now that the US is losing my my production is all screwed up whole on a second

101
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:12,500
Of course I could start the whole show over and get back to that, but let me try this hold on because I know the guy from Germany called in again

102
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,020
Let's see. Let's see if we can find it. I don't know

103
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:22,020
Oh, man. Oh, this is so horrible. This is so not what I wanted

104
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,220
I okay, wait a minute if I plug this

105
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:34,180
You're witnessing a complete meltdown here on the daily source code. Okay. I'm now pulling stuff out of the archives

106
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,340
Let's see if this works

107
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:42,980
Hey Adam, this is Brad Gunther from Berlin. Oh, there we go. You start playing a common I sent in on for a wait and

108
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,740
stopped because it's sound horrible and

109
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:54,100
I'm trying now a slightly different setup. I'm going to try sending you a succumb instead of through Skype and see if that helps at all

110
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:00,660
I was talking about the difference between football and soccer and how the words were used differently and and where they developed

111
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,620
I read this in a germ magazine article recently

112
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:10,980
Basically it said that in the 1870s when rugby was first dying become really popular in

113
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:19,460
Britain the decision was made between the players who earned favor of of football to continue

114
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:24,260
Call that soccer as a differentiating is a differentiating themselves from people who were in favor of rugby

115
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,180
So the game two types of football rugby football and soccer football

116
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:35,300
And actually then few years later when the first time a college championship game was held in the US for football

117
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,100
One of the teams showed up having played soccer and the other team showed up having played rugby

118
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,300
And over the course next year to the US teams kind of came up with a hybrid which we know today is as football in the US

119
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,020
in order to kind of make up for

120
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,420
That's different so

121
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,460
Officially football is right when you're talking about any sport if that's sort whether it's

122
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,580
soccer rugby American football

123
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,820
Canadian football arena football whatever falls into that rough category of having developed in the same place

124
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,580
And soccer is just a way to specify which brand of that you're playing

125
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,220
All right, well, thanks for playing this and take care

126
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,180
All right, so sorry about that

127
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,220
Okay, so the other comment from the the hockey guy was very similar

128
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,140
Only I liked his woohoo with the beginning let's hear that again

129
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,860
Oh, that's a good

130
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,860
Here we go hey Adam

131
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,700
Shoot everything's all messed up

132
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,700
Pay no attention to the guy who's doing a show but really watching television

133
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,700
This is where I get all messed up

134
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,060
Yeah, so so what it sounds like to me is that the word was football in 1870 or whatever

135
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,620
And because of

136
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,780
Issues here in the US we changed it to soccer. I still don't understand what the real root of the word soccer is you know

137
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,220
Who came up with that how do you go from football to soccer regardless it's pretty clear

138
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,100
The origin is of course football and so we're gonna leave it at football and when we talk about American football

139
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:12,340
We'll say just that day six of the Unleashbeard not everybody real happy about it Patricia is not digging this at all

140
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:18,820
So and I knew this was gonna happen so I guess this this is what it's supposed to be it's supposed to be a little bit painful

141
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,500
The longer it takes for us to unleash pod show plus in the podcast delivery network the more pain I get at home

142
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,860
So it's my personal suffering. It's not like anyone a pod show HQ cares

143
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,900
Some of the some people hate my beard there too, by the way, so of course if you look at the

144
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,180
Picture art that I've put into the MP3 file for today if you're looking on an MP3 player

145
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,820
They can display that you know iTunes or your iPod would also

146
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,260
Many other versions of the MP3 players do it

147
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:53,140
Including pod show plus you'll see that it is indeed growing and that idea to do that to put that into the

148
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,900
MP3 album art

149
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,900
Yes, I couldn't I couldn't remember who would told me to do that and boy that I get spanked

150
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,260
Who there was Brittany of course my second life sexy girlfriend

151
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,780
She'll never let me live that one down

152
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:14,580
So yeah, he's getting there and people are suggesting stuff. You know, he's just put cream in it to stop the etching and I don't know

153
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,180
I just want to have a little bit of pain. It makes me feel a part of the whole process

154
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,220
Thank you all very much also for trying to help me out with the

155
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,100
Windows equivalent of the hide command

156
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,900
This is something I'm still missing severely

157
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:34,260
You know, it's really cool on on a Mac on on OS 10 if you want to hide an application

158
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:40,900
You just and this is what and I forgot to mention this yesterday. It's all a left-hand movement because you know my right hand is is doing other things

159
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,140
It's touching my mouse

160
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,900
So with my left hand, I can use apple key H which is real easy

161
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:53,060
Real even from a right hand because H is pretty much in the middle of the keyboard and the apple key is on both sides

162
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,100
So very handy to just hide one application

163
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,860
so people sent me plenty of

164
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,860
Plenty of feedback saying hey, you know if you hold down the window start key and M it'll

165
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:09,140
Minimize or if you hold down the window start key and D it'll minimize two problems with that

166
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:15,460
The first is actually a problem with this particular keyboard that is in the to achieve a portage

167
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,140
For some reason they put the windows start key top right so it's

168
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,140
Yeah, the F12 then I've got the print screen and then I have the windows key

169
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,340
So not only is it on the right which of course is my mouse touching hand

170
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,540
I just don't like removing my hand from my mouse

171
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
So you really need

172
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:41,380
Yeah, you can do it with left but then it becomes kind of tough and the same course goes for any combination

173
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,900
Then includes the windows key

174
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:50,020
But also that doesn't hide just the top application it really hides minimizes everything hides minimize the same thing I guess

175
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,980
And and it and it

176
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,260
It takes you to your desktop. I just want to be able to hide one application

177
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:01,300
Because then I can always switch back with the quick all tab which of course does work very well

178
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,300
And that's the same on Mac as on Windows

179
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:10,100
So still looking for to be able to minimize the top most application with one swift key command

180
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,340
Preferably that would be a key command with a left hand

181
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,340
Score oh it's one one. Okay

182
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:24,900
While I was talking about touching my mouse. There you go. It's one one fantastic. Oh man in the 43rd minute

183
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,980
Good so I'll feel good as we go on to halftime and then we can just complete this show

184
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,300
Something funny happened at the office yesterday actually it happened a couple days ago

185
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,660
But I didn't really find out about until just the other day now

186
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:45,700
We're using Bank of America at Pod Show and this is kind of a legacy thing because when Ron and I started the company and we were funding it ourselves

187
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,020
I was very easy

188
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,740
Particularly because we were pretty much based in Miami at the time at least the finances were based in Miami

189
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,620
And we had Bank of America

190
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,700
I got to tell you American banks really suck

191
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,340
ass

192
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,900
And I'll and I'm gonna give you the only example that I have and there are many many more

193
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:14,740
But I've dealt with all kinds of banks around the world and I have banks around the world and I really think European banks are far superior

194
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,180
Now's have a private bank which gives you all kinds of personal service and a very cute blonde banker

195
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,140
She's a woman by the way

196
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,620
But that's neither here nor the hair. The real issue is credit cards and

197
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
You know, I've had a

198
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:36,100
Mastercard through my bank in the Netherlands for six years and

199
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:43,100
Never no matter where I was in the world no matter what the price was of the item

200
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,420
I was purchasing or whatever I was paying for or what type of it was on the internet or or hotel

201
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
If it was in Asia if it was in

202
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:57,060
I've used it everywhere but South America I think never have it has it been declined and and I'm not saying

203
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:07,140
That's because of course I have enough money in the bank, but it's never been declined for any of the numerous reasons that I continuously get declined for

204
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,620
on my US visa card

205
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:15,620
And it drives me absolutely batch it because there's plenty of money to cover the account

206
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,180
But they have all these triggers and trips and of course, you know, I'm all over the place

207
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,820
You know, so one day I'm buying so I'm getting money from an ATM in San Francisco next day

208
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,860
I'm buying Virgin Atlantic tickets and I'm doing that from the UK

209
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:33,780
I might be at an ATM in in the Netherlands or or getting fuel at Rotterdam Airport

210
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,660
Continuously this triggers all kinds of alarms and then they declined the world that yeah

211
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,660
They did they declined the card with the police call us and then I got to get on the phone and

212
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:48,820
It's tedious embarrassing and it's freaking lame and it's not like we don't move millions of dollars through this account

213
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,380
and you know and we we and Cindy bless her heart Cindy who

214
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:59,380
Really isn't you know like a like a like a financial controller position at Pod show

215
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,820
She manages all this she has to call the bank all the time and and it you know

216
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,660
She'll get a call from me on Sunday saying Cindy. I got it. I got to pay for these tickets

217
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:12,180
You know, I don't because it just it's so much more effort if than I use my card and then as a reimbursement

218
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,100
It goes back and forth. It's a pain in the ass. It's a real pain and

219
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:22,260
That's what the corporate credit card. So I'd also ask Cindy who was kind enough to

220
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,900
Set me up. I needed a bank account. He just a private account here in the US. I just wanted checking account

221
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,100
So of course, you know, you've got me the the company line. She got me bank of America

222
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,580
That's fine. I just needed to checking account just to build a pay for some like the calm cast bill and some you know some

223
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,420
Some basic stuff. I mean I do have a household here at the condo

224
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,420
And and so that arrived and of course

225
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,300
I had been gone for a while so I didn't have time to activate the credit card that came with the account

226
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,060
So

227
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,820
So

228
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:58,580
So I get the credit card. By the way, this this whole declination of stuff it happens to I mean I was

229
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:04,260
Having dinner with one of our investors with rom shirom in London the guy is a billionaire

230
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:10,420
And he was one of the he was an angel investor in Google so it's not about him having enough money

231
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:16,340
We're having dinner in London just the two of us and he picks up the tab which was nice and

232
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:21,780
It's card gets declined and it's and it's and it's not because of his money is because you know

233
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,380
Oh my gosh the card all of sudden is traveled to the UK. I'm sorry

234
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,540
I get really worked up about this because

235
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,300
All this crap about it's for your protection bullshit. It's not for my protection

236
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,660
It's for your protection bank of America and it's really pissing me off

237
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,340
Anyway, okay, so

238
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,300
So I had the credit card and you have to activate it. So I call the number on the card and it says oh we can't the card

239
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,820
You're trying to activate cannot be found. Okay. I tried again. I tried again

240
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,780
So uh say Cindy could you just check it out and find out for me? You know whenever you have time

241
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,380
It's my personal card don't worry about it. I have other ones to use and

242
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,100
And so she gives it back to me you know like a day later

243
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,700
It's okay. It had to be yet to call from a specific phone number because that's how they verify and cross-reference the records

244
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:14,820
So I call and of course the credit card you're trying to activate cannot be found. So I go back to Cindy and I say okay

245
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,500
Look you know whatever just you know let me know when you can figure it out these guys are host

246
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,580
So two or three days ago buying I'm like I wonder and you know as and I say

247
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,180
Hey, Cindy you have my no actually asked Rosie if she had my credit card

248
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,820
She had no no Cindy still has it and then Cindy said that you know she didn't know if she had it and

249
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:36,180
Well, I got a beautiful email from Cindy the other day where she copped to what it actually happened

250
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,900
It seems uh it was a small accident

251
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,220
She accidentally shredded my credit card

252
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,940
What not what you're how it happened

253
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:56,420
But it went through the actual shredder and it's in pieces. We're just probably better

254
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,460
Craft credit cards

255
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,500
Stupid in England. It's great and we have Barclays bank

256
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,020
I don't know I said don't give me I don't want a credit card. I'll just take a debit card

257
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,580
It's much easier all they do is check that it was for some reason with debit cards

258
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,620
There's there's no declination of of your charge

259
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,420
They just look at the actual amount if you have enough money. Okay. That's fine

260
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,460
And there is there is a limit that you can go over

261
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:24,100
In spending because in theory, of course, you know someone if they have your card could take all your money out

262
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,740
So there there is a limit there, but it always works

263
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,380
Crazy

264
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:34,660
It drives me nuts. It's for your protection and people actually believe that shit smart people

265
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:40,260
You know, it's a well, you know, it is important that they chase you at the check on that because it is for your protection bullshit

266
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,300
You're insured so one can steal your card can can can spend a hundred thousand dollars

267
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,540
You're not going to be liable for it at least not with any of the credit cards I've had

268
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,860
But just as continuous it's supposed to be easy. It's not easy

269
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:59,140
And of course, you know people say well, why don't you try American Express? Well, that is not as it is not accepted everywhere

270
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,340
Not every airline will accept it get it together people

271
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:08,180
And thank you Cindy for helping me out. I know you I know you didn't do from purpose. I know you'll get me a new one

272
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,940
We met with

273
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,940
We met with some dudes from Nokia

274
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,780
Came over. I know comic strip bloggers going to be real happy to hear that

275
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,100
Excuse me, nice company

276
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,580
We met with some guys from Nokia and they're doing some pretty interesting stuff. They they're now listing

277
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:31,780
Podcast Ali and pod show picks in in there they have a podcast application in their new phones

278
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,380
Which actually works

279
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,500
It's pretty cool. They have a little aggregator and you can

280
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:45,060
It's nice that they have these lists because you can basically just go in and and twoodle around and find stuff click subscribe

281
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,460
And it and it functions exactly the way you'd want to

282
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,860
And so they they sent me a phone of course wanting me to talk about it

283
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,900
It's the n91

284
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,900
A phone that I would never use for one simple reason

285
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,860
It's it has a regular

286
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,420
numeric keypad

287
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,940
So you know I use my my blackberry which of course is the phone

288
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:16,180
That I use but it's also my email device and what I do miss on that of course is all kinds of multimedia which doesn't have so this said this n91

289
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,420
has

290
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,660
Has the smallest keys in the world which are hidden by a slide out cover

291
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:29,300
But what I wanted to share with you today and this is the real bummer is the and I said this n91

292
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,300
It's a it's a real

293
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,300
Music powerhouse. I guess

294
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,340
It has four a four gig drive

295
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,900
Built in four gigabytes of space and

296
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,340
The quality of the sound is so good

297
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
That they actually supply you with a cable

298
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,660
That has a mini headphone jack that goes into the into the phone and then it has two RCA plugs

299
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:58,100
So you can plug it into your stereo system and the sound is phenomenal has a and then the built-in speaker is fantastic and it has a 1.3

300
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:02,020
No, I'm sorry has a two megapixel camera so all that's really cool. It has

301
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,700
Check this out it has Wi-Fi built in which I was really digging

302
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,220
And it has a and the browser is nice

303
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,820
So they had loaded it up with a whole bunch of songs

304
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,860
And this is the scary thing so

305
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:22,500
And then not just songs but they had ringtones and they had really funny ones and they had one like like a hip hop ringtone for me

306
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,020
Like Adam Curry and your phone is ringing and then they had a

307
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,300
That of course they had the Roger Smalls ringtone and I don't know if they're pre-packaging on those on all Nokia

308
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,340
N91 phones, but they were kind enough to put it in the one they gave to me

309
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:42,260
And so and I was like, yeah, this is great. I'm gonna play it on the show tomorrow and and so I put it in my bag

310
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:50,660
After I'd actually played with these with these files with these ringtones which are just I guess MP3s or AAC whatever they are

311
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,300
There's some kind of format doesn't matter. It's a ringtone and

312
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,300
And now I boot it up. I turn the phone on

313
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,700
And I go to the music and it's like no song so whole things empty

314
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,180
So it's like what happened?

315
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:10,580
You know, I look I know I didn't delete the entire library of songs something must have gone wrong so

316
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,460
Unfortunately, I can't I can't give you a demo

317
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:22,580
And quite honestly if if if there's a phone that is going to lose all my shit

318
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,660
I'm not that interested in it. So

319
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:30,020
Well, maybe the guys from Nokia can figure out what happened or let me know maybe I'm looking in the wrong spot

320
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:36,980
But I literally see if I press on if I go to the music area. I see was it say no songs right no songs

321
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,980
So there's just no freaking songs crap

322
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,580
Right

323
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,940
So

324
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:48,580
When you think of Nokia you have to think of comic strip blogger who has his own problems

325
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:07,700
I just wanted to apologize to all Welsh people if I have offended you in my latest audio comment

326
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:14,740
So please accept my apology and here let's learn another phrase in Welsh

327
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,620
Siddhartha here Siddhartha here. What means how are you?

328
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,100
Siddhartha here and now the phrase

329
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,900
Very well. Thank you very much

330
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,460
That young Diochen Vauhr

331
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:34,260
The young Diochen Vauhr and finally goodbyes in Welsh

332
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,300
Holy Vauhr

333
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,500
Holy Vauhr

334
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,700
Holy Vauhr

335
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:43,940
So I would like to say once again apology to Welsh people and I really admire that

336
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,980
Welsh people have been able to preserve their original Celtic language

337
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,420
As the only ethnic group in United Kingdom

338
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:58,900
Fulva Adam Kerry yeah, you can suck up all you want csb but I don't know people are buying it

339
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,580
He made some derogatory comment about Welsh folks yesterday

340
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:07,940
You know the other day before on the show and it became a heated debate of course once again on curry.com

341
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,260
Gosh this was a pretty frightening

342
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:21,460
Link that I received from Merrill about how dangers it really can be to

343
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,940
Follow sleep with your laptop on your lap

344
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,260
Sent a link which of course will be in the show notes a daily source code dot com

345
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:35,060
Let me just open this up for a second. There was a conference

346
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:40,740
And I'm thinking this was this conference in Japan hold on it's a web page from the inquire

347
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,300
Yeah, Japanese conference

348
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,660
So

349
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,660
So they have pictures of what happened

350
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,740
This guy had a Dell laptop and all of a sudden the thing explodes

351
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:56,740
I mean not just I mean like really explain pictures of this explosion and flames coming out of this thing

352
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,140
Apparently was it was a bad battery

353
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:04,420
You know one of these they say oh is an OEM battery or something you know some some replacement battery or whatever

354
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:11,140
Or not an original battery, but man they needed fire extinguishers to put the guys laptop out and I'm thinking to myself

355
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,660
You know we go through all this rigour morale at the airport

356
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:20,580
You know taking your shoes off and and taking your belt off and letting the you know letting the guy

357
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:28,580
Feel your nuts with the back of his hand and we got to take our lighters out and we can't carry those and you know I can't bring my weed

358
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,860
But the laptop is a bomb it's an explosive device

359
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:41,060
And you know if this happens with a Dell dude, it's a Dell it could happen with with any machine

360
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,820
You got to see those pictures it it'll frighten you

361
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:50,100
Yeah, and you know what I guarantee you before too long

362
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:56,660
Someone will say oh, we can't have any laptops on the plane because you know they could explode and terrorists could be using that shit

363
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,860
Just goes to show it's just to keep you happy and feeling safe

364
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,980
You know I have this this skin on

365
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,780
Well, I guess it's called a skin on my

366
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,100
On my windows layout which makes the look kind of like a Mac and

367
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:18,180
Because of that it changes all the window colors and for some reason now when cast blaster has a built in timer

368
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:24,980
And 30 seconds before the end of the timer, which I've said at 24 minutes and 30 seconds, which is when the satellite window closes

369
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,700
It starts flashing the window

370
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:34,180
But for some reason with this new layout the flashing it doesn't catch my eye and guess what I missed the satellite window

371
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:40,900
In fact, I've missed it by about five minutes, so I apologize to Uncle Jesse Pete dub the satellite repairman for missing that and

372
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,700
Let's get back to some comments

373
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,060

The message of earthlink and to those people who look at my email problems and say oh, you're not using earthlink

394
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,460

395
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,500

400
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,500
Yesterday Chris McIntyre

401
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:04,500
Podcast Valley the Prince of Podcast Valley came over. No, I mean, it's like

402
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,060
You know we're across the room and

403
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,900
He received the letter from Ask Cap from the new media department which is pretty interesting

404
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:17,060
And I just wanted to share a little bit of this with you because I think it means something

405
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,340
Pretty important. Do you miss the McIntyre

406
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:25,700
Congratulations on having joined the growing number of internet sites which use music as an element of their programming

407
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:31,380
You may not have considered however that under the United States copyright law the public performance of copyrighted

408
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:36,020
Music requires permission from the copyright owners or their licensing representative such as Ask Cap

409
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:43,940
Musical performances present presented by means of internet transmissions are public performances because they are steps in the process by which the music wins

410
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,660
wind

411
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,660
word is that

412
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:54,180
Because it is what is it because they are steps in the process by which the music wins

413
00:31:54,980 --> 00:32:01,220
It's way to the end users who are its intended audience. Look at this listen the arrogance of that sentence

414
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,580
Yeah, you music lovers you're not music lovers

415
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,180
You are end users who are an intended audience

416
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,420
According to Ask Cap

417
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:15,140
Now of course we'd ask Cap are pleased to offer you our new license agreement by which you will be able to

418
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:21,140
Loughly perform all the music in Ask Cap's vast Repetory by means of your internet site transmissions and

419
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,140
Closes your copy of that agreement

420
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,500
Blody Blody Blody Blody Blody Blody Blody Blot a couple things they don't to mention is

421
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:33,620
You need the actual permission of the owner of the work itself not just for the performance, but for the

422
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,820
download and sync right so it's very very misleading

423
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,180
and

424
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,900
Then they go into some it's just an amazing

425
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:49,460
I've seen lots of contracts and lots of agreements in my life, but I'm confused by all of page two

426
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,580
But anyway the minimum annual license fee payable on the Ask Cap agreement is $288

427
00:32:54,580 --> 00:33:01,460
And amount chosen so that the cost of the Ask Cap license is well within the reach of even the smallest site operators hey speak for your self-ask app

428
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,620
And here's the best part

429
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,900
So they go through this in order to enter to the new Ask Cap agreement please complete paragraph

430
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,940
1-3 and 5 in the first page sign the agreement in the space provided on page five

431
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,820
Compliment sign the rate schedule report form of your choice and return them all to me

432
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,940
We will counter sign return only one fully executed copy the agreement to you for your files

433
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:22,820
It is not necessary to send any money at this time. We will bill you on a quarterly basis

434
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,060
So

435
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,060
First of all, I think it's misleading

436
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,540
Because they it gives you the idea

437
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,140
That you can actually play all these songs which is not true

438
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:39,940
I just categorically not true because there is a dispute over whether there is a performance or is it a

439
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:48,420
A download and believe me, you know, if you're paying for if you're paying Ask Cap and you play any one of their songs the RIA

440
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,260
Can and probably will come after you'll ask about that

441
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,580
So thank you very much Ask Cap, but we're we're quite happy with

442
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:04,100
The pod safe music network because they're the artists grant all the licenses and there's no money changing hands except when

443
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,940
listeners

444
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,940
fans music lovers

445
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:14,740
not users as you state when they love it and want to support the artist and then they go and give them some money

446
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:19,060
99 cents if they do it to the pod safe music network, but they might buy the t-shirts they might go to

447
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:25,700
Go to their concerts the buy other swag. I think we've got a system that is routing around

448
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,580
These have truths that you were spreading

449
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:32,740
But the fact that this letter went out my foot my friends is very clear

450
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:39,940
It means that lawsuits are soon to follow so if you're podcasting please please please be very careful

451
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,940
What you're doing

452
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,940
I guess it's only really one song we can play

453
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,580
Top of the world

454
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:07,540
You probably walking down the street with your earbuds champs so deep in your ear

455
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:13,140
Yeah, you go and damn you probably found this little mp3 for free

456
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:24,180
We're looking play this but not on the radio made this just so I could let it go

457
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:30,500
Does anyone around here? Still have a radio and anyone here at all?

458
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,020
Anyone here at all?

459
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,820
You should go and see a mountain kubernetes

460
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,780
No, it's way cooler out there

461
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:55,540
Yeah, I think so, but maybe you just like it in your cozy little world

462
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:06,420
We can play this but not on the radio made this just so I could let it go

463
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:12,660
Does anyone around here? Still have a radio and anyone here at all?

464
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,340
Anyone here at

465
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:22,740
Maybe I'm just literally what you say

466
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,540
Leave a front of my head

467
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:33,300
Maybe I just like it if you turn it off now turn it off now

468
00:36:46,340 --> 00:37:10,340
Don't forget about a sound reeling West Virginia we can make it on our own

469
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:16,180
Do it just fine, I can't afford your record, but it's outside

470
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:27,220
We can play this but not on the radio and make this but not fall the radio

471
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:31,540
Hey now switch off your radio

472
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:42,420
You can play this but not on the radio made this just so I could let it go

473
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:48,660
Does anyone around here? Still have a radio and anyone here at all?

474
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,420
Anyone here at all?

475
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,260
Anyone here at all?

476
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:07,460
The Jeff Smith latest in gentlemen not on the radio that's right you can play these songs anywhere not on the radio

477
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:15,700
You could find Jeff Smith at the Jeff Smith dot taunt dot com Jeff is G E O F of course links in the show notes depressing news

478
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,700
It is now two to one for Ghana, so I guess I just got to end this show

479
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,460
Oh, by the way for those of you who've been wondering what I've been doing in second life

480
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:31,700
Not a lot for the past two weeks because well, you know been out here and the time is all different and I really just don't have because I'm basically doing the show in the morning

481
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:40,420
And in the cottage when I get up in the morning and I've done the show then I still have time before San Francisco is actually awake to to mess around

482
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,420
And

483
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,300
We got some pretty exciting news. I'll talk about that tomorrow a little more in detail, but we've basically started a

484
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:52,340
New community the founding members of this community myself Brittany

485
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:59,860
ex-dark ex-alora magic star names you probably recognize if you've hung out in second life and come around to the castle

486
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,940
I've learned an incredible amount about how this game works

487
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,660
Because I do have to say

488
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,140
Having been in second life for a while

489
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:16,180
All the promise of you know how can crossover into real life and I was very interested in the financial aspect of it

490
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,500
You know, it's a game. It's totally a game because they've they've got it all messed up with

491
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,620
with

492
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,620
exchange rates and inflation and

493
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,740
Yeah, it's it

494
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:34,180
I have to say remains a game. However, it still has an interface that is some very very powerful

495
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:41,380
Asmodio that will take us to eventually a new paradigm of computing and the way we share files and the way we share

496
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,780
Information online. I'm convinced of that

497
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:49,140
But there's a lot of downside to what's going on in there and also I did I understand correctly

498
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:54,580
That there no longer going to require a credit card or PayPal when you sign up

499
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:01,940
I think this is a huge mistake because what I like so much about second life is one thing you knew for sure

500
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,460
Pretty much everybody in there is an adult because

501
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:10,420
You know not only had to you have to give your age and you have to be over 18 I guess or 17

502
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,740
But you also have to have a credit card

503
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:19,300
Which I thought was a real nice, you know factor and I believe that they've taken that requirement out so now and you know any

504
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:25,060
13 year old can go in and lie about the rage and still sign up and sure they may not have any

505
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:29,620
Any linden dollars to work with but guess how they're going to go get their linden dollars

506
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,900
Well if you've been in second life, then you know how a lot of people make money there

507
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,780
So

508
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,420
Here's all I'm going to say I bought an island

509
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,820
Okay, and

510
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:47,060
These founding founding members were we're trying to do something different and you'll be invited you can come in and you can join too

511
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,020
And I think it's going to be a lot of fun

512
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:55,940
You know a little more laid back a little more relaxed a little less hassle because now

513
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,140
We really control a lot more of where goes on on the land

514
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:05,620
Because you know the entire island is ours so more about that on the tomorrow show

515
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:09,620
Loved to hear from you. We got our voicemail feedback lines wide open

516
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:14,180
We've got a new jersey number which is probably the best if you're going to use Skype

517
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,980
20116256357 or any UK number in London

518
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,180
O2076813753

519
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,700
Still to one

520
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:30,580
So maybe they can pick that up by the time you hear this you'll know the final the final score and yeah

521
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:35,380
Hopefully USA will do good. I really really and I mean I know people who are actually

522
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:42,740
At bars who went to the bar this morning at six a.m. to be ready for the seven seven to clock game and are already

523
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:48,900
You know cheering our team. This is unheard of in world cup football unheard of that this happens in the U.S

524
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:54,020
So by the next time which will be in four years from now although I have to say

525
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,820
There's a lot of talk about doing it every two years

526
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:02,340
I think U.S will be a real true contender and they've done fantastic so far and I'm really proud of the boys

527
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,460
Yesterday, of course, I watched the Netherlands against Argentina

528
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,620
Went next door to

529
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,340
21st Amendment with Richard Brewer hey who's

530
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:17,060
He's a young he's an officially a young but you know he's kind of a UK boy

531
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,140
And that was a tough game. It was tough to watch it was a draw as you probably know

532
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:29,940
But I guess now the Netherlands plays Portugal which they were not looking forward to no one wants to play Portugal
