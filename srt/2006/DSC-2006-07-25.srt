00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,320
It's just when you get up

92
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,760
Uh, sorry about that when you get up early every morning and

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,440
You do a show and it's just you know, you I don't know my brain works pretty well in the morning and I'm just like

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
so tired of hearing about this

95
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,760
Okay, so let's try and be positive today good news looks like the weather broke

96
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,160
Remember yesterday I was telling you about the convection fog because it was rolling in over the hills

97
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:12,760
Of course, I'm right kind of in the middle between the them hills over there yonder and the bay and so you get the warm air and the cool air coming together

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,760
You get a whole bunch of fog that was the first clue that was going to start chilling out just a little bit

99
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,560
Yesterday when I walked home where last night I should say around

100
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,040
Actually we were there quite late about eight thirty or something like that before we left

101
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,160
It was me

102
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,160
Mark Steven and Bridget and

103
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,240
It was it was chilly it was actually like oh, this is so nice

104
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,840
I still didn't have to put my jacket on but it was it was really it was

105
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Quite enjoyable San Francisco

106
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,600
Although you think California it's always really it is nice it usually is just nice and sunny here

107
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,960
But it's cool, you know, it's between 70 and 75 degrees it's pretty much a year round sometimes a little bit chillier

108
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,080
And most homes aren't equipped for for really warm weather and we've been having

109
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,560
High in the 90s

110
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,760
Right outside of San Francisco in the valley. It's been triple digits. It's been extremely warm

111
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,440
You know, there's nothing really to this global warming though. Do you think you know

112
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,200
Nothing has anything to do with it. I mean it couldn't possibly be now cut it

113
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,320
Hey

114
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,360
In the 80s I would have done anything to show you my magic garden

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,200
Put now what wait a minute to show me what

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,840
You let me just roll that back to show me you're magic. What

117
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,320
What I would have done anything to show you my magic garden

118
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,200
I don't know what you said you're magic anything but I still am interested in seeing it now

119
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:47,720
You can hear all about it in our podcast the outer order show. It's a really fun show where we talk about everything and nothing all at once

125
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:20,360
Speaking of being old and and last you know, it was funny last night Brigid who works at pod show HQ

126
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,040
She works with the marketing Steven

127
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:28,360
I think she's about 10 years younger than I am and and and she's a it was a huge a grand grand fan

128
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:34,280
And so she was asking me questions and of course I have stories about just I mean almost every single 80s

129
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:41,160
Artists even some 90s artists you can think of and I was like, okay, just give me another name and I'll tell you a story

130
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,760
So new segment here on the daily source code

131
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,880
Tell me about your favorite 80s or 90s band if I had sex with him or if I did anything else

132
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,480
It was interesting. I'll tell you the story because I do have a lot of stories and before I get too old and can't remember

133
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:03,320
That shit anymore. Maybe be nice to just to lay it down, you know, and and get it out there have a recorded history of of my life. It would be nice

134
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
I started

135
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,320
the Troy needs an iPod

136
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,720
Go daddy contest on the daily source code last week and I and I realized I made a slight mistake

137
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,480
So the whole idea was Troy needs an iPod.com

138
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,080
This is Troy who's been trying to race funds to get an iPod and then someone else came in with

139
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,800
Something like I think was I need an iPod more than Troy dot com and I said well

140
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,160
Well, here's a great idea for your go daddy contest now it only costs $6.95 to enter and it's not an official contest

141
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,640
There are no rules and I determine the ultimate winner

142
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,120
Avoid wherever he would buy a law yada yada yada

143
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,920
I said why don't you register a cool domain name and the most original and I think it's not just the domain name

144
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,440
But perhaps the domain that it points to that's something else to consider

145
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,920
We'll win a video iPod

146
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,880
And so what happened is people are emailing this to me. I've tremendous email problems

147
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,440
Which I'll tell you about in a second so I'm not getting all entries. So what I suggest is

148
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:08,840
Everyone who also because I have received about 10 entries so everyone who's received an entry instead of emailing it

149
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,880
Everyone who is sent in instead instead of emailing it to me

150
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,440
Go to daily source code dot com and then place a comment there

151
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,640
Underneath today's episode so that we have a nice, you know running list of

152
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,040
Of all of the all of the entries. That's awesome pretty funny ones and of course if you

153
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,560
Register the domain at godaddy dot com and use the checkout code dsc3

154
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,600
You'll get that domain name for $6.95

155
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,520
So and and I am for real about the video iPod and I have no idea how long we're gonna keep the the promotion running

156
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,280
At least until the end of this week and maybe next week so go ahead and and do something

157
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:55,640
So the it's start off with Troy needs an iPod dot com Troy. You're still eligible by the way you could come up with a new one so come up with an awesome

158
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,280
Domain name again. I think extra points for which

159
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:07,560
Website of which domain you're pointing it to and just leave that as a comment under today's episode at daily source code dot com

160
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,760
Hi, Adam. It's Brian from audioattitude dot com and

161
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,400
This is about this big contest about getting an iPod if you come up with a clever

162
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,640
Domain name right? I

163
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:27,080
Figure it out could be as good as Troy with my experience at picking domain names being so successful at that you remember

164
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:37,480
Progress to cast in fact I think some folks over at that what is it raspberry dot com you know the show without the vowls or the site without the vowls

165
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,920
I think they got that idea for me, you know procrasticast raspberry without vowls

166
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,040
Anyway, so I went on over to go daddy and spent some time this weekend

167
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,080
picking out some names and I started out with iPod for pod show dot com

168
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:00,520
Kind of bland and plus it's pod show plus right so iPod for a pod show plus dot com was my next purchase

169
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,280
But then I that well, so what does that have to do with anything and then I then I got iPod show plus

170
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,200
Just simply that at that's boring. It doesn't say anything about needing an iPod

171
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:19,240
So then I put I need iPod for pod show dot com and I thought well

172
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,320
Okay, I'm this sucks really

173
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,800
I bought four domain names and and it all sucks

174
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:35,800
And I thought well it sucks that's that reminds me of of your blog on July 8 from DSC 417

175
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,800
When you were helping some of us who pod cast with our our feed sucking number

176
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:49,560
And you help this through that and and after that I I sort of in my typical sarcastic way

177
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,080
Asked if there was a way for pod show to come clean my house

178
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,600
Since it was so good at sucking feeds it could suck some dirt out of my house whatever and you said well

179
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,200
You know what if you get a thousand listeners to your show on pod show

180
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,400
You'll come clean my house yourself

181
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,480
I thought okay

182
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,440
That's that's great why not and

183
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,880
So I just want to tell you that I've already got five listeners on pod show and

184
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,520
And actually that's that's going to take about 16 years at that rate and I don't know if you're going to really have the time

185
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,840
In 16 years to come clean my house and I'm not sure I want to wait that long

186
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,520
And so I just wanted to give you this option that if I win the iPod

187
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,120
You know the the deals off and you don't have to worry about coming to clean my house in 16 years

188
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,520
So I thought that'd be really cool and

189
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,120
So I got this domain name at go daddy

190
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,520
I went an iPod and Adam doesn't suck dot com in other words

191
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,360
I win the iPod you don't have to come over here and and suck up all the dirt right

192
00:13:53,160 --> 00:14:00,840
Cool I went an iPod and Adam doesn't suck dot com I thought about I went an iPod and Adam doesn't suck dot or a G because I like or Gs

193
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:07,800
But it's so giving you know, but I thought well, it's too difficult to remember for people and those

194
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,120
Orgies are are difficult to to think about sometimes

195
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,880
So I decided to stick with this I went an iPod and Adam doesn't suck dot com

196
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,480
What do you think about that well either way Adam?

197
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,480
I'm I'm going to start cleaning so

198
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,120
Thanks for the consideration

199
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,920
I went an iPod and Adam doesn't suck dot com

200
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,760
Emma right on

201
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,920
All right definitely good entry going posted over at the daily source code dot com

202
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:45,480
Yeah, I love to orgies myself or Gs a good a mind wants asked for a role of toilet paper

203
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,000
I had some extra so I gladly gave

204
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:55,960
And then much to my surprise the fellow looked me in the eyes and asked me should I fold it

205
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,520
Or scrunch it in a ball and I promptly and most certainly said

206
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:07,400
If you scrunch it or fold it I don't really want to know it what works for you is not for me to know

207
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,840
A fellow needs some air when dealing down there so let me leave you be in your commode

208
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:22,200
If you fold it or scrunch it I have a sinking hunch that it would do the bloody job well either way

209
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:29,560
For I know it's not my place. I'd never rub it in his face all the private details of my toiletry

210
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:37,240
But at least I'm glad to think we don't do it in the sink in short that may well lead to anarchy

211
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So scrunch it or fold it

212
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,080
Everybody knows that it will do the bloody job well either way

213
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,880
So don't spend your honest wage on some fancy old the day

214
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,560
You know where it will end so use it well my friend

215
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,360
Scrunch and fold it anyway. You please

216
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,000
There's no reason for playing that other than I just wanted to play it one more time yesterday posted a picture on

217
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,120
I'm Craig dot com with my set up here in the condo the new bakers rack with the flat screen

218
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,760
It has everyone's it's all the rage now all the cool kids have the bakers rack for their studios

219
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,840
And a lot of and this whole thread start this whole conversation about standing or sitting and of course

220
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,840
When you need to talk about standing or sitting

221
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,880
Chacha listeners immediately go into well I stand, but I don't scrunch why I stand and I like sitting and full

222
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,920
I just

223
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,280
Whatever you do

224
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:35,000
Okay, we can stop the whole folder scruncher thing. I just I don't mind is when you send in an audio comment

225
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,280
Just end up with folder or scruncher and then we'll know that you're really a fan of the show

226
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:47,960
Hey Adam it's Gabrielle from second life. I just wanted to pass the word on to the DSC listeners

227
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:55,080
That we're going to have an opportunity for them to get together with other listeners and podcasters and

228
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:01,800
Podsay's music artists this Saturday in second life at the podshow palace mid summer masquerade

229
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,320
We're starting it at 2 p.m

230
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:11,880
Second life time which is also the same as the specific time and we plan on going as long as we can

231
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:19,000
Cover everybody in all the time zones. It's going to be a formal event and so I have everyone dressed up in their

232
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,160
Ball gowns and their

233
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,600
Tuxes and put on the masks and come and dance the night away to the pod Saint's music

234
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,320
So I hope to see you there and I hope to see many other DSC listeners come on in and join us for our fun

235
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,400
Right, okay Gabrielle. Thanks. Yeah, I'll drop by. I haven't talked about second life much lately

236
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,480
I've been so incredibly busy and

237
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,880
After mom passed you know, I just I really didn't feel like it

238
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,440
But I have you know, I drop in from time to time and the podshow island is definitely still cranking lots of

239
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,240
Interesting people living there now and of course we've got parties. I think just about every single day

240
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,480
So thank you very much Gabrielle for

241
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,680
For setting that up and let me know and letting the Charlie listeners know what's going on

242
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,680
um

243
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,680
I'm totally

244
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,600
Totally hammered by spam once again. This is this is really gotten out of control

245
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,520
My adamant curry dot com is pretty much rendered useless

246
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,720
I checked um I get about five

247
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,840
Spam messages per second now coming in I'm under some incredible attack and

248
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,440
The way I have my my email set up and it's um

249
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,640
You know this actually I think this actually qualify

250
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:42,760
I think it definitely qualifies the tin foil hat most

251
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,840
So the way I have it set up as I've got I've got this

252
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,640
Service from a company called I think what is it run box and

253
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:00,600
What run box does is it allows me to it's kind of what Google is offering now, but it allows you to manage

254
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:08,440
Your entire domain email because you know Patricia at curry dot com has to work and Christina at curry dot com and there's my sister's wheelo and Tiffany

255
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,240
And so there's a lot of management there and

256
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:19,960
I haven't set up so that all email that comes to me there is then forward it out to my Gmail account. That's pretty simple

257
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,560
The problem is

258
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:30,120
After I think 5,000 messages within a certain period within I don't like a three hour period

259
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:37,240
Then a run box shuts down and says wait a minute. This can't be right, you know either you're spamming or someone else is spamming and they're right

260
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,200
Actually because what happens is all that crap that spam

261
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,760
And it does filter out quite a bit

262
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,320
But certainly not everything you know is then just being sent on to my Gmail so I don't know

263
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,560
I'm just gonna kind of leave it so what happens is is

264
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:56,440
It'll it actually do receive the message, but it it goes into the run box email box and

265
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:02,280
And it's so I have to go in there to check it and I think if you send me a message and it and the

266
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,400
You know, it's in that period of I'm not gonna send anything through to atoms Gmail account

267
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,560
Then it does kick back some kind of message about a quota exceeded whatever

268
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,280
I'm just hoping that that'll stop the spammer. You know, they'll eventually catch on to the fact that you know

269
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,760
This is a dead email address or it's not it's certainly not selling anything for them

270
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,040
I just don't know what to do at this point. I mean the only other thing I could think of is to find yet

271
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:32,040
Another host who can do my my the email from my domain and who has even tighter spam

272
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,720
Controls and restrictions, but in the meantime if you really need to reach me

273
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,080
Send it to Adam at podshow.com and we'll see if we can see if we can keep that email

274
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,640
Address reasonably clean

275
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,920
Just for normal fucking communications. It's so disappointing that email has come to us

276
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,200
Yeah

277
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:05,000
Thank you very much. Just me. I got them right three small things first one shuttle falls

278
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,320
Right this is Daddy Dows by the way who's living this so voicemail comment. I'm not easily spooked

279
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,400
The only thing that I really couldn't watch on me on was to film the grudge

280
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,720
I'm gonna bit freaked out by that one switch it off

281
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,480
But I was listening a shuttle falls first episode the other night on me on in the house, but one on clock no more

282
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,920
And for myself actually I'm a switch it off

283
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,400
I couldn't listen very much. I was a has on the background next time and I'm absolutely fantastic

284
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,080
Yeah, I bet you that's true for a lot of people but I should try and listen to it together

285
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:43,960
It was like the second mix I believe that we heard and it is that enthralling you do kind of get drawn into it

286
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,600
And I can totally imagine if you're all by yourself and

287
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,600
Particularly if you have earbuds in because then you close off all ambient noise

288
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,600
I can I can see where you might get a bit freaked out spot on really enjoy that

289
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,040
The next thing was the blog you're running from Carl Alon thing. I'm guessing

290
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:07,320
That he's referenced to Alan instead of Adam is to block who does a radio talk show program in an orthting

291
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,920
Well, okay, this is the guy who were called in the other day and he and he said Alan and then corrected himself

292
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,080
Of course, it's either the other a Freudian slip right called Alan Robson

293
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,960
You can tell me if I'm wrong, but I think that's where it came from

294
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,920
What I'm wondering is how many people and in the UK are actually

295
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,280
Making a migration over from talk radio or to listen to podcasts like yours where that you know

296
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,760
There's a lot of talk a lot of chatbook more interactive

297
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,240
Just be interested to hear if that was the case we have more not put that you know

298
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,600
So of course in the in the UK

299
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,760
There's a quite a culture of listening to the radio a listening to people talking on the radio or listening to the

300
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,840
Wireless as we say

301
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,360
I think the BBC's doing a great job of letting people know what podcasts are and although at this point

302
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,240
For the BBC a podcast pretty much means

303
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:03,560
Show that was on the radio and you can now download and listen to on your own terms on your own time

304
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,200
I think the whole I at least they're getting the hey you can get

305
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,040
Audio and video entertainment online as well

306
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:19,480
That's good thing although I hate to think that people you know are now thinking of a podcast is a is a repeat of a show

307
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,440
But yeah, I think it's helping I think people are getting it the predictions are pretty pretty big for the UK

308
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,200
And there's a reason why we're opening up shop in in Britain

309
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:36,760
That's certainly where I've come from and the last thing is on Firefox I've got quite a few tabs on anyone time of maybe about 12

310
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:48,600
Now if you're pod show logo as nice as it is shows up for all subscriptions to any podcast with the word pod show written in and now I can't tell which

311
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,400
Which website I've got open with a tab so I'm just wondering if that's something that can be changed

312
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:59,000
So the actual name of the podcast shows up in the in the toolbar on Firefox where I'm an explorer

313
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,400
Of course instead of just the word pod show. It's getting really confused anyway. Love the show

314
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,880
You do yeah, of course. That makes a lot of sense. I actually had noticed that myself

315
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,040
I rarely look at at the toolbar. I don't know maybe I have seen it, but obviously

316
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:19,720
That's not right if you're on someone's a page it should say you know Adam's page or if you're on the daily source code

317
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:25,320
It should say daily source codes page and I'll do you one better even because of course we'll fix this

318
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:32,360
And boy, you know we have quite a list of stuff that is either being fixed or is just a pure enhancement

319
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:40,280
And what's on that list? I cannot share with our serious stars one-o-two listeners because we're about to say goodbye to them two for two Tuesday

320
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:45,560
My daughter will be on later tonight with pod save the queen so make sure you stay tuned to one-o-two

321
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,560
What we're gonna do is also

322
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,320
Whatever the

323
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,560
The backstage passes whatever the laminate picture is I think we could also make that the icon

324
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:01,880
To go in the tab which would maybe even though it's gonna be pretty small obviously would give you even more recognition of which tab you want to go to

325
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,240
Thank you very much for that

326
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:10,760
It's on list one-o-no Adam carry here is comic strip of blogger your European and union crisp on them

327
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,560
I would like to say that I am happy

328
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,520
I'm happy because last Friday

329
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,240
Italy has decided to open up Italy's label market

330
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:27,320
For workers from new European union countries from Eastern Europe Italy

331
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,240
Legally could wait till 2011

332
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:38,840
But they decided to open itself fully to new EU citizens now right now without waiting

333
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,720
So now free movement of people

334
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,640
for all EU citizens also from East

335
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,320
European Union is possible in UK

336
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,360
Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Spain, Portugal, Greece

337
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,880
The countries that still are

338
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,280
Resheristic and are blocking freedom of movement of new EU citizens are

339
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,080
Netherlands, Germany, France, Austria, Denmark

340
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,560
So I wanted to say

341
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,320
Multi-Catzi Amigitaliani or Pesiams Philippi in Sieme

342
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,600
Il Futuro Ruminoso de l'Unione europea

343
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,560
Gracias

344
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,600
Viva Italia

345
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,520
It is also good news for millions of Italian Americans

346
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,120
Because now they have proof that the country of religion is not actually stick after all

347
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,440
You're carry keep falling in your blackberry

348
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,480
Yes, I am a folder

349
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,480
Okay

350
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,320
That's comic strip blogger everybody

351
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,520
Thank you very much for the update. Yeah, they're just kind of weird

352
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,800
You know where Europe is definitely trying to become the United States of Europe

353
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,840
But you still can't travel freely and work in you know in another state and you were born in and

354
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,720
Is it really 2012 as I would say 2010 2012 when they legally have to change that man seems like

355
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,520
They should be moving along at a little faster clip

356
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
What was I gonna say here?

357
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,120
Oh, yeah, about comic strip blogger. You know from time to time

358
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,600
Post will pop up over at curry.com of

359
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:21,960
People who really seem to be in some kind of feud with with CSB and you know

360
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,640
I've I've pretty much just forgotten or ignored all this talk about how he's a stalker and how

361
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,160
He's always been writing horrible things about people and some people have gone to the police and

362
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,840
And you know CSB always wants to interview me. I'm thinking maybe we've got this the wrong way around

363
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,920
You know, maybe I should be interviewing comic strip blogger to find out what's really behind this

364
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,760
You know, it's his name really jacic and you know, why did he leave Nokia and you know

365
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,480
What does he make his money with is he independent and wealthy? I mean, I I kind of

366
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,840
You forget about a guy like this. I mean, don't you don't forget about him, but you forget about the whole history and then

367
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,640
It comes back and like you know this there really is something this is the whole reason why I was interested in comics

368
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,920
Your blogger in the first place is because he seems to have this very

369
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,920
murky

370
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,720
You know

371
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,040
Past not just past but but very cloudy is to where he lives what he does

372
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:21,320
And comister blogger could we turn it around could I interview you? But I mean really where you answer all the questions

373
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,320
I think it's about time that

374
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,320
listeners of the daily source code

375
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,920
Really find out who the who the true comic strip blogger is

376
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,880
Tell let me know if that's okay

377
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,880
some people reporting

378
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,840
some slow down in in accessing

379
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,640
some shows

380
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:45,560
Sometimes the daily source code sometimes other shows on the on the podcast delivery network

381
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:53,320
I think I figured it out because they really can only be one answer and it's this thing called packet shaping

382
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:02,200
Packet shaping is I guess you could say it's made well someone say it's part of the net neutrality to debate and I I totally disagree

383
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,400
But ISPs are getting so overloaded now with all this incoming traffic if we if we should if we really can believe the

384
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,760
That YouTube is serving up 100 million video views a day

385
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,200
Then that's going to be swamping someone somewhere and I think what's going on here is that

386
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:25,240
You know at certain peak times ISPs are just trying to throttle everything back to make it

387
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:33,000
You know make it at least accessible to everyone else which of course means we may still be quite a ways off from this all-time

388
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,240
Connected everything comes in flying fast streaming whatever you want

389
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,160
Which is I guess still very good then that we understand how we can

390
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:48,520
Time delay things and have things automatically download to your drive or to your to your iPod or whatever wherever you want something to go

391
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,320
But it definitely to me shows that the supply

392
00:29:54,040 --> 00:30:01,960
I really the demand if you will the demand for bandwidth is just to far outwaying the actual supply and I think it's going to we're gonna see some interesting moves

393
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,800
So then I truly believe this is being done

394
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,080
This packet shaping this kind of you know trying to to manage all this incoming bandwidth

395
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,320
It's just because they just don't have the bandwidth anymore

396
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,600
They just don't have the networks to support it and everyone's in the middle of you know of some form of of upgrade

397
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,480
And that's about the only thing I can see because and because I am also seeing this now happen to YouTube

398
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,760
I've seen lots of slow downs on on Google

399
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,560
so

400
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,720
I guess right now it's

401
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,760
This is what net neutrality is going to be it's good for the little guy the little guys don't seem to have any issues

402
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:42,680
Hey Adam this is Jeff Hines with a Friday night dance party and I'm wondering

403
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:49,080
If you're responsible for an artificial I read in the New York Times today

404
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,360
basically it said that Amazon dot com is starting

405
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,400
to sell groceries online

406
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,000
And actually the number one

407
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,320
seller for last week was since sale

408
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,200
So I'm wondering if you had anything with that so let me know and I'd be dead

409
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,680
here's my five well

410
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,480
Of course I had something to do with that. You kidding me

411
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:22,040
I mean, I don't I don't have a link up anymore. I used to have a since sale link up at Amazon actually and I would sell

412
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:28,200
Sometimes five six since sale machines a day and it just got so tedious never cash the checks anyway

413
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:34,040
Because you get I get the checks in England and you know it's almost impossible to cash an American check

414
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,680
For any size almost outside of the United States or to deposit a check it's very complicated

415
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,600
So and I kind of gave up on it. Yeah, I definitely know that I sold a lot

416
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,240
I mean the whole toy here for me is whenever you whenever you hear a burp

417
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,720
I want you to think senseo whenever you think senseo. I want you to think of daily source code

418
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,880
Senseo

419
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,560
So now whenever you look at Amazon I want you to think of senseo

420
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,120
I want you to think of burping. I want you to think of the daily source code all this has ever been

421
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,760
It's just one big promotion for this show. Okay

422
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,000
Let's take it on a happy note since we start off with the warmongering

423
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:20,040
It's natives of the new dawn whenever you wake up in the morning

424
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,560
Just remember crap. I woke up and you should be very happy

425
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,880
Because every day you get is a good day my friends

426
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,040
Let's let make today a good day

427
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,720
Wake up as time derives in shine just another day in this life for mine

428
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,280
I take up a deep rep my lungs still took a past he's got to be a good day

429
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,360
Wow, because there has to be stretch out my arms I tail out my worries

430
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,080
Retubernated no end of the possibilities

431
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:14,280
These are mine. It feels my blood never so becomes cold as I swing from the fire

432
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:19,800
I'm on some with time. I finally feel fine days as it should be of my own design

433
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,080
There's no one long like me to when I'll rest sleep and dream mine

434
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,880
Decating with them's are all that I need and I introduce a bad day and I hunt truth to be

435
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:33,320
Because you can't have a good day unless you believe every day good and bad will be around

436
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,240
So let's focus on listening to the park and it sounds a little bit

437
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,640
I'm going to talk about the bad day

438
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,520
Oh my friend, all the facts that we are here

439
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:55,160
That day next to day I got a good day

440
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:00,760
Well, but I'm not gonna lie

441
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,560
No one talks about the bad day

442
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:11,640
Oh my friend, all the facts that we are here

443
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:20,680
That day next to day I got a good day

444
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,280
Let's get late. The sun finds a whole rise in home, shadows stretch out

445
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,440
A risk-air flies in, flickering in the room, pulling the conversation,

446
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,480
Cones sets in, the moment of meditation, the old days playing back in my mind

447
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,920
The older people in their faces in this moment of time, summer

448
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,400
Wearing smiles on the spot, the wind and misery

449
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,960
Some find tomorrow while others become history

450
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,760
Now we're the wiping in the mighty floor for all the artists

451
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,720
The moon of the stars, all the solar lights are darkness

452
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,960
Could we be dumb as sitting in the convenience hard

453
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,320
As I learn about respect between the close and the pharmacy I

454
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,920
When the farmer in the season of the harvesters learn the soul of seeds

455
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,240
It I leave where the heart is now everything

456
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,000
Loving down the poopy around so that the focus on this and the other five

457
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,360
And it's down all the other way

458
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,240
No one talks about the bad day

459
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:17,800
Oh my friend, all the facts that we are here

460
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:24,840
That day next to day I got a good day

461
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:39,560
Oh my friend, all the facts that we are here

462
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:47,240
That day next to day I got a good day

463
00:35:47,240 --> 00:36:07,960
Oh my friend, all the facts that we are here

464
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:17,960
Oh my friend, all the facts that we are here

465
00:36:37,960 --> 00:37:04,680
Oh my friend, all the facts that we are here

466
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:11,720
Oh my friend, all the facts that we are here

467
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:18,440
That day next to day I got a good day

468
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:33,400
Oh my friend, all the facts that we are here

469
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:39,000
That day I got a good day

470
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,240
That really gets me going

471
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,760
