It's the pissed off Adam Curry.

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's the cheese of Adam Curry.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's the ticked off Adam Curry.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He's pissed off.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000

You gotta look somebody.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It ain't hard to do.

You've got some love on it.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Not bad.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000

You gotta love somebody.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You gotta love somebody.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Not somebody.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Not somebody.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Not a love.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
No man.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's a love for you.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's a normal man.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's a not for you.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Everybody now.

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
No one on that.

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You're handsin' the air with my like a just don't care.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Get mad at me.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's fake.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You're gon' dare.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You gotta love somebody.

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You gotta love somebody.

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Get the love.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh.

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You gotta love.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh.

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh.

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh.

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah.

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We never see the love.

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah.

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Because they never get past her back because they're rolled and broke down.

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I won't get over that.

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
These are a love!

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You gotta catch the love!

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah.

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We never see the love.

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Lovely to see the love!

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You never see the love!

79
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You never even swim!

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah.

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I never see the love!

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You never see the love!

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I look back.

84
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I see the love!

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,100
I don't care.

86
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,100
You say where I said right here, right now

87
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,100
Now see

88
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,100
That's another another

89
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,100
That you got to know, wanna know

90
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,100
That's a boy, never see your girl

91
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,100
That you're saying it doesn't end the whole wide world

92
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,100
Take it on the moon, take it on the moon

93
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,100
Give it to the stars, send it to your house

94
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,100
Even if you're gone, give it to the other

95
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,100
Love them with it down, never mind it come on

96
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,100
Get around town and smell the love

97
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,100
Spread it out there, spread the love

98
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,100
Shake it like I don't care

99
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,100
Love them with it

100
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,100
The fabulously talented Jeff Smith

101
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,100
With the love everybody song

102
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,100
Which he made just for me and for

103
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,100
And for magic as well

104
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,100
Wow, before that Derek Kay Miller did the

105
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,100
I'm creepy, pissed off curry

106
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,100
Show opener there

107
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,100
How are you doing everybody?

108
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,100
It's Monday the start of a new week

109
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,100
Daily source code is on coming you from the curry cottage

110
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,100
In the affluence suburb of Gilford and Surrey in the United Kingdom

111
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,100
Wow

112
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,100
Oh man, I'm still not completely decompressed

113
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,100
From 372 from Friday's show

114
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:30,100
And what an amazing thing has happened here

115
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,100
I still haven't really had the time to completely collect my thoughts about this

116
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,100
So I'll do my best today

117
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,100
Of course, if you haven't already, if you did here

118
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,100
Charlie 372

119
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,100
Please go and listen to Richard Bluesteens

120
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,100
Response on yeast2.com

121
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,100
That's where Richard surfaces versus Madge on yeast radio

122
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,100
You definitely have to listen to that

123
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,100
I think most people who've been a part of the conversation

124
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,100
Have already done that

125
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,100
And right off the top, just let me say that

126
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,100
Richard and I are cool

127
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,100
This is what you can do with people that you respect

128
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,100
And people that you love and people that you

129
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,100
That you trust, you know, you can have this type of conversation

130
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,100
Usually it's not held out in the open in the school yard

131
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,100
Like the way we did it

132
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,100
But we're totally cool just want to put that up front

133
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:25,100
And in fact, we haven't really had a full-blown conversation

134
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,100
Yet we've only had some email back and forth

135
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,100
And that's mainly due to time differences

136
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,100
And just schedules and all that stuff

137
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,100
But we're okay, totally okay

138
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,100
But boy, I think we've both learned quite a bit

139
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,100
Not just about the topic at hand

140
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,100
But about

141
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,100
About ourselves, perhaps, about heart relationship

142
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,100
And really, I've learned a tremendous about

143
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,100
I've really learned a couple of things about this show

144
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,100
And about podcasting

145
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,100
What was the most beautiful thing for me

146
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,100
Watching on this, there was not one, there's a couple

147
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,100
Let's start off by saying

148
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,100
That having a conversation about bigotry and about words

149
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,100
And actually being able to use the words was the most liberating thing

150
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,100
I've ever done in front of a microphone

151
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,100
Or a camera in my life

152
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,100
And I've been a broadcaster for

153
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,100
More than half my life

154
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,100
I've been a podcaster for over two years

155
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,100
But to actually talk about, you know, gaze and lesbians and fags

156
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,100
And queers and queens and dikes

157
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,100
And blacks and niggers and spicks and Jews

158
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,100
And all this stuff and actually be able to say the words

159
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,100
And not have people freak out about the conversation

160
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,100
Containing the words was a beautiful, beautiful thing

161
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,100
And it's a true testament to what we're doing here in podcasting

162
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,100
And I received so many audio feedbacks and emails

163
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,100
It's just no way I could ever even get to all of it

164
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,100
And I really don't think I should actually

165
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,100
Because I want to put this episode behind us

166
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,100
But move forward the momentum that we've picked up on here

167
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,100
Now, not only was that fantastic

168
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,100
That we had, you know, this conversation

169
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,100
And boy, it was a real conversation

170
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,100
And I have email

171
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,100
Okay, so here's what excites me very much

172
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,100
Is that for the first time in really

173
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,100
I'd have to say since I've been podcasting at all

174
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,100
The listeners came out

175
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,100
The listeners came out and started emailing me

176
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,100
And they typically start off by saying

177
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,100
What a podcaster, I'm just a listener

178
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,100
And here's what I have to say about it

179
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,100
Some of them literally came out

180
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,100
I think at least three or four people who emailed me

181
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,100
Came out and said, you know, I'm gay or lesbian

182
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
Or, you know, I'm not completely out

183
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,100
Not everyone knows it and here's my feelings

184
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,100
About the whole conversation

185
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,100
Which was, I mean, gosh, when someone comes out to you

186
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,100
Whether it's in person or an email

187
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,100
That's a huge, huge thing

188
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,100
In fact, let me just read one email that I received

189
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,100
So I removed the name obviously

190
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,100
After listening to your show

191
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,100
Number 372, I felt that I had to write you

192
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,100
And share my opinions. First of all, I'm a lesbian

193
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,100
And I'm not fully out of the closet yet

194
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,100
My friends know, but that's pretty much it

195
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,100
Anyway, when I first started accepting that I was gay

196
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
I became very offended when I heard people say things

197
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
Like fruitcake, dike, faggot, et cetera

198
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,100
I stopped becoming offended when I realized that

199
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,100
Every person that says faggot or gay

200
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,100
Or what not, it's not a homophobic

201
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,100
It's not trying to be offensive

202
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,100
It's not trying to promote hate towards homosexuals

203
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,100
And most times, they're not even referring to homosexuals

204
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,100
And I don't think it was fair match to say things that you did

205
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,100
I really enjoyed the show because I think it's a wake-up call

206
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,100
To those who are so offended by name calling

207
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,100
And feel it the world owes them something

208
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,100
Arguing over semantics is not going to save

209
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,100
One homosexual from suicide

210
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,100
Creating a more tolerant world

211
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,100
That accepts people for who they are

212
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,100
Will

213
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,100
Thank you very much for this show

214
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,100
Well, thank you very much for that comment

215
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,100
I got a lot of comments like that

216
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
But the fact that listeners

217
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
We're now coming out of the quote woodwork

218
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,100
And speaking up really hit me

219
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,100
And as I started to evaluate

220
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,100
And I continuously evaluate

221
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,100
The daily source code

222
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
I continue

223
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,100
And the feedback that you give me

224
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
And of course, everyone has their own opinion

225
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,100
And some people like long shows

226
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Some people like short shows, some people

227
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,100
Rather have five short shows

228
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Some people would have it, rather have three longer shows

229
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Some people want promo

230
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
Some people hate promo

231
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,100
But one thing is very sure

232
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,100
It's very certain for me is that

233
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
We're still really

234
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
Too much of a closed off

235
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,100
Excuse me, Sensei

236
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,100
Close off community

237
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,100
And it's not by design

238
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,100
It's not a fault in any way

239
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,100
But if I think about who's really sending me feedback

240
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,100
And who's participating in the source code

241
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,100
It is overwhelmingly other podcasters

242
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,100
So that to me means that something should change

243
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,100
Because now finally

244
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,100
And you know I love getting feedback

245
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,100
From people who are listeners

246
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,100
By the way, if you send me an email

247
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,100
Or if you get around to making audio comment

248
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,100
And I guess what I really should do

249
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,100
And that's part of the problem here

250
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
And we're just not ready yet with podshow

251
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,100
Plus in the pdn

252
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,100
But the minute that's out

253
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
It should be a heck of a lot easier for people

254
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,100
For listeners who maybe don't have the the means

255
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,100
The technological understanding etc

256
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
To just send feedback

257
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,100
Maybe you just have some widget

258
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,100
You know you just download that

259
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,100
And you click it and as long as you have a microphone

260
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,100
You click once to record and click again

261
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
And it sends it off or something like that

262
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,100
That would be probably very smart

263
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,100
And I think of it

264
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100
I really want to tap into that more

265
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,100
Because that's where we're going to really get some growth

266
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,100
From in this stuff that we're doing

267
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,100
Is involving the listener more

268
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,100
And I really do believe now that the listeners who are out there

269
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,100
Are just listening and and

270
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,100
And maybe some of them will say yeah

271
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
You know I'd love to do a podcast in the future

272
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,100
And in fact we'll talk about that later

273
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,100
Yesterday I met a couple of folks who said exactly that

274
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,100
But to actually for the first time

275
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,100
Have listeners who have nothing to do with the

276
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Development of podcasting

277
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,100
Nothing to do with the creative side of creating podcast

278
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,100
Was just very very exciting to me

279
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,100
Mark Yoshimoto Nemkov sent in a comment

280
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,100
Who was of course in a way also involved in

281
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,100
In this conversation

282
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Mark from the Pacific Coast Hellway

283
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,100
And he probably had the best line

284
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,100
That I encountered and all this feedback

285
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
He says dude

286
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
I love the fact that you defended my name

287
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,100
And all uncut guys and nearly the same breath

288
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,100
Yeah

289
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,100
And you know

290
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,100
And I think I said that on Fridays

291
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,100
That I'm so envious often of

292
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,100
People like Mark who couldn't who can write a rant

293
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,100
And then deliver that

294
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
Because I'm pretty much sure he writes all his stuff

295
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,100
He's a fantastic writer and

296
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
And to be able to to write something

297
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,100
And deliver the rant and make it sound like

298
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
It's you know it's coming out at that moment

299
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,100
Is really

300
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,100
That's you got to have talent to do that

301
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,100
And by the way

302
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Magic has obviously has that talent as well

303
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
I'm not very good at it

304
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
But what you heard Friday and this is something

305
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,100
That I also have to take into consideration

306
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,100
You heard the non-splift version of the curry

307
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,100
And now you know why Patricia suggested

308
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,100
Like 19 almost 20 years ago

309
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,100
When we were

310
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,100
We'd been together for about six months or so

311
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,100
She said you know you really should try smoking dope once in a while

312
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,100
And that'll stop your brain that'll slow you down a bit

313
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,100
And I hadn't done so

314
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,100
Since Thursday afternoon

315
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
All the way through Friday

316
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,100
Because I really wanted to have my head on straight

317
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,100
But what happens is is then all the stuff comes up

318
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,100
The stuff that is of course normally suppressed

319
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,100
By the holy herb

320
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,100
And so there's good news and bad news there

321
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,100
Good news is boy

322
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
I'll probably live a hell of a lot longer

323
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,100
If I continue my daily regimen

324
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,100
And a nice and calm and cool and collected on the other hand

325
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,100
The stuff that came out

326
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,100
And the way it came out

327
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,100
And as I was going through this show

328
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,100
Which I had really hadn't done any preparation

329
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Other than just set up the audio stuff that I wanted to play

330
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,100
I could feel it

331
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
I felt like wow

332
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
I'm in this

333
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
The rant is working

334
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,100
It's trucking along

335
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,100
I felt like I was making some sense

336
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,100
But really

337
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,100
It's incredibly emotionally draining

338
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,100
So now what is it that

339
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,100
That caught everyone

340
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,100
And was it just the word that we're using

341
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,100
Was it just the conversation

342
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,100
Yes, I think that's a big part of it

343
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,100
Obviously and this is something we've known

344
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,100
We've been saying for a long time

345
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,100
You know as long as you podcast with passion

346
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,100
Well

347
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,100
I think that may be partially correct

348
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,100
It's not just the passion

349
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,100
It is when someone hears the true emotion

350
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,100
Coming out of another human being

351
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,100
That's when

352
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,100
People get switched on

353
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,100
That is

354
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,100
Part of what is so incredibly different

355
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,100
And I've been thinking about this all week

356
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,100
And even though it's been a very busy week

357
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,100
And then I haven't had a lot of downtime

358
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,100
Crunch and turnily and try and figure this out

359
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,100
But that is it

360
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,100
Now luckily

361
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,100
We don't only have one emotion

362
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,100
Anger of course is one that

363
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,100
I think that maybe we all

364
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,100
Well here's a good one for you

365
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,100
Is everyone's version of the emotion anger the same

366
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,100
I think it probably comes close

367
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,100
And this is

368
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,100
This is why guys like a Rush Limbaugh

369
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,100
I think as an example

370
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100
It probably goes after the lowest hanging fruit

371
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,100
Of the emotional tree

372
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,100
By poking at people's emotions

373
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,100
And getting them all pissed off and angry

374
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,100
By being emotional and pissed off and angry

375
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,100
That's where you make a connection

376
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,100
As I said I think that's

377
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,100
Sometimes it can be fantastic

378
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,100
Anger can be really good

379
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,100
Anger is in many ways a beautiful emotion

380
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,100
But there's no way that I'll be able to make a show

381
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,100
As the pissed off Adam Curry

382
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
There's just no way

383
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,100
And even if I could do it

384
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,100
I'm not going to do it

385
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,100
It's very draining

386
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,100
And if quite frankly it's not all that fun

387
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,100
The release is fantastic

388
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,100
I mean that's like one huge intellectual orgasm

389
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,100
But you know it's

390
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,100
It's only once noile type of

391
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,100
Type of experience as you want to have

392
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,100
So what I want to try and do

393
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,100
It's figure out how to tap into all the emotions

394
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,100
And really make that connect

395
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,100
This is perhaps what I first heard

396
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,100
With Dawn and Drew

397
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,100
Before it became before it really was

398
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,100
The Dawn and Drew show

399
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,100
And this is not a bad thing at all

400
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,100
Because I'm going through the exact same

401
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,100
I'm going down the exact same path

402
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
As many many podcasts are doing

403
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,100
What was it that I loved about Dawn and Drew

404
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,100
In the beginning and still do by the way

405
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,100
Is the emotional connection

406
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,100
Two people had who have clearly been together

407
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
For a long time and you can hear it

408
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,100
And it's a beautiful thing

409
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,100
It's exactly the same

410
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
Oh wow experience

411
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,100
I had the first time I saw

412
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,100
The Osborns

413
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,100
The very first season of the Osborns

414
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,100
Which was a very low budget

415
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
Greg Johnson who I worked with for years

416
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,100
Produced that

417
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,100
Because he knew Ozzy or had some connection

418
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
There and it was really two cameras

419
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
And really just nothing

420
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,100
Thought out ahead of time

421
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
And it was really beautiful

422
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,100
Because what happened was everyone said

423
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,100
Oh my gosh

424
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,100
There's a guy who I had a

425
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,100
It was of course a big brain reset

426
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
I thought that he was this hardcore rocker

427
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
Biting the heads off of bats

428
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,100
And it turns out he's

429
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,100
Like Archie Bunker and he has a dysfunctional family

430
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Like mine and they have arguments

431
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
And they have love and it's all very raw

432
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
And pure and it's not polished

433
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,100
And of course we've seen that with many

434
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,100
Reality programs

435
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,100
And that doesn't have a change

436
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,100
This thing start to get set up

437
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,100
And written

438
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,100
And I think that that was the

439
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,100
That's really what I'd like to tap into

440
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
Now of course we have multiple emotions

441
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,100
And I think

442
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
Some of that Donna drew stuff

443
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,100
Or any two people who

444
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,100
Who are in life together

445
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,100
When they have a conversation

446
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,100
It's just nice to hear when Patricia comes in

447
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,100
Everyone loves it

448
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,100
I have never heard anyone say that they don't like it

449
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,100
When Patricia comes on this show

450
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
Or when I'm talking to Christina

451
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,100
When we're doing dad daughter stuff

452
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,100
Or I think laughter

453
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,100
Of course is something an emotion that everyone can tap into

454
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,100
That's very very difficult

455
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,100
I'm not good at that at all

456
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,100
It either happens naturally or it doesn't

457
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,100
I'm not very good at setting up jokes and bits and

458
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,100
And fun stuff

459
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,100
And usually just me laughing at myself

460
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,100
Doing something stupid works

461
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,100
And then there's love

462
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,100
That's another

463
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,100
That's part of the

464
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,100
The duo

465
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Host thing

466
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
Which you can really hear a

467
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,100
Love emotion

468
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,100
Something else that's played into a lot

469
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,100
Well in fact all the time by news media

470
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,100
Is your fear emotion

471
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Because it's very easy

472
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,100
I mean that's what a

473
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,100
Usment park rides are based on fear

474
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,100
So I hope I'm sounding a little bit coherent here

475
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,100
But I'm really trying to hone in on

476
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Figuring out

477
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,100
How I can tap into that more to make this show better

478
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Because I want to reach more people

479
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,100
For me the success of the daily source code

480
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,100
Is in

481
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
More people who are participating

482
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,100
Actively

483
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,100
Whether that's through email or whether it's through

484
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,100
You know a voice mail

485
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,100
Or or just saying hey

486
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,100
I'm listening and you know it

487
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,100
It really makes it all worthwhile

488
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,100
And it really has me excited

489
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,100
Now that said

490
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,100
I got some very important emails

491
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,100
From people

492
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,100
Important because they really struck home

493
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,100
And I've mentioned this particular

494
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,100
Type of email to a couple other people

495
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,100
And the response is always the same

496
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,100
It's oh yeah

497
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,100
And I also must say that I forgot

498
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,100
Momentarily

499
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,100
That both match

500
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
But certainly Richard Blustine

501
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,100
Are still in a grieving period

502
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,100
For the loss of one

503
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
And boy

504
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,100
You know that can really

505
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,100
Reset your that can mess up your filters and your brain

506
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,100
The only people who can

507
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,100
Forgive someone who is grieving

508
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,100
And says or does certain things

509
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,100
Our friends and family

510
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,100
Because they understand that person

511
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,100
And of course I forgive Richard

512
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,100
Are you crazy? I love it

513
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,100
He's a great guy

514
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,100
And so that's just something I wanted to make sure that everyone just

515
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,100
Thought about for a second because that does put some of this into perspective

516
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,100
But you know it doesn't matter again

517
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,100
I do it all over again if we could because what happened

518
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,100
And the beauty of everyone

519
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,100
Jumping in

520
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,100
And very civilly I must say yeah

521
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,100
There was a little bit of there's always some

522
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,100
Signal to noise in in that type of conversation

523
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,100
But much lower noise than signal

524
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,100
And then I've seen in a long long time

525
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,100
So thank you all for participating

526
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,100
Thank you all for participating

527
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,100
Thank you all for being a part of it

528
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,100
And thank you all for just

529
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,100
Changing something in me

530
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,100
So I'm going to try and continue on it

531
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,100
I'm going to try and figure out what it is

532
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,100
And try to do a lot more of it

533
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:08,100
Are we are we just only now starting to understand the power of the internet

534
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,100
This oh wow

535
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,100
I think that maybe in five years

536
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,100
We will only just have reached the tipy top of this

537
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,100
Of this iceberg that is underneath the blue ocean of how powerful

538
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,100
I don't know if you can you can't really control it

539
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,100
But I've gotten pretty good identifying flow and seeing

540
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,100
When something catches on

541
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,100
And there's nothing you can once it catches

542
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,100
There's nothing you can do about it

543
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,100
You can only

544
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,100
You can just ride it out

545
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,100
If you happen to be on the wave

546
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,100
You can see it coming

547
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,100
There's not much you can do to turn it left to right

548
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,100
Now the question is how do you get stuff like that started

549
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,100
But I don't want it to be negative

550
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,100
Sometimes it can be negatives

551
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,100
It's clearly always based on people's emotions

552
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,100
And I think that we are

553
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,100
We've got the training wheels on friends

554
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,100
We are just

555
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,100
Just getting started in

556
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,100
Understanding

557
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,100
What this stuff is

558
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,100
And it's big it is so much bigger

559
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,100
And we don't know how to use it at all

560
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,100
That that's what this whole episode show me

561
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,100
We have no clue

562
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,100
You know you just you just lighten matches

563
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,100
And you're you're slamming stones together

564
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,100
And also fire

565
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,100
Look, in fact, maybe that is exactly what this is

566
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,100
We are the cavemen of

567
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,100
Gerati, you know we're just a

568
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,100
Fire, this is wonderful fire

569
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,100
And we haven't learned how to contain it

570
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,100
We're a long way off from nuclear

571
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,100
You know what I'm saying? We've got such a long way to go

572
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,100
So

573
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,100
I looked around for a song

574
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,100
It's going to run over the satellite

575
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,100
We know for those you're listening on

576
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,100
Serious starts 102

577
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,100
You'll get to PCH next and you won't hear the entire song

578
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,100
But I thought it was so appropriate

579
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,100
And I know that module totally understand

580
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,100
And this is really true at the end of the day

581
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:32,100
I do when I think I always will

582
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:38,100
Say I love fucking with you

583
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,100
Now that I bow to Chris

584
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,100
Go into dance

585
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,100
No point to blame

586
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,100
Destiny

587
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,100

Destiny

616
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,100
Holding up to no better

617
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:58,100
Stand my ground in this degree

618
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:06,100
For all the difference it never makes

619
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:12,100
Stand my ground in this degree

620
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:24,100
Stand my ground in this degree

621
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:33,100
Stand my ground in this degree

622
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:46,100
Stand my ground in this degree

623
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:52,100
Stand my ground in this degree

624
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:58,100
Stand my ground in this degree

625
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:12,100
Now you watch me dig-y, my own gray, sailor fucking way

626
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:26,100
Sailor, sailor, sailor, sailor, sailor

627
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:56,100
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

628
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:26,100
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

629
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:31,680
11 when you just say it in the song, you know, just use the words and say it really really works for me and throughout all this

630
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,520
I've seen changes in many many people. Most prevalent

631
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,580
Most prevalent is

632
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,580
our friend

633
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,900
Comic strip

634
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,340
Comic strip

635
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,700
Comic strip

636
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,700
Comic strip

637
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,100
Now listen to this one by C.S.B.

638
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:06,180
Hello, Adam Carey made. We have 21st century nowadays and also we still don't have flying cars and

639
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:11,860
intelligent robots. We have global cyberspace calls these days the internet

640
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:19,140
People damage and attack other people in this global cyberspace to a very high extent

641
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,940
That they wouldn't do in person to person contacts

642
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:30,380
There are three things that are important to me in cyberspace contacts one good wheel to

643
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,220
reciprocate mutual two-sided respect and three open-ness

644
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:41,340
So one good wheel means that I don't want to harm other people over internet

645
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:50,220
Two respect means that I don't ridicule and I take seriously other people and their convictions and feelings

646
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:58,380
Three open-ness means that if somebody tells me that something what I wrote on the internet is a harming

647
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,780
or damaging him or her

648
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:10,180
Then I'm open and ready to take it down or remove it. I am the first ever paid advertiser in podcasting

649
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,260
I am fan of podcasting

650
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:17,460
Hi, let me just stop there for one second. C.S.B. and you know very few people know this or remember this

651
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,460
But that is absolutely true

652
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,460
comic strip blogger was

653
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,780
As far as I know the first person to advertise on a podcast

654
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,380
And he did it by buying time on the Donandru show before

655
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,940
For Donandru were a part of the pod show family and

656
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,820
And in the end he did pay you know and he was promoting MS mobiles

657
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:48,980
MS mobiles.com so I think was MS mobiles.com or or Microsoft mobile in general. I can't recall

658
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,980
But that is absolutely true and

659
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:58,740
Definitely deserves credit for that. However, I see that podcasting is troubled with the same problems that blocking is

660
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:04,660
People attack people without willingness to remove lies surrender from the servers

661
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,420
God gave us free wheel for a reason

662
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:15,540
God in this way washes his hands of responsibility for our evil deeds

663
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:22,980
But at the same time free wheel gives us ability to achieve great things or to do good deeds

664
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:31,380
The best kept secret of God is that the hell and heaven are in a reality here and now on earth

665
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,460
Boohoo

666
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,460
You've made my day with it. Boohoo

667
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,260
Boo yeah

668
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:46,020
CSB getting all intellectual love it. You're right comment your blogger sees it

669
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,860
He sees it we we still have our training wheels on and what we're doing now

670
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:54,900
In blogging and in podcasting is we're exercising our emotions

671
00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:00,900
We're exercising our feelings we're exercising our free speech and I hope we can get past the training wheel stage pretty soon

672
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,420
Cause man, I'm ready to ride the bike for really, you know, I got to figure it out

673
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:11,220
I've got to figure out how to how to stay balanced and then this internet thing is going to be extremely powerful

674
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:16,260
Yes, we can shoot then we can read if we figure out how to use it how to harness

675
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,500
Our emotions and how to project those emotions take emotions from others

676
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:30,260
Mix them up into into something that everybody can identify with and share with and it not just be anger and it not just be fear

677
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,740
Then we truly can change the world. I'm convinced of it

678
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:39,460
So I'm going to work on it. I'm going to try and figure it out and that doesn't mean that I'm not going to get it stuff

679
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:47,540
Because that is you know, anger is a beautiful emotion just not all the time. It can be very tiring and we know how to get it out of me now

680
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:52,580
Don't we and it's not just a comment. It's it's the lack of spliffage in my case

681
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
Okay, so let's look at the week that was Friday

682
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,860
Over the weekend of course, I got up early Saturday morning to go fly and see my mom in

683
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:09,860
She lives in bullscope which is about so a 25 minute cab ride from the Rotterdam Jet Center

684
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:15,700
So I'd agreed with Captain Dan who now Captain Dan is also starting to loosen up a little bit

685
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:20,020
You know the first the flight we made. I was like, you know, anyone who's flown

686
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:26,020
You're you're you're really dependent upon each other and there's a lot of trust you throw into the cockpit right off the bat

687
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:32,020
Particularly with a much less experienced pilot as myself. I have to put a lot of my trust

688
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,940
Into someone who has the paperwork, but you really don't know the guy and

689
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:41,060
But you do start to build up camaraderie very quickly and Saturday

690
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:44,420
We had our big camaraderie moment which I

691
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:50,260
Actually debated for a while talking about this, but since I'm still here. I'm very happy to tell you

692
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,980
Everything was great the weather

693
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:58,740
Just fantastic on the on the UK side of the channel Rotterdam was not so nice at all

694
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,820
It was the ceiling was a thousand feet. They'd predicted 2000 feet, but it was a thousand so

695
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,420
Not the best weather at all to be to be flying in now

696
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:12,020
What we did is and what I'm doing with with Captain Dan is we do not use the GPS while we're flying

697
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:15,300
It's all instrument work. So we're really stacking up the radios now

698
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:22,580
This is for another podcast maybe a whole separate podcast not for the Charlie, but how you fly on instruments is

699
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,380
It's really quite interesting. You're doing it all based upon radio signals and

700
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:32,100
Directional beacons things called VORs and NDBs and

701
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:38,260
DMEs a distance measuring equipment, so you so you know how far you are from a certain beacon and you try and

702
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,740
You're late so you can figure out where you are and you do that with a map and

703
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:46,340
Of course these days we have the luxury of flying with with a GPS where it shows you

704
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,340
Have you don't have to figure out how far away you are from a certain beacon to be able to

705
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:54,980
Triangulate it to know if you're flying into someone's restricted airspace. No, it's right on the map

706
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,500
You see a little airplane moving towards the circle and you know what you're doing

707
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:03,140
But if you don't have a GPS or if your GPS malfunctions

708
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,540
Well, then you better know what you're doing in order to get out and also a part of

709
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:14,260
The night flying and the bad weather flying is all done on these instruments in coordination with air traffic control

710
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:20,100
But you really have to understand the concept of flying and and you've got to work ahead of the aircraft

711
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,100
You know we're doing 150 knots

712
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,580
Which is fast

713
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,580
Okay, it's really fast

714
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:33,380
Even though it's not entirely true just you can take a knot for a my it's a nautical miles actually so 150 is fast

715
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,380
And

716
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:40,180
You've got to work you know, so the between you know in ten miles at 150 miles now

717
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:45,940
It doesn't take you very long, you know, that's just that's just a matter of minutes and so you really have to have everything dialed up

718
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:51,140
And you're next next reporting point your next beacon you have to be able to tune into it

719
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:56,340
So it's really nice to be able to do that with two people particularly someone who's been doing it for a long time

720
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,340
Now we crossed over the channel and and I put that video up on

721
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:05,380
On the curry dot com so you can take a look at the just fantastic weather over the channel

722
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:10,100
It was blue skies you could see right down to the to the deck you could see the the ships going by now

723
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,100
If you look closely at that video you'll see

724
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,300
something a very bad habit of mine

725
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,380
Which was broken

726
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,380
Significantly

727
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,380
During this flight is I often

728
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,740
Just because I want less clutter on my lap. You know, I've got a clipboard and as pen and stuff and you know

729
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:32,500
You've got you there's a lot going on on the cockpit. I often will take my map fold it up and shove it on the on the dashboard

730
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,060
Kind of wedge it between the door frame the dashboard and and a little bit of the window

731
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,460
And this is this was not a good thing

732
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:47,940
Here's what happened as we're flying along and we were on frequency the Dutch military Dutch mill frequency

733
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:53,860
Which is what everyone kind of does on the weekend because in in the Netherlands there are very few airfields

734
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:57,060
There's people don't like people flying in Holland let me tell you

735
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:03,060
So the airfields that are there are usually military and they're closed on weekends

736
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:07,380
If you ever want to invade that country by the way the weekend is the time to go because everyone's off everyone's at home

737
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,260
So the airfields are not active and

738
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,700
You talk to Dutch mill and Dutch mill basically talks to the you know

739
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,940
They have radar and they're checking out everybody and and of course sometimes you can get very busy

740
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:23,140
Wasn't all that busy because of the weather and so we're flying somewhere between

741
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:31,540
Where are we at between Costa if you're a pilot it's a KO code COA which is a VOR

742
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:37,940
And HSD which is between Costa and Rotterdam so you know we we've got like another

743
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:43,300
Like another 20 minutes to run or so and Dutch mill calls me up and says okay

744
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,260
We have an unidentified aircraft flying at your

745
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,780
Altitude we were at that point it was still good weather

746
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,780
So we were about 20 300 feet

747
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,340
It says they're not on frequency

748
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,620
I do not know what their intentions are and they're coming at your 12 o'clock

749
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:02,500
That means straight on the nose and he was flying apparently to about 2000 feet

750
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,420
So

751
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,420
First thing you say is right I got you

752
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,900
We're on a sharp lookout and believe me you're then on a very sharp lookout and

753
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,900
I actually even said you know what I'm gonna I'm going to descend

754
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:22,420
What do we I think now he was it we're both at 2300 feet so I'm gonna say the 2000 feet just to give a little bit of margin there

755
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,460
Just just in case and any on there he was all of a sudden we saw him

756
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,940
He wasn't quite at 12 o'clock who is at 11 o'clock but he was coming our way and

757
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:35,620
He was at that point a little bit higher than we were now we were just under the under the cloud ceiling

758
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,620
Remember I told you it was around 2000 feet

759
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,460
So yeah, actually it was probably two that two and a half thousand feet at that point

760
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,780
But we're going north and so the ceiling is starting to drop

761
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:49,060
So we call that in we say hey, you know Dutch mill we're visual on him and at that point

762
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:55,300
The air traffic control marks it off as list. Okay, they can see him. It's done no problem

763
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:01,620
And remember he's on the on the 11 o'clock side so that's on and I'm left left seat of the airplane so

764
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,820
He was just off to the left

765
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,820
And

766
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:10,900
We're flying along and we're getting set up for rotted in because we knew the ceiling was gonna be much lower

767
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:18,340
We had to hit all the reporting points. It's a real airport, you know, it's not something we just kind of fly in join and land

768
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,020
And this is a other aircraft, which

769
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,940
It was a low wing it was a small low wing so I the pipe are probably it went up into the clouds

770
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:33,380
And while I'm dialing up the other frequency and this is just the matter of maybe 30 seconds

771
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:39,380
Maybe 45 seconds. Well, I'm dialing up the other frequency. Thank God Dan has eyes open

772
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:44,900
And he's this is kind of the agreement. You know you never are both looking at the same thing in the cockpit at the same time

773
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:50,980
Certainly not more than for just a few seconds because you're going so fast and shit happens so fast and all of a sudden

774
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,500
Dan says

775
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,700
Cricky he's turning and what it happened was this guy

776
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:01,700
Never saw us because there was no way for anyone to tell him that we were in his area and he came

777
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,820
Back down from the clouds. I guess that he got kind of freaked out or whatever you want to get out of the clouds

778
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,980
Also now he's down exactly at our level

779
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:16,340
He's so close and he's turning left right into us. I could almost read his registration and so you know

780
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:22,580
Simultaneously we're both like yanking to the right down with the nose and you know

781
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,580
I literally could see this guy's face

782
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,020
As he passed over us

783
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:36,740
And the reason why I didn't see him was because the map had obscured that part of my peripheral

784
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:43,780
Vision and that was really really stupid and I'm very happy that Captain Dan was there

785
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:49,300
But we both literally sat there for like 20 seconds just looking at each other going

786
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,860
Dude

787
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,860
That could have been a real day record

788
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,860
Of course Dan is like oh that could have given us a headache

789
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,220
Yeah, so you make light of it and you make jokes about it but

790
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:08,500
Between us there was a huge understanding that we had been very fortunate in

791
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,900
You know the past couple of minutes

792
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:18,900
And it was just a big big learning lesson for me tremendous and and I've broken the the stupid map habit

793
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,940
Let me tell you anyone who's a pilot will know exactly what I'm talking about and you might even do it yourself sometimes

794
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,700
So I'm very thankful

795
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:33,220
For having Captain Dan a long for the ride and you know once again have realized that

796
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:40,980
The book of aviation you just don't finish it. It's a it's a book about 15 feet high and every single time you go and fly

797
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,980
You learn something new

798
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,300
So that anyway, so we landed safely and everything was great

799
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:53,620
It was kind of it was still kind of tricky figuring out exactly where we are and just remember just using the instruments

800
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:59,220
Trying to find these reporting points and reporting points are usually a spot in the road or a gas station that you can see

801
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:04,340
But if you're not familiar with it if there's you know traffic in the area if you're doing all kinds of stuff

802
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,820
You're flying at instruments. It's hard to identify stuff

803
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,100
So you really got to stay focused and they're not you know they don't have beacons

804
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,620
You have to figure out okay, this reporting port a point is this far from this beacon

805
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:19,300
It's on this radio so it means that it's kind of over there and you can really do this quite well and and it worked out

806
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,500
You know it was great and we landed one off to see my mom

807
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:29,300
It was really cool because my sister was there Tiffany with her son Julius who's almost seven. I haven't seen him in

808
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:34,660
Boy I haven't seen him in almost half a year and my sister who recently

809
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,020
Separated from her husband recently about a year ago

810
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,980
She has a great new boyfriend who I know

811
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:48,660
Professionally from his writer and it was cool. Yeah, and Christina and Patricia had bought a wig from my mom and

812
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:52,420
She was so happy because you know going through all this cancer crash

813
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:57,780
That's really the bummer. You know it's just you you you you feel shitty on the inside

814
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:02,340
But all that carries over to the outside and she's lost a lot of weight and and of course

815
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:08,580
Because of the chemo and radiation. She's lost most of her hair and she was so happy. She was so happy to have

816
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:16,660
You know just to look her and it went and Patricia is really good at this. You know, she's she really understands

817
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:23,380
Hair and makeup as we've discussed many times and it was perfect. She was so happy and and you know

818
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:29,060
It was it was emotional. It really was but it was great and we hung out for for a couple hours and it was just fun

819
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,060
You know we didn't talk about

820
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:35,860
About cancer and treatments and crap. We just had fun and joked and laughed and my mom was really

821
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:41,540
Compared to last week. She was ten times as energetic of course a lot of that is due to

822
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,300
The pretneys on that that they're giving her right now because she has to strengthen up a bit in case

823
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,780
They need to do more treatments. She really they couldn't treat her now. They just they she has to have more strength

824
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,980
But she's been eating much more and and she's really really fighting it and I can see it, you know

825
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:02,100
And that's that's the most important thing and and I think this was probably the first visit

826
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,860
Where we didn't have to talk about all that crap no one felt like talking about it

827
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:10,340
Just you know talk about fun and going place isn't doing things and she's not giving up man

828
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:15,620
That's that's what was so beautiful about about the day and then went back

829
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,940
I'll tell you there's nothing cooler

830
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:25,540
For for for someone who's so nuts about aviation and just the whole concept of a flying car

831
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:30,980
And you know you're you're talking to all these people along the way and then you have pharaohs and

832
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,780
Sight as we're coming in I call up pharaohs on the radio

833
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:40,100
You know November 277 Delta Shara is is joining downwind and and then on the radio

834
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,660
Hi Adam welcome home

835
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,060
Wow, you know

836
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,300
Hi Adam welcome home

837
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:51,220
No traffic in circuit come on in and park her at your hangar and that was

838
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,900
It was uh, it was nice

839
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,540
Uh

840
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,900
And I got some feedback about my flight as well. I think this is the one home

841
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,700
I Adam it's Mike from the 6620 West kid cast

842
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,500
Hey after listening to Charlie number 370

843
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:10,340
I also noticed that the air traffic controller sounded just like Roger Smalls

844
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,620
So I took that clip. I did a little audio clean up to it and now if you listen to it

845
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,580
I think it's conclusive here listen to this

846
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,420
Want to call up and yeah get us out

847
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:28,500
Transformation good morning November 277 Delta Shara request radio check and then taxi to a board for the

848
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,500
Aquarium

849
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,500
Roger

850
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,460
It's how the proper one

851
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,860
We're going for the

852
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,980
Oh and one other thing Adam last year

853
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:55,380
I sent you an audio comment in a phony Italian accent begging the pod father to let us into pod show

854
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:00,660
You told me that after the new year you would make me an offer I couldn't refuse

855
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,740
Well

856
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,260
Coupledy to the copy. I hope that offers still stands

857
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:14,100
I would love to be invited to pod show and just as an observation I think pod show could use more family oriented programming

858
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:21,140
You know we get lots of feedback from our listeners that thank us for doing a podcast that they can listen to with their kids in the room

859
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:25,700
We're proud to be a hundred percent clean and we're a hundred percent kid friendly

860
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:31,140
Our show isn't really intended for kids. It's more for adults who have kids and are looking for a

861
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:36,900
Kindred spirit to share experiences with if any of your listeners are looking for this type of a podcast

862
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,420
Where the 66-20 West kid cast at

863
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:53,140
W-w-w dot 66-20 West dot calm. I don't even get it. She's senior. Okay. Yeah, I'll make good on my promise. Don't you worry

864
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:58,420
I said after the new year, right and and I said after this new year and we're still after the new year

865
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,060
We're getting there very closely. The dev cast is rocking

866
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:08,740
Now it's gonna be pretty busy for the next couple days since we have Ron and KJ in in London and we're doing meetings

867
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,740
In fact, I got to get out of here ASAP

868
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,100
For our for our after new meetings in London

869
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:20,020
But yeah, we're getting there dev cast is for the developers who are getting gold and tickets and being brought in

870
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,460
Everyone's gonna get in who signs up for that if you're interested

871
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:30,740
You know you don't even have to if it's just interested in the development of it sign up at devcast.podshow.com and

872
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:35,860
Boy, you are so right. You know, I really do have a feeling that that may be Roger Smalls

873
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:42,100
Is indeed the air traffic controller at fair Oaks that would make a lot of sense wouldn't it

874
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,100
And yesterday

875
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,580
A hold on let me just do one more one more aviation thing because a lot of people had this question

876
00:45:53,860 --> 00:46:03,620
Hey Adam Matthew evil here. I got a question about Wednesdays Charlie, you know the one that you kind of did from the ground and kind of did from midair

877
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:10,500
You know, I deal with spaceship parts up here on the UTF Revolution. I've got myself a

878
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:15,940
PMF drive got a bunch of droids spending machines that need repair that kind of stuff

879
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:23,380
But I don't have any mags up here. I have no idea what mags are you kept talking about

880
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:32,100
Mags what are mags? Are they something that keeps the plane from I don't know flipping over or

881
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,780
Transforming into a robot and I I don't know

882
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,460
Spark plugs those I understand mags not a clue

883
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:44,740
So yeah, could you fill me in on that and by the way if you're ever interested in

884
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:51,380
Flying in something that goes a little bit faster than mock two feel free to join us up here on the revolution

885
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:57,860
By visiting www dot high orbit podcast dot com will be glad to have you any time

886
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,500
Thanks no Matthew

887
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:04,580
End of transmission. Thank you. Yeah, a lot of people asked me that and I realized it wasn't too clear

888
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:08,980
Mags is short for mag needos and they are related to the spark plugs

889
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,340
It's kind of the same as an alternator in your car actually

890
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:17,540
Although we also have an alternator, but that's for different reasons, but just for the concept, okay

891
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,620
You have your battery and you use your battery really only for when your engine isn't running

892
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,140
But when your engine's running

893
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,020
Something's got to create the spark and the spark plugs and

894
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,340
In the aircraft we use mag needos which are gyroscopic devices

895
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:36,180
So they are continuously turning at high revolution and they produce the electricity that produces

896
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:39,780
I'm simplifying it, but they produce the electricity that produces the spark

897
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:44,420
So if you're mag needos and you have two of them for obvious reasons redundancy, but

898
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:50,100
Excuse me one is really for the for the left hand side and one is for the right hand side and I have six cylinders

899
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:53,700
so one of them is responsible for

900
00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:00,740
Actually, I don't know if that's true if they're split up that way we have two of them and if and if one of them isn't working

901
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:08,020
You don't fly because if the mag needos stops working spark is no longer delivered to the spark plugs and you're going to have an engine

902
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:12,500
That's going to not run very well in fact. It could run horribly it could not give you enough power

903
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,060
to stay in the air. It could not give you enough power

904
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:20,500
To get you off the ground and of course the critical part is getting you off the ground because once you're in the air

905
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,860
If the engine quits well, that's a whole different story. You can glide down and find a spot to land

906
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,260
So

907
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:30,180
So that's what you're always checking for. You're making sure these things are okay before you take off

908
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:34,820
And so we were getting what we call a mag drop which means you know the the RPMs drop

909
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,140
Significantly when running just on one

910
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,780
Mag needo. Yeah, I guess so then that's split up then

911
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:45,860
And so that's why we went back and if you have a broken mag, you know, that's a real repair job

912
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:51,620
But the problem was is the spark plug. So one spark plug was it was getting the juice from the mag

913
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:56,820
But it wasn't sparking because it was just completely busted and so that's why the engine was running roughly

914
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:03,620
And it was only basically running on five cylinders instead of six so thanks a Matthew for questioning that and let me clear it up for you

915
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,020
Mag bar

916
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:16,740
Rare celebrity interview Cindy use it magpah.com

917
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,620
You won't want the engine in connection

918
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:28,500
Makes you a con. Makes you a con man. Hey, this is Jay Dolly coming up with the next mad pod

919
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,500
You remember Tommy chong from Cheechen chong

920
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:37,860
Sister Mary elephant coming up mad pod. Hey Tommy. Hello. I is Tommy there. Yeah, it's vegan

921
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,620
Tommy. It's shadow steel. How are you?

922
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:43,620
Hey, good. How are you? I'm good. So are you ready for our interview?

923
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:49,460
Yeah, I'm in the car, but yeah. Tommy is impossible to use marijuana too much

924
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:54,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. You can get too much of anything

925
00:49:55,540 --> 00:50:00,980
You can do too much water, you know, it's called grounding if you use pot. You'll end up like Cheechen chong

926
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,060
Exactly

927
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,060
I mean look at Cheechen

928
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,140
Exactly

929
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,140

931
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,140
Jay Dolly kicking it again

932
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:28,180
We missed a chong. Yeah, excellent. You should listen to that. It's it's a great interview very cool to to hear him on on that show

933
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,780
Kind of a hero of mine. I have to say in a way. Remember we all used to go to the theater

934
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,860
Remember the up and smoke album

935
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:42,740
We've been talking about album covers. That was definitely one of my favorite double albums because you fold it open this double album cover and

936
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:47,140
Inside of it was a huge rolling paper and

937
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:51,300
Just about everybody. I knew bought this thing and our new year's Eve

938
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:57,460
You know, we we all would pool our money and we'd fill this filled this up with herb and smoke it and it was just

939
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:03,460
It was a Cheechen chong joint is what it was. Remember those days and of course they instructed you to clean out

940
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,180
your seeds while using the double album as well

941
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:15,780
But man, you know what I'd like to hear from from listeners and yeah podcasts are listeners too, but

942
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,740
What would you rather have would you rather have five

943
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:26,980
shorter shows during the week or would you be okay with three longer shows or do you want three long shows or we want more short shows

944
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:32,500
Let me know you know I don't know your habits your listening habits. There's no way from me to understand

945
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,340
just from the data that we have

946
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:38,340
What you're what you're into you know, do you use it on your commute?

947
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:43,140
Personally, I think that I mean it wouldn't make much difference in my listenership. I don't think

948
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,340
if I

949
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:51,700
Probably increase if I did three longer shows, but I may be wrong, you know

950
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,340
So what if the show was an hour and a half is that too long?

951
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,700
For me that's often a barrier when I look at the time

952
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,460
Of course, I don't have a commute, right, but I look at the time

953
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:06,340
On a podcast before I play and say, well man, it's quite a commitment. I'm gonna spend an hour and a half listening to this

954
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,780
But of course, you don't have to

955
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:14,340
You can you can turn it off and check in the next time, but give me some feedback on that

956
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:18,420
I'd really like to know what what you're thinking and at the same time I'd like to welcome

957
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:24,900
If I hadn't done that again, I thought I had but I'd like to welcome the Alaska Pod Show to the Pod Show family

958
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:31,220
Adam Curry this is Scott with the Alaska Pod Show. Hey, I want to thank you very much for inviting the Alaska

959
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:36,980
Pod Show into the Pod Show network and it's great to be part of the family. I'm really excited for the things ahead

960
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:41,940
And well, you know, I tried to record this earlier and this is how it went

961
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,140
Adam this has got up here in Alaska

962
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:50,340
I want to thank you for inviting me on the network at the same time. I wanted to share some bearers

963
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:53,860
And I'm witnessing the just waking up after a long winter's nap

964
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,740
This is really

965
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,060
Adam I gotta go

966
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:02,340
They've seen me man. I gotta go. Okay, come back

967
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,220
Get on over to the

968
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,980
And on over the website Alaska Pod Show.com

969
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,620
Get away

970
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:19,780
Is you can see it in turn out like I hope but I want to thank everybody over at Pod Show at the network for making it possible for me to do

971
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:23,220
What I love to do which is podcasting and sharing Alaska with everybody

972
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:27,540
Thanks a lot take care of yourself from Anchorage, Alaska. This is Scott Sloan

973
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,100
Okay, Scott very cool dude. Welcome

974
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:34,900
Was good talking to you on the phone a couple weeks or a go and I'm glad we were able to work everything out

975
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:39,620
That you now part of the family very proud to have you and I can't wait to get back up to a

976
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,820
To Alaska I've been there once I was there for an overnight

977
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,180
I forget the name of the club. It was

978
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,460
It wasn't it I'm pretty sure it was an anchorage

979
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:55,540
And it was just you know this was the the old MTV days when I still also had my countdown show the top 30 hit list

980
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:58,900
Which aired on the radio station on top 40 station there, which I don't recall either

981
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:05,380
But I do remember one thing beautiful women up there just beautiful women unbelievable

982
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,340
maybe you know

983
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:13,300
Maybe my brain is just too fuzzy or maybe I'm too old and I think anything this young is beautiful

984
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,780
But I really recall them as being extremely pretty

985
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:20,260
Now yesterday, yes, we're not even done with the weekend

986
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:27,780
Patricia and I got all duffied up and we hopped on the train from Gilford around was it around noon and

987
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:33,060
Bobbed up to London where Ron was staying in Marta and Chris Jacob

988
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:37,780
He is just coming back from his own vacation, but you know as I said we've got stuff in the city this week

989
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:41,060
We're gonna see if we can get some business going in the UK and

990
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:48,580
The first item on the agenda was to go to the draft and darts at the brick layers arms in

991
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:56,100
W1s that's West London to meet up with a whole bunch of UK podcasters and we've made this purposely very very low key

992
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,900
Whole bunch of people helped out

993
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,900
Neil Dixon Adrian Pegg

994
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:06,980
I mean, there's too many people to mention who contributed to setting this up and choosing the right place and getting it all in order

995
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:10,500
And so we got there a little after three o'clock and they're already at least

996
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:15,940
Man the must have been at least 15 20 people there already we had a nice place the brick layers arms upstairs

997
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:24,900
Although it was very warm very smokey and the Patricia and Marta came with us and and that was cool because I really wanted to

998
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:29,860
They had plans that were gonna go shopping and that they were gonna go to herids and Harvey next, you know

999
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:34,020
By doing all been in New York, baby, and then go back to Harvey next for lunch

1000
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:38,500
Harvey Nichols is the place to go have tea or lunch or whatever

1001
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:43,860
But they stayed for probably a good 30 45 minutes and

1002
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,740
And they had a lot of fun meeting people and Patricia said to me

1003
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:51,700
Private later she said you know everyone had heard everything they knew they said oh, I love that when you did this

1004
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:57,620
I love that when you did that and I said you you don't believe me do you that people love hearing you on the show

1005
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,260
You make the show fantastically when you come on the show

1006
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:06,900
So thank you very much for telling her that because I think that that will motivate her and make her understand

1007
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,940
How important it is to our future

1008
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,900
to come on to the show

1009
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:13,940
And

1010
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:20,180
There were tons of t-shirts and there's pictures all over the place and maybe tonight when I I'm staying in the city tonight

1011
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,180
So my hotel I'll put some of them up online

1012
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,060
There were

1013
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:27,540
People had t-shirts on that said Roger Smalls is the daddy

1014
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:36,100
And I actually I point blank asked a couple people are you Roger Smalls and the answer usually came so

1015
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,300
Quickly and honestly that I'm sure that he indeed was not there

1016
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,700
But it was so cool to put

1017
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,500
Faces to names

1018
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:48,500
To podcasts people had traveled some of them several hundred miles. I'm sorry

1019
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,060
I've got a problem with my left ear. I have a headphone ear

1020
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:54,660
Which is not fun. It's like your ear gets really irritated

1021
00:56:54,980 --> 00:57:00,180
I've had too many headphones on between flying and doing the show. It's had a readjust for a second gets all itchy

1022
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:07,700
Gosh, I don't even know where to start. Okay. Let's start with the beer

1023
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,140
I had a beer in a half and I was like

1024
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:18,180
I think I better stop now. I can't handle it. I can't drink. I'm just I'm I suck at drinking. I'm such a lightweight

1025
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:25,220
And our British colleagues clearly had less less issue with that and it was really fun

1026
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:28,260
It was it was just great

1027
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,740
Hearing everyone. Yeah, it's so funny when

1028
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:37,380
If you've ever met someone who you've seen on television or heard on the radio many many years and if you've been to a podcast and meet up

1029
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,620
You know exactly what I'm talking about but then you hear someone

1030
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:45,540
And you turn around and you go I know that voice because your brain just starts firing and recognizing and

1031
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,620
It was very cool

1032
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:56,740
Very very cool not just from a podcast or a podcast perspective, but to meet up with with Brits who

1033
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:02,820
New about me new somewhat about my life and who I am and could leave all of there

1034
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:08,500
Not not that everyone has that but I think could leave any prejudice or preconceived notions

1035
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:14,980
They may have about Americans kind of you know behind and I was able to ask things about British culture and about

1036
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:20,500
Schools and about that thoughts about what the BBC's doing but also just in general about

1037
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:25,060
Life and newspapers and gossip and and really the culture of

1038
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:31,860
Of the UK and it was very very life enriching for me and the cool thing was of course that after everyone had about three or four drinks

1039
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,940
Everyone's microphone came out

1040
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:41,220
It was like a sex party, you know everyone whips it out and and I did the several different chats with some with some folks

1041
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:44,980
You'll be able to listen that if you got a brickcaster dot com, that's where there's a thread and

1042
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:48,580
Some links to photos and you can see some of the cool t-shirts and

1043
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:53,220
And everyone had a you know a nice sticker badge, you know, hi

1044
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:56,580
I'm so and so in the name of the podcast and I made a lot of friends

1045
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:59,460
I really did and I enjoyed it immensely and I appreciate

1046
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:05,460
Everyone's input and thoughts and we had some very good discussions. I had one even outside

1047
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:11,300
We were all standing around and talking about commercial versus non-commercial and it was it was good

1048
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:16,820
It was good. It was good asked conversation. I'm very appreciative of the the UK podcast and community

1049
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:22,180
And I hope that they can also take to heart what I said earlier in this show is let's make sure that we

1050
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:29,060
Welcome the listeners in as well people who don't want a podcast because I still think that we're

1051
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:32,580
In a very close circle. I don't think anyone can really disagree with that

1052
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:38,420
And I want to get them in more and we have to you know, I'll make it my mission to give the audience better tools to

1053
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:43,300
Communicate back to us which is not necessarily writing something is not necessarily

1054
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:50,020
Recording something there are other ways that you can participate in in in in in a program

1055
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:55,700
I'll make that my mission and and let's try and work on that and we have a great opportunity here

1056
00:59:56,180 --> 01:00:01,220
Really to lead the way in maybe oh, let's hey, let's call it podcasting two point out

1057
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:06,580
No, we won't because the training wheels are are on here too. We've really got to figure out

1058
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:11,140
How to how to do better with that and I had some awesome conversation

1059
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:18,500
With a number of people about second life now if you have not heard this show before

1060
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:21,300
Then you haven't heard my enthusiasm for this

1061
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:24,020
Well, you can call it a game

1062
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:30,180
It would certainly be and they had they do a very smart thing. I think they segregate everyone under 16

1063
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:35,460
Is in a different area so it's really an an adult game

1064
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:43,220
Not necessarily adult because of sexual content, but just adult because it's adults who are in there doing adult things and

1065
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:46,020
and

1066
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:49,780
People this is crack. This is crack for your brain. I'm so in fact

1067
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:55,060
If I could retire right now and all I would do during the day is

1068
01:00:55,700 --> 01:01:02,020
Build my second life and create the world there that I want to create. I would be extremely happy

1069
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:09,700
I would be a very very happy guy and that's how into this I am because this is something about the visualization of

1070
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:16,980
Communication so not just the it's basically it's a chat system, you know, you're chatting with people and you're I aming with people

1071
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:25,060
But you can actually make gestures and give people stuff and invite them places and go places and discover things and learn about other people

1072
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:28,100
And you can tell a lot about a person just looking from the house that he's built there

1073
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:31,540
I got some feedback on it too. Let me

1074
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:34,340
First of all, I was incorrect the other day

1075
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:37,060
When I compared this to

1076
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,100
Neil Stephenson's

1077
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:46,100
Metaverse I incorrectly called the book Metaverse. Hey Adam. This is JC Hutchins given you a shout out from South Florida United States. How's it going?

1078
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,900
In a recent episode of the daily source code

1079
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:54,740
You were talking about a video game called second life and how I reminded you of a Neil Stephenson novel called

1080
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:56,100
Metaverse

1081
01:01:56,100 --> 01:02:01,140
You're absolutely right the video game is a lot like the universe that Stephenson was creating in that book

1082
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:06,820
But the name of this sci-fi classic isn't Metaverse. I'm sorry to say it's snowcrash

1083
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:12,340
The novel is a modern day classic and it's pretty prophetic when you think about online

1084
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:14,500
Communities and how we talk to each other these days

1085
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:19,540
Since you say that you've read snowcrash, I figured hey he might be a science fiction fan

1086
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:24,740
I've written a science fiction podcast novel called seven son book one descent

1087
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:29,620
And since I've got your attention here and God willing the attention of all of your listeners

1088
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:34,260
I'd really appreciate it if you played the new promo for my novel as far as I know

1089
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:37,300
You'll be the first podcast to play it so this will be a world premiere

1090
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:44,580
Thanks, Adam. I really appreciate it keep up the great work keep reading great science fiction novels and check out seven son in your spare time

1091
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:50,500
Okay, I think the I think the promo is coming up right after this. Yeah, it is snowcrash and in fact

1092
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:56,740
I was such a fan of this book and the the lead character in it is a guy called hero

1093
01:02:56,820 --> 01:03:01,300
And it's exactly the same as second life except you you jack into the terminal through a

1094
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:06,900
Virtual reality display the phone is ringing somewhere in the house

1095
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:12,180
So you jack into it by putting on goggles and it's not much different. I think

1096
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:18,020
And also virtual reality glob so if you move your arm then it would move within this virtual world

1097
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:23,380
I was so nuts about it. I actually registered a metaverse dot com which I don't own anymore

1098
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:27,540
I think that that was a part of the is there no one picking up this phone?

1099
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:34,740
I think that was actually a part of the sale when we sold our company the metaverse dot com domain name was a part of it

1100
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:39,060
But we 12 years ago Ron and I had set this thing up not actually I set it up with

1101
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:42,420
Chris Jacob and his brother Carl and

1102
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:48,260
Not long after that, you know when we discovered that there was no way we're gonna ever gonna be able to make money with creating content

1103
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:52,900
And there was a lot of cool stuff we had in there was it was heavily entertainment music base

1104
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:58,900
But all independent stuff and you can still find a lot of that on the way back machine look at just look up

1105
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,900
Metaverse dot com on the way back machine

1106
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,300
which is at archive.org

1107
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,300
and

1108
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,940
You know the second life thing is

1109
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:15,140
It's just it's just like it. It is exactly exactly the book. Let me continue now with this guys promo because I like this feedback

1110
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,900
The President of the United States is dead

1111
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:25,940
He was murdered in the morning sunlight by a four-year old boy

1112
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:36,740
Those are the opening words of 7th son book one dissent the podcast novel written by JC Hutchins and it doesn't let up from there

1115
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:54,340
The man they were cloned from code named John alphas

1116
01:04:55,540 --> 01:05:02,180
David Moldauer critic for the dragon page.com hails 7th son as a taught tense sci-fi thriller

1117
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:08,580
Gary P. Dilly Leeland says I definitely recommend it to anybody out there who's a sci-fi lover

1118

Even Scott Sigler author of earth core and infection says

1119

Right on

1123
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:40,100
It's true the first five minutes does grip you and I'm of I'm becoming a fan of this type of podcast and the

1124
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:45,220
Pottyobooks which I think is a good name too because actually I'm a big fan of audio books people have

1125
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:52,260
listened to the source code for a long time know that I've promoted audio books and I had at one point

1126
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:58,740
I purchased Snowcrash by Neil Stephenson which I think it's it's the unabridged version so it's seven hours

1127
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:05,060
And but mostly it's it's reading and doesn't have the effects in it and stuff and that's what I like about the

1128
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:11,380
Pottyobooks it's taking it one step further somewhere in between the radio drama and the audio book and it's

1129
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:16,500
Exciting and and you could make these productions extremely intricate we're coming out with their own you know

1130
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:22,100
Pottyobooks it's not science fiction, but it's going to well you could deem a science fiction I guess

1131
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:26,340
It's going to be called shadow falls and you should look for that

1132
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:33,620
First or second week of May I believe and and and I think there's we've actually talked about this many times

1133
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:36,980
Yeah, we've forgotten how much we can do with audio we really have

1134
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:42,180
Back the second life because I'm just so jazzed about this, you know, Eric Rice

1135
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:46,820
It's also doing quite a bit and I haven't explored

1136
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:50,740
His area of of second life and haven't

1137
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:56,340
Haven't done any any investigation into it yet, but I know that I guess he bought the the record

1138
01:06:56,340 --> 01:07:04,100
There was a record label that had been created there and he bought that and he set up podcast listening stations and he's he's truly and clearly

1139
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,780
Into this stuff

1140
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:11,540
So I'm gonna see what he's up to here's here's my plan and by the way, I'm really still learning

1141
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:17,300
Okay, now the good news is or for me at least is and and this stuff costs money

1142
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,700
You know this is not free you pay a subscription fee

1143
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:23,860
Particularly if you buy land the larger the land you more the more you got to pay per month

1144
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:27,620
And the business model around this thing is just outrageously smart

1145
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:33,540
But you can also trade amongst each other you can sell things people can give you money

1146
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:35,540
And once you put down your credit card

1147
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:40,260
You know if you want to buy something you don't have enough money is very simple a pops little dialogue box. Oh, you know

1148
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:44,340
You need some more cash you want to buy that and you just go and it automatically you know

1149
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:48,820
You hear the coins drop and then you've got your cash and you can buy something and you can buy anything you want

1150
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,700
And not being a designer

1151
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:54,100
I can when I see how something works

1152
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:59,780
I can edit it and figure it out and and all these objects have scripts and I'm not really a computer programmer

1153
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:06,340
But I can figure out just by reading this it's English mostly I can figure out what the script is doing and I know how to modify stuff

1154
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:12,980
When I'm really taking my time building my second life and and something that really surprised me

1155
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:14,980
You know, yeah people

1156
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:20,180
No my my second life name which is Adam Newman and that's N-E-U-M-A-N

1157
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,500
Newman

1158
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:28,340
They're able to find me instant message me, but they don't really know where

1159
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:34,260
My place is located is I've kind of chosen to remote area and a and a typical dwelling

1160
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:40,740
I'm building a castle essentially why purchase the castle I purchase the land and what I'm doing now is is

1161
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:46,340
You know figuring out what I want to put in my in my world and all of a sudden a couple days ago

1162
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:48,340
There's like a guy in my castle

1163
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:54,260
Hey, Adam this is Jeff Hines with the Friday night dance party podcast

1164
01:08:54,980 --> 01:09:03,620
aka Jeff Cragman your second life stalker. Hey, I was just looking for a prime piece of real estate and

1165
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:08,580
Loan behold I end up on your front door step. What was I supposed to do?

1166
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:13,300
Thanks for the martini, but were you gonna go post it on my ass?

1167
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:19,460
Maybe when I get my castle built you can come on over for Friday night dance party

1168
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:22,580
But until then just listen to the podcast

1169
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:26,980
That's Friday night dance party. Oh, and PS

1170
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:30,260
You're drool when you sleep

1171
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:40,180
I've always wondered about that when I'm logged off and sometimes I guess you're avatar can sometimes hang there or something like that and you don't really go away

1172
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:42,580
Now I figured out how to lock up the castle

1173
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:47,220
That's the good news, but I guess you could still teleport in and you can't I don't know but it doesn't really matter

1174
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:52,500
But here's the plan for me the plan is I want to make this thing completely rocking

1175
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:59,140
I want to set it up so that you know, and I'm gonna have a big ass party at the in and around the castle when I'm ready for you guys

1176
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:05,780
And and hopefully I'll be well enough burst in all of the the cool things that it really will feel like a party

1177
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:11,060
And I know that we can do this if this works this shit really does work. I'm extremely excited

1178
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:15,140
now the conversation I had yesterday with with a number of people including a

1179
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:18,420
Joe twist

1180
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:20,580
Who was a castle's partner and

1181
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:24,820
So she's heavily into podcasting and she's now working for a

1182
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:29,620
I think it's an NGO. It's certainly a non-profit and she's trying to

1183
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:35,700
Really integrate all of these new technologies into well working with a British government actually

1184
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:40,180
And she's doing some I think tremendously important things and you know

1185
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:43,860
She's all over second life as this castle and a lot of people

1186
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:48,740
Either after hearing this show or having heard about it somewhere else have have joined in the fun

1187
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:52,900
Now I have a question for you all because at the end of the day

1188
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:57,220
And I'm gonna be the guy who's gonna say it because I don't care

1189
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:00,740
I say everything apparently on this show at the end of the day

1190
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:05,620
You know you you hook up with someone you talk to him you learn a little bit about second life, but

1191
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:12,740
Isn't it the fact that just about every single person who's on second life at some point or another

1192
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:20,500
Has been hanging out with someone and then you click on the blue ball you jump on it that person clicks on a pinker of blue ball

1193
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,500
They jump on it and you have cyber sex

1194
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:28,340
Come on you got to be honest. I'm I've totally totally it look

1195
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:32,660
There are places where you can go by genitalia you can buy actions

1196
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:37,700
You can buy positions you can buy beds that have all these things built into it a

1197
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:45,060
Big part of what is happening in second life is cyber sex, but it's nothing and I've said before that

1198
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:50,420
I've always paid attention to what this sex and the porn industry has been doing because they're always innovators in

1199
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:52,260
Technology

1200
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:55,380
I've never like the whole webcam thing that's you know

1201
01:11:55,380 --> 01:12:00,820
I don't want to see anyone having cyber sex and I don't want anyone to see me quite honestly

1202
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:06,900
You know, I think there's better porn out there visually, but this is something wow

1203
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:14,500
You know once again wrote we're reminded or I'm reminded that the brain is the most powerful and most active sexual

1204
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:18,980
Oregon anyone has and and this stuff is nuts

1205
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:23,380
It's it's fascinating fascinating

1206
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:31,140
You can have any kind of sex you want anything you can think of and this real people on the other end and and

1207
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:36,020
It's I'm not quite sure how to categorize it. I will do some more investigation for you

1208
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,900
But think about what you can do

1209
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:43,700
You can do an entire

1210
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:46,420
You could do pretty women

1211
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:48,420
There's lots of call girls in second life

1212
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:53,060
You know you might have a fantasy of taking one back to your place and

1213
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,500
And going through the whole movie script and

1214
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:59,780
Either with that person's knowledge or without

1215
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:05,860
You know this is fantasy land that is just it's it's making your brain just scream in overdrive

1216
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:15,300
And is that cheating is that dangerous can someone get hooked and fall in love with someone else just based I mean we have lots of examples of the happening through the internet

1217
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,100
Lots of examples

1218
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:24,420
Again, this is all part of the training wheels this thing. It's like you know for me doing podcasting

1219
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:28,100
I unfortunately I really don't weblog that much anymore

1220
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:32,420
Although I use the infrastructure a lot for the comments et cetera for this show

1221
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:35,060
but

1222
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:41,540
Hopping into second life man. We're we're barely even walking now and the technology is way ahead of us

1223
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:45,460
and the powerful things we can do so I hope to be able to

1224
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:49,140
Explore a lot of that with you

1225
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:53,860
Especially the folks in Britain because you're on my time zone or currently

1226
01:13:54,420 --> 01:14:00,580
Yeah, so it's kind of rough when you log in and everyone's asleep and no one's there because everyone in the states is you know still on one year

1227
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:09,780
But you know, let's experiment I'm getting tired. Can you hear it? Let's experiment together and let's figure out where we can take this place

1228
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:12,980
The cool thing is all the communication

1229
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:18,820
Infrastructure outside of second life if it isn't already integrated into second life

1230
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:26,500
It will be or we can integrate it. You know we can make this this stuff happen we can we can turn it the way we want and I think

1231
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:29,380
That the next time I meet up with a whole bunch of people

1232
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:35,220
I think we'll do it in second life and I'd love to have you over to the castle and I'd love to serve you martinis and

1233
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:40,580
Hope we have some you know some fun things we can do some games and we can listen to stuff together and

1234
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:46,740
Just give me it give me a few weeks to figure all this stuff out and working very diligently and if you've got any

1235
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:51,700
Any tips or anything just you know just look me up you can see if I'm online and

1236
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:55,060
I'm not letting you in the castle yet perhaps because again

1237
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:58,980
I want to make it right now. I want to have my place all set up before I have all my friends over

1238
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:04,180
But looking forward to that. Okay, so what have we done now an hour and 14 and it's holy

1239
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:08,660
Much longer than I had intended

1240
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:15,140
It'll be worth it

1241
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:32,100
Fast with a twist

1242
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:01,380
Only get it while it's hot

1243
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:03,380
Get it a little like that

1244
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:05,380
Yes

1245
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:14,380
Here she comes

1246
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:21,380
She only move but she's not impressed

1247
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:24,380
And that's what she couldn't get less

1248
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:26,380
And a little like that

1249
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:33,380
It's played out as a psychology

1250
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:35,380
It laid out in the gene

1251
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:38,380
I grew up in a lot of little blackheads

1252
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:43,380
She knows it's gonna be

1253
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:46,380
All around

1254
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:49,380
She knows it's gonna be

1255
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:52,380
All around

1256
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:55,380
She knows it's gonna be

1257
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:58,380
All around

1258
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:02,380
When you call your shape a head to toe

1259
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:04,380
The power comes

1260
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:05,380
From what she shows

1261
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:07,380
It'll be my dream

1262
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:19,380
She tried to drive but she couldn't cry

1263
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:22,380
You knew she couldn't make a face in this

1264
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:30,380
She couldn't be

1265
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:32,380
And a little like that

1266
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:34,380
But a hundred percent success

1267
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:36,380
And a little blackhead

1268
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:42,380
She knows it's gonna be

1269
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:45,380
All around

1270
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:47,380
She knows it's gonna be

1271
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:50,380
All around

1272
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:54,380
She knows it's gonna be

1273
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:57,380
All around

1274
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:00,380
When you make a touch of rush it got

1275
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:02,380
But you're gonna come again

1276
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:04,380
While it's hot

1277
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,380
You know you'll back to

1278
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:11,380
You know you'll back to

1279
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:14,380
You know you'll back to

1280
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:16,380
You know you'll back to

1281
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:17,380
You know you'll back to

1282
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:23,380
You'll back to

1283
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:43,780
Nice, cush, little black dress from the Bodhisave Music Network.

1284
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:45,180
Let me just look it up for you for a second.

1285

1290
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:06,900
Incredibly long show, love to hear what you have to say about it, love to hear what you're

1291
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:08,700
thinking about.

1292
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:15,260
Tomorrow, I probably won't be able to do a source code because I'm going into town now, right

1293
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:20,620
after this is uploaded and put up on the podcast, literally network, I'm staying in the hotel,

1294
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:24,820
tomorrow night because we have, or tonight because we have meetings tomorrow morning, starting

1295
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:26,300
at 8 or 8, 30, something like that.

1296
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:32,220
So I do not want to deal with getting up early and, and I actually have never done the,

1297
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:36,020
the morning rush hour commute train or otherwise.

1298
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:39,620
So I don't know if I'm, and yeah, we have the sidelight windows to hit and all that stuff

1299
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:41,420
and we have meetings all day long.

1300
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:46,620
So probably not going to be a show, although I'll see if I can post some progress to

1301
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:47,620
the web logs.

1302
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:50,300
You can follow along with what's happening.

1303
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:54,300
So if not, then I'll gladly see you back here Wednesday.

1304
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:55,300
We'll continue.

1305
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:56,300
We'll have some more fun.

1306
01:19:56,300 --> 01:20:00,300
We'll play some cool tunes and we'll do it all on cast blasts.
