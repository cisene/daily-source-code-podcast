Delta Sierra Charlie 3-9 or 5.

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We don't need no sticky ingredients yet.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Fantastic kids, Adam Curry.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Have the bags and off they go.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Though they might be quite far from home.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The world is their oyster and she is his pearl for sure.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's Patricia and Adam said I'm for another world tour.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
New Yorker's San friend without her just wouldn't be right.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes, she's the real reason for Adam to come home tonight.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But when they're away and they both want to play at the flick of the wrist or a puff on the split,

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
they can find their way around.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Paint their whole town for sure.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's Patricia and Adam said I'm for another fabulous, wonderful,

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
full-of-filled extravagant happy ever after world tour.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We've seen them on TV our whole life.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Super Friends were the woman stones were larger than life.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I can be like anyone I see.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm a record at a bum sleeve.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is everhoo.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Dolls and the mounds of cash never on TV.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We are, we are.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The last summer, the sea, the heroes.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The last summer, the heroes.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Over the 1970s.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The end of the box, it is a doubt tonight.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Rock and roll to make some of the emancipation kiss alive.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You'll see back of me.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
God stars in the dream release.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
London, town, have the hell bent down.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Going to bed in the sweet.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We are, we are.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The last summer, the sea, the heroes.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We are, we are.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The last summer, the sea, the heroes.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The last summer, the heroes.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Over the 1970s.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
See, no one will know.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Way we are, we are, we are more4

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
In the summer, that's all.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
No one left to come.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No one's survival for the 1970s.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The last summer, the sea, and the heroes.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The last Summer, the sea, and the heroes.

53

The last summer, the sea, and the heroes.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The last summer, the sea, and the heroes.

55

We are, we are, the last of the civil heroes, we are, we are, we are, the last of civil heroes, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are,

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hello.

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's only taking us about three days to put together the studio.

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh boy, sorry about that.

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah, I got to watch that. There's something wrong with the process.

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Dad, we're in the kitchen.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes, that's true.

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You can just, you can even hear it a little bit.

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Can't you, you can hear the, you can hear the sink.

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You can hear the sink.

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You can hear the sound of the sink.

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And the garbage disposal.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah, um, no, actually, um,

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
When was the last time we had did a show?

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Was it, uh, it was,

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Cricky.

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Wednesday morning from the private show?

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000

Oh, yeah, no, you know the show.

The show we did for everybody.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Oh, Wednesday, New York.

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah, and today is, uh,

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Was it really Wednesday?

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Was it Thursday?

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Jesus, I don't remember.

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No, no, no, I did.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No, you did.

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Friday show with Charles in, uh, in Monterey.

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah.

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Charles, what's his name?

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Charles, uh, you know, what's his name?

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah.

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So, um, in the meantime, we've traveled a bit.

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Uh, we've been, uh,

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Well, you know, we've been in Monterey.

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
We've been in San Francisco.

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Uh, tomorrow we go home and throughout those past couple of days.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We've actually managed to get a new power supply for the, uh,

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
For the mixer and we got a, um,

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
To the other microphone works and we got you headphones.

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yep.

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
To Patricia to.

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But when I arrived here in San Francisco,

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
My body didn't know where it was.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No, it didn't.

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No, it was like hello.

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Can't.

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh, no, it was not San Francisco.

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No, no, no, no.

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
By the way, I really, I wanted to dedicate the last of the superheroes to, uh,

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
For the first time.

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Because Memorial Day, you know, really is about, um,

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Remembering, uh, fallen soldiers who've defended, uh,

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Our country, who've defended your country by proxy.

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah.

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And it seems like it's really one big sale is what Memorial Day has become.

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes.

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes.

120
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You know, it's just like a go shop day, but.

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And barbecue.

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Well, that's good, too.

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But, you know, just I think people forget barbecue your memories.

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah.

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Very close to the, uh, to the men and women in service.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh, absolutely.

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Especially after my, uh, my tour of Iraq.

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yeah.

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
My, uh, that was.

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Did you hear about the journalists?

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh, yeah.

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's the CBS crew.

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Well, now you're going to see, you know, now you're going to see

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Body's coming home.

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You never see the US service men and women and, and, and, and, and the

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Brits and, well, we saw some Brits coming on, too.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
No, I know we didn't.

138
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You saw them and body bags in.

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Well, yeah.

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
In confidence.

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Well, yeah, confidence.

142
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Really?

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah.

144
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's a big ass deal.

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Mm-hmm.

147
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So now, of course, we're going to see this from the camera crew,

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
which is, it's, it's, it's deserve for everybody.

149
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That is.

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Disaster.

151
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's horrible.

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yeah, it's horrible.

153
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah.

154
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Um, oh, but, of course, we saw, um, just getting back to Michael Butler

155
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and the rock and roll.

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Wow.

157
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You want to, I'm sorry.

Well, it was an, a lovely evening.

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And we saw three bands.

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And, uh, and actually the last one was Michael Butler's.

167
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And I was really surprised.

168
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yeah, it was.

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This band is so good.

170
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And good looking.

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes.

172
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Indeed.

173
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You know, because these days,

174
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I think that, um, a lot of bands, you know,

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
which are really, really good.

176
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah.

177
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I want something to.

178
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And when I, you know, sometimes it's just geeky and very technical.

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Very good.

180
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Very musical.

181
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Not hot, baby.

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Not hot.

183
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So, and, you know, that's a shame.

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And so when I saw Michael Butler's, um,

185
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Ask.

186
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But, but.

187
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Michael Butler's.

188
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yeah.

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And it makes it a singer.

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Everything.

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I mean, they really, they're hot.

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
They're very hot.

193
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What a great band.

194
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We're referring, of course, to the, uh, pod safe rock show,

195
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah.

196
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Which is put on at the red devil.

197
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Jesus.

198
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What is this?

199
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't talk about it.

200
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let it go.

201
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Let it go.

202
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Let it go.

203
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But people are hearing this.

204
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Oh, no.

205
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
No.

206
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I hate when, when.

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I know.

208
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I know.

209
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I know.

210
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But percentage and jokes talk about it.

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Talk about how shitty the sound is.

212
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah.

213
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Okay.

214
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Unfortunately, it's just, but don't say it.

215
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay.

216
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'll try not to.

217
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So this was the, uh, the pod safe rock show with the red devil

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
lounge in San Francisco.

219
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That was Saturday night actually.

220
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah.

221
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah.

222
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And, uh, and we went and, uh, it was freak accident.

223
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The freak accident was up first.

224
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Uh, big mic on drums.

225
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah.

226
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I saw him.

227
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And then, uh, it was griddle.

228
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah.

229
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Who, uh, you like griddle a lot too.

230
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah.

231
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah.

232
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Very much.

233
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And, uh, and then, of course, it was, uh,

234
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
uh, Michael Butler's band, rock and roll.

235
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It was cool.

236
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It was a good show.

237
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Fantastic.

238
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Great evening.

239
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I still wish we had more audience there.

240
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah.

241
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It just, what was that all about it?

242
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Well, it was a lot when we came in, but then, you know,

243
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
uh, American heartbreak didn't go on until what until, uh,

244
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
11, 30 or something like that.

245
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I thought that was too late.

246
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah.

247
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I thought somewhere something that stuff.

248
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But I expected more people.

249
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah.

250
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah.

251
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
For a band like that.

252
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So good.

253
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Do people know for all three bands.

254
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah.

255
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Do people know how good they are?

256
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Well, I think someone does.

257
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
They, they just got a Japanese record deal.

258
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah.

259
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We, oh, this is so cool.

260
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Um, this is Japanese or Chinese.

261
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Who knows?

262
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Something, something Asian.

263
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Something Asian.

264
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So, um, we're listening to, um, uh, rock and roll geek show.

265
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What was it?

266
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
166.

267
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So this is done.

268
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Was it, this was done the day after the show?

269
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I think after the rock show.

270
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah.

271
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And I, I, I actually cut it up on.

272
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I promise we're going to play this for a list.

273
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Listen to Michael Butler here for a second.

274
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
This is funny.

275
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
There you go.

276
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah.

277
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You got the bag's dog house in honor of my status in the household.

278
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It started out.

279
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm, pardon me if I whisper.

280
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I don't want to get in.

281
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah.

282
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Caught, want talking about this.

283
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So the whole show wound on this subject may be me whispering.

284
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So forgive me.

285
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And I apologize if you don't like this kind of talk.

286
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But I am trying to be honest.

287
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
My life is an open book like that.

288
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I've heard Michael Butler do these shows before.

289
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah.

290
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,280
the first time I ever heard him he was it was at a blogger con I think was two years ago

291
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:42,040
and he was in his hotel room all alone drinking beer and recording talking about being all alone

292
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,320
and drinking beer. I love men like that. I said so the day started off fine I went to the

293
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,920
dog park with the wife came with me everything was going great something happened I think I was

294
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,800
I was getting ready to take the kids to have dim sum lunch like we usually do on Saturdays

295
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,480
and about that time the lovely wife decided to start cleaning the house and

296
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,640
somewhere in this is clues as to what it did wrong. Let me listen let me just kind of

297
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:16,440
went downhill and we laughed and went to he went with him to the dim sum he did the dog

298
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,040
what the dog walked you know what they usually do but then she was cleaning the house and then

299
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:26,120
he says he went downhill and now listen now it comes. Okay dim sum and came back and I had to go

300
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,920
mix some acoustic stuff that Billy said I had to go while she was cleaning the house and this

301
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:43,400
was actually a family day I guess she thought you know it was a full family maybe you know

302
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,600
a little bit longer you know what Michael tried to do he tried to do what all guys do

303
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,280
it's like okay I promise the band I'm going to go I was going to go mix this single whatever

304
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,160
so I'm going to do a whole bunch of real family things in the four hours before I have to go

305
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,120
there and that's what I think that's what was going on. Bandroom in Billy's house

306
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,840
because we have a Japanese we got a Japanese record deal coming up I'm not going to say who it's

307
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:14,280
with right now because I don't want to jinx it like it's with Japanese records before like I said

308
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,280
before with the liquor and poker things so I'm going to keep that in my hat who the label is

309
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:24,600
said Japanese label it's not a great deal anyway okay so that's what then then that's what

310
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:32,840
did this you know she is already of course understanding what what he's doing and trying to

311
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:39,480
respect that and now she thought she's going to have a nice day with her husband and the dogs and

312
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:45,080
I don't know what she had the plans and then suddenly he had to do he had to go mix the single

313
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:52,120
Japanese records and she said they will go again it's all about him again something like that

314
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,080
which's pretty good and we're and when you're on a Japanese that he's not talking about any

315
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:02,440
you know yeah yeah it was made later let me fast roll I'm going to drop these flyers off to the

316
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,320
flyer guy and then I'll be home and there's like any drop of the flyers of the flyer guy

317
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,640
so never drop off flyers of the flyer can possibly ask for you know if you're married you know

318
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,760
how this is you know I don't know the only thing worse than being yelled at and punched is

319
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,680
the silent treatment so and going what it's all and not knowing what it's all about his wife

320
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:30,040
punches in oh that's what he said the only worse thing than being yelled at and punched oh my god

321
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:36,120
you hear that and I said that's the silent treatment so and I said so are you mad at me and

322
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:46,200
then all hell broke loose you know how dare me ask on that anyway you have no clue

323
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:54,840
you know when you say sometimes are you mad I said anything wrong based you know oh yeah

324
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,840
and that's not like any clue to us when when when girls go like that no there's nothing wrong nothing

325
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:06,120
at all now them would we're just disappointed that's it you know how I'm really pretending not to

326
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,920
hear that that's happening but it's really pissing me off yeah well why don't you just I don't

327
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:17,000

330
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:34,520
yeah but not today it's very difficult see there's very much better keep a distance okay

331
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,920
see you hear that you hear immediately it overload that is because you're doing it too yeah

332
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,120

333
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:55,480
I will laugh next to my socks no I wanted to I wanted to thank Joe Klein

360
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:10,120
so Ray immediately I'm his fan too but see Ray's got a great rap though because the first of

361
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,160
all he's like oh you know I love I love the Clinton story I love what you're doing you're so much

362
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,680
better than Adam you know you didn't totally he says you know without you the show was just

363
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,800
less good you bring out the best than him but and then later at dinner he's like well you know

364
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,560
I was thinking about buying that forty million dollar house over there yeah he was pointing it out

365
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:35,880
you see that out there I tried to buy that forty million it was a bit too much he said

366
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,800
little bit too much yeah man Ray Lane is on our board of directors he's a partner at the

367
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:48,440
China Perkins and he's been in in the technology industry for a very sensitive man I like that

368
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:54,120
he was a metronome man he is he's a metronome man he is we were actually talking

369
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:00,120
moisturizer for his face oh really oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

370

you know what you do about it he said well I take care of myself as it do you use some some

373
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:28,280
products for your face because a lot of men think they don't need anything but just like leather

374
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:35,320
just like flowers flowers need water and we need some moist on our skin and then that keeps us

00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:48,440
yeah that too that was nice yeah but we can't do that later tonight we can't make a lot of noise

481
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:56,440
because of overload the system oh shit but it was it what it was it's um it's funny because

482
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,040
this is the first time we've really been away from our teenager for an extended period of time

483
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:09,400
together so this is you know 10 days a long time for us and it feels very much like the old

484
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:19,240
exactly yeah when we just before Christina was born well in New York it's 20 years and I

485
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:25,800
have to say I'm still very much in love with you oh baby even though even though Ray would buy

486
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:34,120
you a $40 million house for you to live in he didn't offer that oh okay yeah I love you too yeah

487
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,080
and I'm sorry about the shitty setup I thought I had everything else right now it's always so

488
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:46,360
perfect but it might as well suck once in a while that's life okay so um yeah is there anything else

489
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:53,080
we need to besides the fact that you know I'm confused now because I had things in my mind but

490
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:58,600
because of the whole you know you were a different mood now yeah I mean you want to do the show

491
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:05,080
over and I'll fix it yeah but that's not what our show is all about we just talk to each other

492
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:10,280
you cannot just force it and and do it again that's true you know was there anything you want to

493
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,520
talk about it you can you remember any of that stuff because I feel there was something but

494
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,200
there was something in it I mean who knows you may not maybe able to understand us this is so shitty

495
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,720
oh well look at this and you think about it yeah I had them Simon here from Sam Idol

496
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,280
thanks for all of you letting us know about the American Idol finals being had taken

498
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:42,520
I was wondering why I was getting family hits on a Sam Idol website for people searching for

499
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:49,720
Taylor Idol podcast but now I know so I've gone into you on my podcast with somebody called

500
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,360
Taylor Marley here's a very famous American poet but I hope that there are a lot of people

501
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:59,000
are searching for stuff about somebody in the American Idol called Taylor and they're coming to my

502
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,240
website so that's great and also very very keen to hear that you're um that you're setting up the

526
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,440
ok

527
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:32,440
I've never been the same a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been

528
00:38:32,440 --> 00:39:02,440
a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've never been a kid, I've

529
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,440
So I watch movies in the darkness

530
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,440
In a regular night's peak

531
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,440
And above it all is subterred

532
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,440
There are so tiny dreams

533
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,440
But I don't speak Chinese

534
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,440
So I'll just never understand

535
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,440
Why you don't have any more

536
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,440
And why your boyfriend wants to kill me

537
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,440
Can I watch this film?

538
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,440
And for the morning

539
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,440
Or when I have to come back

540
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,440
So I can't hear me or anything

541
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,440
So I can have a bridge to see

542
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,440
Or not depending

543
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,440
How I explain at the multiplex

544
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,440
And what is playing at the movie

545
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,440
I need a Chinese phrase book

546
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,440
Yo, freak accidents

547
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,440
You like that, didn't you?

548
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,440
Yeah, they were playing that song when we came in

549
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,440
Oh, you know what?

550
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,440
I don't know if this is what everyone else has been listening to

551
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,440
I've been listening to a whole different mix

552
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,440
I'm not kidding you

553
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,440
I hope what I'm hearing now

554
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,440
I hope that's what is what actually was recorded

555
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,440
Because it sounds great

556
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,440
Now I found it and I found the actual mix

557
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,440
I was listening to shit before

558
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,440
So maybe it was just me

559
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,440
Oh, Christ

560
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,440
I'm sorry

561
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,440
No, it doesn't

562
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,440
You know what important it is to be able to hear yourself properly

563
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,440
You know what it is like a singer

564
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,440
As a singer, you know what that's like

565
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,440
You can ruin your whole album

566
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,440
Have you actually ever had that happen?

567
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,440
Has it ruined?

568
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,440
Well, I'm going to go up and produce it

569
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,440
Produces that never got the right sound

570
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,440
And it's on the album

571
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,440
And every time I hear that album

572
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,440
I never listened to my own stuff

573
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,440
You don't even have your own stuff anymore

574
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,440
But might I listen to it

575
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,440
Yeah, should it happen?

576
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,440
Then I think shit, yeah, that was not a good sound voice

577
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,440
Yeah, big gale was the only one

578
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,440
He was the only one who could make the sound

579
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,440
Yeah, that's right because I don't have an easy voice to record

580
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,440
What are you talking about? You have a great voice to record

581
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,440
You're just, no, I've been in the studio

582
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,440
When you when you wanted that sound right

583
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,440
And you're just relentless

584
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,440
He's like, you want the reverb to be a certain way

585
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,440
Folding into the echo, all kinds of stuff like that

586
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,440
You want that sound

587
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,440
Yeah, but your voice is very easy to do

588
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,440
Yeah, but do you like sound of I've made for you now?

589
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

590
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah

591
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,440
Yeah, yeah

592
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,440
Okay, you know what? I'm also tired

593
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,440
You are? Yeah, I'm tired

594
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,440
I hear that for the last couple of days

595
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:14,440
And you know, you're so much younger than I am

596
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,440
And every time I hear you, I'm too dull

597
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,440
You're going to hold on a second

598
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,440
And what am I mean? I'm never tired

599
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,440
What did you do today? You had a wonderful day shopping

600
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,440
Well, Ron and I sat in the office

601
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,440
You said on your house? No, excuse me

602
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,440
It has nothing to do with sitting on your house

603
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,440
We were concentrated, we had three different meetings

604
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,440
People who gave up their memorial day weekend

605
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,440
Like we did like, you know, I would have wanted to go shopping

606
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,440
Or you were moving

607
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,440
But that's nothing to do with it

608
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,440
It's brain power baby

609
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,440
Is that when makes you tired? That makes me very tired

610
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,440
Yes, are you kidding me?

611
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,440
Of course it does

612
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,440
Any brain things to do

613
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,440
You know, you're tired

614
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,440
And you know, remember I took you for walk

615
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,440
Going to peer to

616
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,440
Or whatever it's going to be

617
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,440
I sit on the market

618
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,440
Please come with me because I haven't seen anything

619
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,440
Oh, no, you haven't seen anything

620
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,440
I haven't seen anything

621
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,440
But here in front of the

622
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,440
You know, the view, I see the view

623
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,440
I've taken you around, I showed you

624
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,440
Places, I showed you Greg's place

625
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,440
Showed you what it was like over there

626
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,440
Yeah, we went through Carmel, always we drove

627
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,440
But finally, finally

628
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,440
I saw a little bit more than the spot

629
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,440
Where your flatties were

630
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah

631
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,440
So, I said, let's go and go out

632
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,440
It's beautiful day, let's walk

633
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,440
I was tired

634
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,440
I'm tired again

635
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,440
I was tired

636
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,440
I was tired

637
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,440
Well

638
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,440
How cool is my car, though?

639
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,440
Admitted

640
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,440
Well, it's a smell of French fries

641
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,440
It smells like...

642
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,440
I forget what it was

643
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,440
But you're like...

644
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,440
You and your French fries

645
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,440
Get yourself over here

646
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,440
Yeah

647
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,440
Trinity is awesome

648
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,440
Did that car start on the first go

649
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,440
After two months of sitting in the garage

650
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,440
I was impressed

651
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,440
Thank you

652
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,440
Don't you love my car

653
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,440
What did I say?

654
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,440
No, it looks just as shitty as your airplane did before

655
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,440
Before I redesigned it

656
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah

657
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,440
It's cold, they're a whole thing

658
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

659
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,440
We're going to panper out, we just haven't gotten the whole thing together

660
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,440
Yeah, I hope somebody's going to do something about it

661
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,440
Because

662
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,440
It looks horrible

663
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,440
Yeah, I see everybody looking at me

664
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,440
Oh, poor girl

665
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,440
Poor girl

666
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,440
Yeah, where's their trailer

667
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,440
And did you smile at them just like that without your teeth

668
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,440
Who is my favorite smile?

669
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,440
Exactly

670
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,440
I adjust, by the way

671
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,440
All right, baby

672
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,440
Let's just put this show out and see what people think about the reality of podcasts

673
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,440
Sometimes it just blows chunks

674
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,440
Life is not perfect

675
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,440
This is one thing I got to say

676
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,440
Yeah

677
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,440
Remember those earthlink commercials that everyone hated

678
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,440
Not everyone, but just by everyone hated it

679
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,440
I'll just play it for you

680
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,440
Just to remember what it was

681
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,440
Do you believe anything is possible

682
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,440
We do

683
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,440
We are a flank

684
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,440
So

685
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,440
Just let go into first

686
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,440
I don't know, everything's messed up, I have no idea

687
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,440
Um

688
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,440
He speaks like that

689
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,440
So we got a lot of response and people said, you know, we don't want radio commercials, etc

690
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,440
So now we have earthlink, you know, who's

691
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,440
I'd have to say a pretty forward looking company

692
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,440
Yeah

693
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,440
They, you know, we had meetings with him, we talked about it

694
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,440
We discussed all the feedback that we got from people saying they didn't like

695
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,440
These commercials

696
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,440
Yeah

697
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,440
And they said, okay

698
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,440
Um, we're in, we'll, we'll, we suggest that the ad chat, the ad challenge

00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,440

And it can be a jingle, it can be a commercial

703
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,440
Could just be, you know, someone just telling a story about earthlink

704
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,440
It doesn't matter endorsement, you know, like I have earthlink

705
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,440

What a great idea

714
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,440
Yeah, well, thank you

715
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,440
Well, thank you very much

716
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,440
That's the kind of labor that Ron and I do on Memorial Day weekend

717
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,440
We're sitting in the office, we come up with all the great ideas

718
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,440
Keep the peeps busy

719
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,440
Exactly

720
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,440
We're going to ask you to be on the jury, actually, to be a judge

721
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,440
Okay

722
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,440
Yeah

723
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,440
I was thinking, it's between, it's between you and Peter

724
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,440
Well, because you know that I sang a commercial for years

725
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,440
That's true

726
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,440
Well, you mean, maybe you do the commercial judge

727
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,440
Flops

728
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,440
In between, flops

729
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,440
While the record weren't selling

730
00:46:54,440 --> 00:47:00,440
The commercials, you know, it was, it's very, um, it's very creative for me

731
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,440
And you know what, I was the singer that just walked away

732
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,440
If I didn't go, exactly

733
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,440
Exactly

734
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,440
You know, I think this commercial is shit and socks

735
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,440
I'm not going to do it

736
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,440
You just want to go out of the studio

737
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,440
Yeah, yeah

738
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,440
Yeah, yeah

739
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,440
My dad used to say, if you think that

740
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,440
The things that you have to do like, you know, the backups or a commercial

741
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,440
Is not musical, you know, I don't know if I can translate it

742
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,440
Musical, responsible

743
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,440
Yeah, if it's not, um, if it's not responsible

744
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,440
Musically

745
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,440
Musical, musically

746
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,440
Musically, responsibly

747
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,440
Responsibly

748
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,440
Right

749
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,440
Leave the studio

750
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,440
And as with most commercials

751
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,440
Patricia left the studio

752
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,440
So I would say

753
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,440
They just gentleman Patricia has left the building

754
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,440
Yeah

755
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,440
This is just, you know, shit

756
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,440
It doesn't sound good, it's not, it's not good

757
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,440
It's not correct

758
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,440
Exactly

759
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,440
It's not perfect actually

760
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,440
It's not correct

761
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,440
Because people can be kids

762
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,440
Yeah, I hear so much of that

763
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,440
So, uh, and then I left

764
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,440
So, I, I'm very experienced

765
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,440
I think I did about a hundred

766
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,440
A hundred different commercials

767
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,440
Yeah, but you did

768
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,440
Yeah, I did voiceovers

769
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,440
And that was in between the flops

770
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,440
What did you have?

771
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,440
What do you have hits in between the commercials

772
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,440
To pay my rent, I would do that

773
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,440
Sure

774
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,440
Oh, yeah

775
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,440
I'd still do it

776
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,440
Some chips, crisps, whatever

777
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,440
You didn't call them to genes

778
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,440
Detergents

779
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,440
You did detergents

780
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,440
Yeah, and I did

781
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,440
She got some of the machines

782
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,440
Butter, butter

783
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,440
Do you remember any of them?

784
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,440
The butter

785
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,440
What was the butter?

786
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,440
What was the butter one?

787
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,440
And who's fine?

788
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,440
Who's foreigner?

789
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,440
That's sewing machine

790
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,440
And a motorcycle at the same time

791
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,440
Interesting, you know?

792
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,440
And, you know, like, very, um,

793
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,440
The butter that keeps you, um, lean and mean

794
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,440
Was that they sell?

795
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,440
No

796
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,440
No, Eira

797
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,440
Eira, what was the jingle?

798
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,440
I can't remember

799
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,440
Oh, come on

800
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,440
I don't know

801
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,440
Fun

802
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,440
Oh, and panties

803
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,440
Panties

804
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,440
Panties

805
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,440
Oh, yeah, the legs

806
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,440
The legs one

807
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,440
Yeah

808
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,440
Because we call it strange

809
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,440
But in Holland

810
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,440
Panties is a pente

811
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,440
A pente, but real quick

812
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,440
Right

813
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,440
And you don't remember any of the jingles

814
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,440
Yeah, Pente of Sorbella

815
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,440
And they, they would see me walk

816
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,440
See my legs

817
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,440
Oh, you did the visual commercial

818
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,440
Yeah, and the sound

819
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,440
Yeah, so these

820
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,440
Really?

821
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,440
Yeah, but you don't remember the song

822
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,440
Do you remember how much you got paid?

823
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,440
So, Bella, I don't know

824
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,440
I don't know

825
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,440
Oh, not much

826
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,440
No

827
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,440
