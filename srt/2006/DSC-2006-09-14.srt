00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,040

Exclusively here on that Delta Sierra Charlie 461.

7
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:03,920
Thank you guys and if you leave out of me tomorrow, still I'll always want to see what you want to know.

8
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:13,600
I couldn't take it anymore, just to know that it'd be full and no more.

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,560

11
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,600
It's way, I don't care if it's not too late

12
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,600
I've been no taste thinking of you

13
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,600
It's all the thought you could get through

14
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,600
I fell to you for days and days

15
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,600
I can't hold my knees and die

16
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Oh, I can't take it anymore

17
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Just to know that we've more than no more

18
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

19
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

20
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

21
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

22
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

23
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,600
For South Carolina, very Brit sounding there

24
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
The FireAbs Hey, Kate

25
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
So number 461 of the daily source code

26
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,600
It is just barely Thursday here

27
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
And you got it kingdom in the affluent suburb of Surrey

28
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Everybody, how you doing?

29
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
I'm a little off schedule here

30
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Been in London the past two days

31
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,600
I already hinted at it yesterday with a or was it

32
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
It was more than yesterday

33
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
It was like the day before kind of yesterday

34
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,600
What it doesn't matter if it's in if you live in Australia, it's Saturday

35
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,600
I hinted at it and indeed we announced our partnership with British telecom

36
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Today, which was very exciting

37
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Of course, those of you in listening to the daily source code

38
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Have known about my conversations with the CEO

39
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Talk about my visits there

40
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
And there was no real big secret

41
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,600
But this was really an opportunity for us to introduce

42
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,600
I think yet another way of British audience

43
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,600
To podcasting and to the whole concept of independently produced

44
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Video audio, whether it be music or show or vlog or video podcast or movie

45
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Whatever it is

46
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
And we have really big plans with British telecom

47
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Of course, I'll put a link in the show notes

48
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
The official press release

49
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
It was great

50
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
And I don't know

51
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
I'm woefully unprepared here

52
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Let me see if I might have my notes

53
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Hold on one second, let me just check

54
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
I do have my notes

55
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
What was so cool about this

56
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Is we set it up so that, of course, when British telecom

57
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,600
When they fart, the press shows up, right?

58
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,600
So this was really an opportunity to show the press

59
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:10,600
That what really is possible with serialized independently produced content

60
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,600
I say, I had a list of all the crap

61
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
I'm just organized

62
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,600
I thought I had a list of all the journalists that came

63
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Well, you basically can't think of a publication that didn't show up

64
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Let's put it that way already, lots of postings online

65
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
And so I was going for two days

66
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
I came home today

67
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Really, really, really knackered as we say here

68
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Just due to total lack of sleep

69
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,600
I'll tell you a little bit about the problems we had

70
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,600
And I had the other paper workers still downstairs

71
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,600
And then you know that bio of Ron, bio of myself

72
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,600
The press release and a bio of Gavin Patterson

73
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Gavin is the

74
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
BT consumer managing director

75
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,600
He's really in charge of all the everything that goes to consumer's homes

76
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Including the forthcoming BT vision

77
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,600
Which is their IPTV project

78
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,600
So it's a broadband falls under his jurisdiction

79
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Shall we say?

80
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
And the first thing Patricia says, man

81
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
And she's getting ready for bed

82
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
So we'll have to talk about it on maybe Friday's show

83
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
First thing she says, well, he's kind of cute

84
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,600
I have to say Gavin's not a bad looking guy

85
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,600
I have a feeling that he's younger than I am actually

86
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
But it was awesome

87
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,600
He had three monstrous plasma screens

88
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
And I used visual communicator

89
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,600
That's the software I used for my video show

90
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
There's a live mode

91
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
And it really, really worked well

92
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Good questions from the press

93
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
I have to say that we were still

94
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,600
Actually the event was being held at the

95
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Sanderson Hotel, which is one of those

96
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
What is it?

97
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
You know, way too hip

98
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Is it an inshregor

99
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
I think who did that hotel

100
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
You know, basically they get old

101
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Ugly furniture

102
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
And then throw a sheet over it

103
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
And then it's cool

104
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Well, this hotel

105
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,600
I might add not provision by BT broadband

106
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Actually by easy net

107
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Because believe me, I was all over the network

108
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Tracing and looking for stuff

109
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,600
It was driving us up the freaking wall

110
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
All last night

111
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
And I was on this till about 2am

112
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Really nice admin who of course

113
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,600
Has a lot more on his plate than dealing with the Wi-Fi

114
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
Throughout the hotel

115
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,600
And he got a hub and a hard-wired connection

116
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Well, the problem stem from a couple of things

117
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,600
The main one is it appears that there are some hotel personnel

118
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Who had little bit torrent servers running

119
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
So he would cut him off

120
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
They'd turn him back on

121
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Then he started and they had to block the IP addresses

122
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,600
At one point he actually turned off all Wi-Fi access

123
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,600
And the entire building just so he could say that they actually

124
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Could provide connectivity to the outside world

125
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
But it was horrendous

126
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
His whole hotel was interesting

127
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
But you got to be careful

128
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,600
You have rooms with no walls

129
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
Yeah, their walls are made of glass

130
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
And it was after I almost

131
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Seriously injured myself three times before I figured out

132
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
This little button you push

133
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
And then a curtain opens up

134
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
In front of the glass

135
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
So you don't do exactly what I was doing

136
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
I didn't see much of the room anyway

137
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Something else I learned

138
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Windows has a very interesting default setting

139
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
If you have a virtual private network

140
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
By default

141
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
It will always route all of your traffic

142
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Through your virtual private network

143
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
And that's the default setting

144
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Now if you never use the virtual private network

145
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Then it doesn't really even matter

146
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
I mean actually

147
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
When you think about it this is totally

148
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Tenfold

149
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Tenfold

150
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Tenfold

151
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Tenfold

152
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Tenfold

153
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Tenfold

154
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
Tenfold

155
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Tenfold

156
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
And now it's tenfold

157
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
The tenfold

158
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
You'll have

159
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Moment

160
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Big wind up

161
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Sorry

162
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Yeah

163
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
So the tenfold I'll have moment

164
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Is that the virtual private network

165
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Which you can set up in Windows

166
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
Which of course I have with the pod show office at San Francisco

167
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
And there's another default setting

168
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
It will automatically redial if the connection is broken

169
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
And so I really learned about this

170
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
When this connectivity

171
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Tho tell, kept crapping out

172
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,600
And then I'll kept popping the connect to the VPN

173
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Connect to the VPN

174
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
And the virtual private network

175
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,600
And so now I understand that

176
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Why my mic

177
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
I set up this VPN

178
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
I don't know a couple weeks ago

179
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,600
And I thought my bandwidth sometimes was really weird

180
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,600
And the reason why if you just kind of imagine your head

181
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
I'm connecting to the internet

182
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
From Gilford

183
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,600
That connection is actually going through the internet

184
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
All the way to San Francisco

185
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
And then my computer for all

186
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Technical

187
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
From all technical aspects

188
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Believes it's actually connected to the secure private network

189
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
And San Francisco

190
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,600
And then it goes out and then gets my request from the network

191
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,600
So obviously this traffic is going around the globe

192
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Several different times

193
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
The wonder was a little bit slow

194
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,600
So Andrew Grummit got on Skype with me

195
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
And he walked me through how to get rid of it

196
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,600
At one point I was so frustrated with all the connectivity problems

197
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
At the hotel

198
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
It's okay

199
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Let's just get rid of the virtual private network

200
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
That's really easy by the way

201
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Right-click delete

202
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
Problem solved

203
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
To the phone

204
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
To the phone

205
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
To the phone

206
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
At moment

207
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Yeah

208
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
So anyway

209
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Go to btpodgeow.com

210
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
If you live in the UK

211
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
And you want to get you should out there

212
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,600
We've lunch with that today

213
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
And we'll be rolling out

214
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Well we'll be rolling out of course a full-blown system

215
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Obviously targeted towards the UK market

216
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,600
But obviously integrated with the existing podshow plus system

217
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
And there are changes coming there as well

218
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
So a lot going on

219
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
As I said, a little bit knackered

220
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
But very, very satisfied

221
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
It's been a great couple of days

222
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
I'm going back tomorrow

223
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
We actually have a board of directors meeting

224
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Since Ron is here and Chris is here and Aaron is here

225
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
We're going to hop on a video conference

226
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
And do that tomorrow at 5 p.m.

227
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Watch out, scruncher alert

228
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Adam, I don't have much time

229
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Here in the voices you've planted in my head

230
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,600
I'm sitting here in the nunch room

231
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
At work and next door to me

232
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,600
I hear the unraveling of many roles of paper

233
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,600
And one word comes to my mind, scruncher

234
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,600
All this time I've never understood that but now I do

235
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
What I know

236
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
I don't think so

237
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Forever I am a folder

238
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Interesting, you know, I just realize now

239
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,600
That I never asked Gavin Patterson from British telecom

240
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
If he's a folder or scruncher

241
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
I think he's a scruncher

242
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,600
I don't know, I'll have to ask him

243
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
I think he might be a scruncher

244
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
I think a lot of telco guys are scruncher

245
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
It's beacon of podshow plus

246
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Hi Adam, this is Martin from Reading

247
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Long time daily source code list

248
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Now I suppose you could call me a hundred

249
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Because I can't actually remember the time

250
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,600
When I first started listening or how I do

251
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
I found out about you

252
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
So anyway

253
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
A cool idea

254
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
I've been playing around with podshow

255
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Yeah, you found out about me

256
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Didn't you read it on Craigslist?

257
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Under escort services

258
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
There's no doubt loads of other people have

259
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
And I noticed on this view you can build your own channels

260
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Which result in getting feeds

261
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Which you can also see in iTunes

262
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Well I've got a nice neat rocky sound bridge

263
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Sitting on my side border home

264
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
And I thought it would be really cool to be able to play

265
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
In my channels using the sound bridge

266
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Now I think actually thinking about this

267
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Probably possible using iTunes

268
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
And a bit of cludging and this and that

269
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
But actually it would be really cool to be able to do that

270
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Just by using the streaming radio function that it has

271
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
So there's one for your

272
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Clip that people to think about

273
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
So there you go

274
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Oh yeah

275
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Scruncher

276
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
But I did try folding

277
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,600
I just can't go the time

278
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
It's just part of your complicated

279
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Sorry

280
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
To complicate today

281
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
I don't know

282
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
I'm not familiar with the soundboard product

283
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
But is it one of those

284
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
It's just like something that you connect to

285
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
To your network and then it can receive

286
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Streaming radio channels

287
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
If so

288
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
I believe

289
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,600
The smart people at Podshow have already thought of that

290
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
You'll see next to every podcast

291
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Every show

292
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
Every channel

293
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,600
The same place where you've found you

294
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
When you go to play your channel

295
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
You have a little advanced options there

296
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
And you can choose iTunes

297
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
You can choose the raw XML

298
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
But you can also choose Windows media player

299
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Or real player

300
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
And I'm pretty sure that

301
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
From what I'm hearing you say

302
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
The soundboard probably should understand

303
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
How to accept

304
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
What is it?

305
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
An M3U or a file

306
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
I think that's what it is

307
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
The real player

308
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Can access

309
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
So try that

310
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Try copying the link

311
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,600
That is under the real player

312
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
icon

313
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
Or it's selected as the downloader

314
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
For your channel

315
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,600
And I think that link will actually just work

316
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,600
You could also try the Windows media link

317
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Because in essence, although the protocol is not really streaming

318
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,600
It will bring in the MP3s in a streaming progressive fashion

319
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
And play them as soon as they can

320
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
So give that a try

321
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Let me know if not to send me some details on the soundboard

322
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Or whatever the heck is you're talking about

323
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
And I'll see if we can figure out

324
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
Because yeah, I love stuff like that

325
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
I have to take it back by the way

326
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
What I remember I was talking about the Nokia

327
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
And the N61

328
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
That Nokia gave me to try out

329
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,600
I still won't use it as a phone

330
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,600
But wow, this is a fantastic podcast listening device

331
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,600
I really have been deprived

332
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
And I've had this thing in my bag all this time

333
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,600
I was using it as a setting up for a demo

334
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
For British Telecom

335
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Earlier, there was a Friday

336
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,600
And it has Wi-Fi built in

337
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,600
And GPRS, so what is that?

338
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Two and a half generation

339
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
It's not quite 3G yet

340
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,600
But it's basically fast enough to bring in

341
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Smaller podcast and reasonable amount of time

342
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,600
And I've subscribed to my daily news channel

343
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,600
And I have, you know, like the New York Times front page

344
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
And it also do video by the way

345
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Quite happily it'll do MP4

346
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Not a problem

347
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,600
And it's great because the biggest problem with the iPod

348
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Always, you know, it's got to be charged

349
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,600
iTunes has to have everything downloaded

350
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
You have to have connected to it has to be synced up

351
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,600
So either you have a religious habit of plugging that in

352
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Every single night

353
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,600
With this thing is like, oh, you know, I'm in the car right now

354
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Or I'm on the train

355
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Let me just check my channel, you know

356
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
And you can set it up so it automatically connects

357
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
And keep your channel current

358
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Or you can do it right there on the fly

359
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
Plug in the headphones

360
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Or even through the speakerphone

361
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Actually quite a nice device

362
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Not being paid to say this by the way

363
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Just for the run

364
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
All right, let me guess

365
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,600
You're talking about BT

366
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Of course it has the address been going on

367
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Same things like that

368
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
But then those sort of home broadband

369
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Here we got what is fairly eventually built

370
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
TTTV

371
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,600
And I think that's what you're doing

372
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
British telecom

373
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
Or I don't know BT over the world

374
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Whatever it is

375
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,600
But I'm not saying

376
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
You've revenge on me

377
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
These are the, I think it's that

378
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
Well, I'll find out

379
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
But if not, it's never was right

380
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Anyway, that's very significant

381
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
And

382
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
That's very significant

383
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Yeah, BT vision is what they're going to do

384
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
I think the end of this year or fourth quarter

385
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Or whatever, which is going to be

386
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Television

387
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
I think what it is

388
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Now I haven't actually seen one of these boxes

389
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,600
But there's something in the UK called free view

390
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Which is amazingly popular

391
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,600
And what free view does

392
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Is it takes regular television signals

393
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Just out of the air, out of the ether

394
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
And

395
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
And recognize that it's digital

396
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
And coded signals that are traveling over that

397
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Over the air signal

398
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
And you get like 30 channels right off the bat

399
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
All digital, super quality

400
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,600
And then of course if you plug this thing into

401
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Your broadband connection into your phone

402
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Socket

403
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Why then you're going to get all kinds of groovy stuff

404
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
And it'll be connected up to your television

405
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,600
I think it's also going to have a

406
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,600
PVR personal video recorder built in

407
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,600
It's going to be an interesting

408
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,600
And I think very fun content device

409
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Let me see what we have here

410
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,600
Seven minutes left

411
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Okay, you know what?

412
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
If you want to call in, leave a message

413
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,600
Or if you want to call in, leave a new phone

414
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Jingle

415
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Call the DSC

416
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
In the USA

417
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
That's plus one

418
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
201

419
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,600
6256357

420
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
That's plus one

421
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
201

422
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
6256357

423
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
In England

424
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
The UK

425
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
It's plus four four

426
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
207

427
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
681

428
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
3753

429
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
That's plus four four

430
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
207

431
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
681

432
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
3753

433
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
If you're a scruncher, a folder

434
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
To fingers or a holder call now

435
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
That's still cracks me up

436
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,600
If you're a scruncher, a folder to fingers or a holder

437
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Sales Weasel Greg at Pod Show HQ

438
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,600
Sent me a very cool interview with Leo Leport

439
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
From what is this ad age

440
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Which is an advertising industry publication

441
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
With Leo Leport of TWIT

442
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
This week in tech

443
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,600
And it's actually it's fantastic podcasting

444
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Because I haven't seen it on any of the podcasting news sites yet

445
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,600
I think it's probably because it's, you know, it's really

446
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
It is an industry publication

447
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
I'll just read a couple of bits from it

448
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,600
Leo Leport didn't expect to become one of the largest independent podcast

449
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
20 began recording as conversations

450
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
With former tech TV

451
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Tech News Guru with former

452
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
The hell is that?

453
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
It doesn't need, it's not even a fucking sentence

454
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Tech News Guru, Leo Leport is launching a podcast advertising network

455
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Tech News Guru, Leo Leport is launching

456
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
What is this?

457
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Why is this copied five times?

458
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Anyway

459
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,600
In conjunction with was it pod track

460
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,600
This week in tech is now running ads

461
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
And as you know, I've been in the city

462
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
So I haven't heard the most recent episode

463
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Or actually the last three episodes

464
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
So I didn't pick up out of myself

465
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,600
But

466
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,600
They're now running ads for Dell

467
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Team Mobile

468
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
And Visa

469
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,600
I had a couple of other things here

470
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Adage says

471
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
What's adage digital?

472
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
So maybe it is online

473
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
So now you ask people to donate

474
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Like a paid subscription

475
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
And you're taking advertising

476
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Is this kind of like a magazine model

477
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Interesting question actually

478
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
I thought it was compelling

479
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Mr. Leport says

480
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
We're very much like a magazine model

481
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Where the paper and shipping will be paid for by subscriptions

482
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,600
And ads paid the staff and help you make a profit

483
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Unlike broadcasting

484
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Every additional person cost us money

485
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Because of added bandwidth costs

486
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Which is also very much like a magazine

487
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
You do want growth

488
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
But you have to think about what it's going to cost

489
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
You actually

490
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
With more like public radio

491
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
Where your listeners are your supporters

492
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
But you have corporate donors

493
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,600
Who donate things like bandwidth

494
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
And also advertisers or sponsors

495
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
That is not like public radio

496
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
I think someone wrote that down

497
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
Kind of wrong

498
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
We're doing it on time here

499
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
I want to make sure I hit the satellite window

500
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
Just right

501
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Adage says

502
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
How is your audience?

503
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Now this is really interesting to me

504
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Because just reading through this whole article

505
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,600
I see that Leo is answering questions

506
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,600
That were

507
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
The way we were answering

508
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
Probably a year ago

509
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Which is great

510
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,600
Because I think that we definitely

511
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Were early or right on time

512
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,600
With really the full-blown advertising model

513
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
And not just like an ad sense

514
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
And certain commercials in the podcast

515
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
But really having the host involved

516
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,600
And turning advertising into content

517
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
So Adage says

518
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
How has your audience received the advertising

519
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
Mr. Leport says

520
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
Well, there's some pushback from audience

521
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,600
Which includes a lot of tech enthusiasts

522
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
A certain percent of them think we should be doing it for free

523
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
But we're not the free software movement

524
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,600
We're trying to create a product

525
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,600
I'm an old radio guy

526
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
And like the old fashion radio model

527
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,600
With the host doing the ad live in the program

528
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,600
Like Paul Harvey Charles Osculade

529
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
It's folksy less intrusive

530
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Gives advertising great benefit

531
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
Gives advertisers great benefit

532
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Because it's an endorsement

533
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
It's us saying we like Dell

534
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
And it doesn't feel like an ad

535
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
It carries more weight

536
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
Americans kind of get it

537
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
Because they've heard Paul Harvey

538
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,600
I don't think Paul Harvey is the best example anymore

539
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,600
Okay

540
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
But it is true

541
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
You know I like the endorsements

542
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
I like talking about products in the show

543
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
I love it

544
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,600
I think it's perfect

545
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,600
But that did catch my eye

546
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,600
You know I'm a big fan of

547
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,600
The BBC automobile magazine show

548
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Called Top Gear

549
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
In fact Jeremy Clarkson

550
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
The guy who

551
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
Well he's co-host

552
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
But he's kind of like the main host

553
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,600
And I don't know how much of the production he does

554
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
Or how much how involved he is in that

555
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,600
But he is definitely a god here in the UK

556
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
When it comes to

557
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Well many things particularly

558
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Automobiles but other manly stuff as well

559
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,600
That's kind of his whole image

560
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,600
And Top Gear runs in the BBC

561
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,600
Which means there's no commercials

562
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
And because there's no commercials

563
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,600
There's no car manufacturers advertising

564
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
So they can really there's no benefit

565
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
To them saying you know one car

566
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Is better than the other or as they often do

567
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,600
On top gear saying the one car

568
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,600
You know really does suck compared to the rest

569
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
In fact this show is so good

570
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
And so well produced

571
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
And I'm sure it's very expensive

572
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,600
To produce

573
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Because they do a lot of really really nice

574
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Produce packages

575
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,600
And they really showcase these automobiles

576
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
And all kinds of

577
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Very innovative and creative ways

578
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,600
It even won an Emmy award

579
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,600
This is how good this British auto show

580
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
One and Emmy award

581
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
But of course again

582
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Because there's no advertisers

583
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,600
There's no automobile manufacturers

584
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,600
Who are advertising

585
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Which is really what makes most

586
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Programs if you look at the car market

587
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
When there's a show about cars

588
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
You know they usually suck

589
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,600
Because you know they're not going to slam a car

590
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Because then the advertising pulls out

591
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Now with this week in tech

592
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,600
I think it's interesting

593
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,600
That they would accept a commercial for Dell

594
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
Because you know

595
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,600
And this is just after the laptop batteries

596
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
We're exploding you know

597
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
Which of course was bad for Sony

598
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
Who created the batteries

599
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,600
But you know if something else happens in the future

600
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,600
Will they risk losing that sponsorship

601
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,600
You know I'm all for advertising

602
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
I'm totally for it

603
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,600
I think advertising is content

604
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,600
With content changing and with distribution

605
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,600
Changing

606
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Advertising has to change along with it

607
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
But I am very very wary of

608
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,600
And I think I love the advertising

609
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
Visa, fantastic, Timo will

610
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,600
You know when you're talking about tech

611
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
And these guys really do talk about tech

612
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
I think that there could be a conflict

613
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
So that caught my eye

614
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,600
And then I was reading through this article

615
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
Just a second

616
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
I just got to say goodbye to everybody on serious

617
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
I'll talk to you guys

618
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
Was it tomorrow for Fubar Friday

619
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
Oh man they're going to miss some good stuff

620
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,600
As I was reading through this article

621
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
I was like wait a minute

622
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
And I went to

623
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,600
PortableMediaExpo.com

624
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
I think it is which is for the podcast

625
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
Expo coming up

626
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Oh crap

627
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
That's very soon isn't it?

628
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,600
Um

629
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,600
He has at the end of this month

630
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,600
It's like weeks away if not days away

631
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,600
Which I really don't think I can attend

632
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
Just because of logistics

633
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
I really didn't know if I wanted to go

634
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
And all

635
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,600
But legal report is doing the keynote

636
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Again this year

637
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,600
Now I remember last year

638
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
I was asked what it was doing

639
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
A whole

640
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,600
Conversation

641
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
And all kinds of back and forth

642
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
About Ron or I

643
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Doing a keynote

644
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,600
And what the set-up kind of was

645
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Which I didn't like too much

646
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,600
And actually Jason Calcannis

647
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
Calcannis

648
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
Filmed in

649
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
It was kind of having two keynote

650
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,600
You had the alter commercial keynote

651
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,600
Which I believe was what my job was supposed to be

652
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Which I really just didn't

653
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
Whole bunch of reason I didn't want to do that

654
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
That's you know that's a year ago

655
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
I don't care

656
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
And then Leo Leport was going to be kind of like

657
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
The balance for that and talk about

658
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Non-commercialism

659
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
And really about

660
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
The passion of podcasting

661
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,600
And so they did do this

662
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
They did have Jason Calcannis

663
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
Start off first last year

664
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
The keynote

665
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,600
And then Leo Leport

666
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
And thank God for the internet

667
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
Because I went back

668
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
And I was able to find

669
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Not just the audio of the keynote

670
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
But also video

671
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,600
And the video doesn't have

672
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
Great audio of course

673
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
So technically I was just

674
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,600
String the two together

675
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
But the video was very nice

676
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Because he had some funny slides

677
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
And it was a very funny

678
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
Very funny speech

679
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Patricia walked

680
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,600
And while I was listening to it

681
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
On the couch earlier

682
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
The seedings

683
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
Oh he has a very nice voice

684
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
It's been a radio for 30 years

685
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
But I pulled a couple of

686
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
A couple of pieces from the keynote

687
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,600
It's just really really interesting

688
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
Listen on

689
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
I'm meeting people that I've been listening to

690
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
For a year and more

691
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
And it's just so cool

692
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
For us to get together like this

693
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
It's really exciting

694
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,600
And I'm really glad to see what Jason said

695
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
Because as talent

696
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
We win the game

697
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
Isn't that nice

698
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,600
So I'm not going to talk about the business model

699
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
I have no interest in the business model

700
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,600
Oops

701
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
Here it comes

702
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
People ask me all the time

703
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,600
What's your business model for

704
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
Twit and I refer him to the Vorac

705
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,600
The Vorac said podcasting was

706
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
Bunk and then he's got on Twit

707
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
And he said I love podcasting

708
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
It's the next big thing

709
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,600
And I asked him how we're going to make money

710
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
And he says you don't have to worry about that

711
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,600
Business model will appear

712
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,600
Fine with me

713
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Because you know the truth

714
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
And the truth is

715
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,600
And what I'm here to tell you really

716
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,600
Is that don't worry about the business model

717
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,600
I'm only going to have 25 minutes

718
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
So I'm going to move pretty quickly

719
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
Here through this

720
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,600
But I know you came

721
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
If you came here as a podcast

722
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Or you came to find out

723
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
How do you make a successful podcast

724
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
And successful means different things

725
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,600
To different people

726
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
If you're Jason

727
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
Maybe it means making 25 million

728
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Dollars

729
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
To me it means making a great podcast

730
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
That people listen to

731
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
And I'm not going to worry about the money

732
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Now Howard's got his pay day

733
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
I am

734
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
I just cut a whole bunch of pieces together

735
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,600
So he says he's not going to worry about the money

736
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,600
And maybe this was

737
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
Because he didn't quite understand

738
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
And for those of you who've been listening

739
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,600
For over a year

740
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,600
We talked about bandwidth so much

741
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,600
I could not

742
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Almost an episode didn't go

743
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
Past me why I didn't say

744
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,600
We've got to be so careful

745
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
Because success can mean instant failure

746
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Because of the bandwidth cost

747
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
And at this point I don't think Leo

748
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
And I had spoken to Leo

749
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,600
I tried to get Leo signed a pod show

750
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,600
At the time

751
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
I really did

752
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
I still love to have him on the pod show

753
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,600
Network

754
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
But I know it's very

755
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
Very tricky

756
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
Because indeed

757
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Just like his magazine

758
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
Metaphor which is not bad

759
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
You know the more

760
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
The bigger your audience is

761
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
The more it cost you

762
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
Which is really why streaming failed

763
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,600
When Dan with Cots were just much much higher

764
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,600
In the late 90s

765
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
So what he did then

766
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Is he played a piece of Howard Stern

767
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Ragan on pod casting

768
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
And then he gets back

769
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,600
And he really

770
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,600
For someone didn't want to talk about money

771
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
And his keynote talked about money quite a lot

772
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,600
Jason said he's got his half billion

773
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,600
So he's not threatened by pod casting

774
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
I would submit

775
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
That if Howard were getting into Brady

776
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Right now he would be much happier in pod casting

777
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
In fact that's what that diet tried

778
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
Was all about

779
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,600
Was how restricted he'd been

780
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
How excited he was to go to serious

781
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Because he'd have no restrictions

782
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Howard you're going to have restrictions

783
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Somebody pays you half a billion

784
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
Dollars they have expectations

785
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
Trust me

786
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
And I don't think it stops

787
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
With half a billion

788
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
By the way

789
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,600
I think if someone pays you

790
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Any amount of money they have expectations

791
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,600
Absolutely

792
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
This gets back to my top gear example

793
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,600
If you're doing a movie pod cast

794
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,600
I think taking advertisement

795
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,600
If you're doing a critique of movies

796
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Let's put it that way

797
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
I think that

798
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Taking advertisement from movie companies

799
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Mind being a mistake

800
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
Yeah

801
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
I do the daily source code

802
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,600
This is all about stupid stuff

803
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
I don't see any advertiser

804
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Would be a conflict on this show

805
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
Take the money

806
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
Be on you

807
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,600
I don't care what

808
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
They own you

809
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
Howard really

810
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
If he didn't want all that money

811
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
And I can understand why he might

812
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,600
But Howard would be happier pod casting

813
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,600
That's what's the beauty of pod casting

814
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
Nobody tells you what to do

815
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
And I would submit

816
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
You know we're talking a lot about business models

817
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
That's what this whole session is

818
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
All after this

819
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
How to make money

820
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,600
You keep in mind as a pod cast

821
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,600
If somebody gives you money

822
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
You owe them something

823
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,600
D-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-Eeeeeeeee!!

824
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,600
And I think the joy of pod casting for me

825
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,600
And I think maybe for some of you

826
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,600
Is we don't want to owe anybody anything

827
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
We want to do what we love

828
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,600
We only owe our listener

829
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,600
An experience

830
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,600
Now I listened to the listeners

831
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,600
But I don't want to have to listen to advertisers

832
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,600
Cause they haven't

833
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:53,320
So Leo, I just wanted to point out that you might want to touch on this because a lot

834
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,400
of stuff has changed when you do your keynote this year at the Portable Media Expo.

835
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,680
I think you definitely should talk to people about why you change your direction here.

836
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:10,400
And I understand why, but as I told you a year ago, we saw that this would be an issue.

837
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,200
And so I'm glad you're solving it, definitely, different interests.

838
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
Don't you think?

839
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
Yeah.

840
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,520
The listeners will tell you what you want.

841
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,680
So we've already said on Twitter, we'll never take advertising.

842
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,280
Oh, let's just listen to that again.

843
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,920
Advertisers, because they have a different interest.

844
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,400
Don't you think?

845
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,880
The listeners will tell you what you want.

846
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,640
So we've already said on Twitter, we'll never take advertising.

847
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,360
The lesson here is never say never, my friends, which is crazy because when I hear Jason say

848
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,960
that the Engagit podcast making them a couple hundred thousand a year, I'm done on cheese.

849
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,560
What have I done?

850
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,960
Right.

851
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,000
Now, there's something else that our listeners want.

852
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,840
Before we do this, I just, I threw this in last night because I just got some stats.

853
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,240
There's a company called pod track that is, I think a pretty good idea.

854
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,960
If you're looking for advertising, their idea is, and I've talked to Mark McCree a few times.

855
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,800
Maybe some of you have.

856
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,360
I know one of the things he did right was talk to podcasters.

857
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,600
They're going to match podcasters with advertisers.

858
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,880
Again, I'm okay.

859
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,160
So I definitely would like to hear more about that.

860
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,600
I think if you're, and pod track, some would say, oh, you know, they're competitive.

861
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,800
I don't think so.

862
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,400
The space is so incredibly huge.

863
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,840
There's so much advertising, so much independently produced content.

864
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,880
We need, we need lots of other companies doing this.

865
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,000
But I don't think a match of delcomputer to this week in tech is a good idea.

866
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,840
I just don't.

867
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,880
And I think you can see very easily why that doesn't seem like a good match.

868
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,120
I think VC might be a very good match.

869
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:48,880
Chute, you know, well, at least guys do talk about a lot, you know, I guess it all

870
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,280
comes down to the execution.

871
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,880
You know, when we get paid to talk about the little man movie, I told you, I hadn't seen

872
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,880
the fricking movie.

873
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:01,920
I didn't see the movie, my ad consisted of, you know, like four different times

874
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,840
me telling you, I hadn't seen the movie yet.

875
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,080
That to me is content, that's, it's commercial content.

876
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,240
But it's different than the advertising.

877
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,720
I think that the Twitter is doing.

878
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,040
But one of the things they have is a free survey that you can give your listeners.

879
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,520
So I put this up on the Twitter site on Tuesday.

880
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,560
We got about three or four thousand responses.

881
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,320
So I thought I'd share some of these with you.

882
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,720
First of all, this is the age demographic, and you can see the majority.

883
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,840
The only I did about 30 minutes.

884
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,400
So this is just like a 20% of the entire community.

885
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,520
Our 25, 34.

886
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:40,240
This is actually about what you'd expect with a big chunk, 35 to 44.

887
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,520
And there's five, 75 year olds listening.

888
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,080
I got a little nervous when Jason started talking, because as soon as money gets in

889
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,440
the equation, it changes everything.

890
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,240
And I was, yes indeed.

891
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,720
Big lad, he ended as he did, which, say, the talent is in the driver's scene.

892
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,520
Whether you want money or not, ultimately it comes down to that.

893
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,280
Mainly, it's all summarized in one word.

894
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,160
Your passion.

895
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,560
That's what people come to your podcast to hear.

896
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,960
That's what you should give them.

897
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,160
Don't worry about the business model.

898
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,080
Don't worry about how you're going to make money.

899
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,520
You're doing this because you love it.

900
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,560
Don't forget that.

901
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,520
Podcasting is a breakthrough because it's cheap and easy to do.

902
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,000
And anybody who has something to say can say it.

903
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,160
In less God forbid, you get an audience.

904
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,680
I don't think that was very good advice.

905
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:37,440
Subsequently, in the years since then, there's been many, many podcasters who have literally

906
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,640
run out of bandwidth, podcasts, hostings, companies have gone down.

907
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:46,440
We've brought these people into our network immediately just to keep them going.

908
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,680
Of course, it's much more stable now, but you can see what can happen.

909
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,120
This could happen anybody.

910
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:59,560
If any show just starts to take off, bandwidth is an issue.

911
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,480
And then, you know, if you want to offset that with commercials, and obviously, I think,

912
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,240
you know, having a commercial podcast, you can still be very passionate about what you're

913
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,240
doing.

914
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,520
I'm passionate about the commercials we do.

915
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,520
Let's speak in a voice.

916
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,520
Haven't even done any today.

917
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,720
What do I have to do here?

918
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,720
The Accurate Targetcast.

919
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,720
Right.

920
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,720
Accurate.podge.com.

921
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,720
No, I saw the test drive girl video for driving the Accurate Art.

922
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,520
He actually couldn't check that out.

923
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,520
Test drive.

924
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,520
Grilled.podge.com.

925
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,960
But it's an interesting car.

926
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,520
It talks back to you a lot, kind of like the Jaguar does.

927
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,680
Except the, I think the price is a little different.

928
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,680
Probably, it probably drinks as much gasoline, go juice.

929
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:45,840
But anyway, I think it's, I'm very happy to see a big media property, because that's

930
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,960
what I consider to be, it's really a media property.

931
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,960
I'm happy to see it following in the business model that is being established.

932
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:00,600
And I'm going to be listening really closely to what the execution is of their advertising.

933
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:08,040
And Leo, again, obviously, if you would like to have Podge show try a couple matches with

934
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,040
advertisers, you know where to reach me.

935
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,040
Fuck it.

936
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,040
I'll call you.

937
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,680
All right, everybody, anything left?

938
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:22,480
No, the only thing left is a little more pod safe for music for you to take out on this Wednesday

939
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,480
night Thursday.

940
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,360
I love you every single day.

941
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,160
I love you from the moment that away.

942
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,880
I love you all the new 11.0.

943
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:37,320
I love you wherever you go.

944
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,360
I love your hair and your smile, your teeth and your eyes and your thighs.

945
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,000
You're so much more beautiful than me.

946
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,680
We should be together, we would be so happy.

947
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,080
I picked you up and down the streets.

948
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,720
You are walking next to me.

949
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,280
Hand in hand, we walk along.

950
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:03,960
We'll be so happy people will say it's wrong.

951
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,600
I love you every single day.

952
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,240
I love you from the moment that away.

953
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,880
I love you more than you will ever know.

954
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:17,240
I love you wherever you go.

955
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,320
You took an order against me.

956
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,040
The magistrate said that I was naughty.

957
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,080
Within a thousand feet of you I cannot go.

958
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:30,200
I watch you from the edge of the exclusion zone.

959
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,680
Yesterday you were wearing pink.

960
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,000
You went into the park for a drink.

961
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,040
You had scotch and coke with the man named Brett.

962
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,720
Brett is dead because Brett was a threat to me.

963
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,360
I love you every single day.

964
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,920
I love you from the moment that away.

965
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,560
I love you more than you will ever know.

966
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:57,240
I love you wherever you go.

967
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:07,880
There isn't anything that I would rather do than spend the rest of my life with you.

968
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:20,840
But they want to send me to jail because I sent you my love in the mail.

969
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:26,440
I want to keep you in a box of beautiful box with velvet lining and a hole in the lint.

970
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,960
So I can slip your food.

971
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,240
We'll be together.

972
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,400
It will be so good.

973
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,880
I love you every single day.

974
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,040
I love you every single way.

975
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:43,640
We'll be together just you and me and the woods in the cabin in a box for eternity.

976
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,600
I love you every single day.

977
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,240
I love you from the moment that away.

978
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,800
I love you more than you will ever know.

979
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,800
I love you wherever you go.

980
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,560
I love you every single day.

981
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,200
I love you from the moment that away.

982
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,440
I love you more than you will ever know.

983
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,720
Of course, it's hot safe.

984
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,240
It's from down on.

985
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,040
It's the gorskees and every single day.

986
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,200
A nice song, just like it, it was really sweet.

987
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,240
I think I played them before.

988
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,440
Internet girl, that was the song that I played by those guys before.

989
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,280
All right, everybody's on off to London Town tomorrow again.

990
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:29,320
But oh and Ron and I, I think it's probably been about a year.

991
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,440
We've been a strategy guest as well and we keep threatening to do one.

992
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,600
But I think we actually might pull it off this time.

993
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,040
Unless we get really busy as usual.

994
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,120
All right, I'm off to bed everybody.

995
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,720
Thanks for listening.

996
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,560
DailySourceCode.com.

997
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,000
That's where we can find all the links to everything discussed in today's show notes.

998
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,120

999
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,560
Talk to you tomorrow everybody.

1000
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,200
Bye bye.

1001
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,800
49, a folder, a happy listener.

1002
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,240
And this is when you are your best.

1003
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,320
When you're talking about all your experience in music.

1004
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,120
So the just solo guitar, I love it.

1005
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,480
When you, I know what I just played was you going up.

1006
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,360
But you just do an excellent job of just bringing it all together and tying it together.

1007
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,360
It's a joy to listen to you every day.

1008
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,360
And thank you very much.

1009
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,000
Take care, bye.

1010
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,880
