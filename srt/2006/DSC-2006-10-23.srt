00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,400
From the Curry Cottage Hillford UK, from the Curry Condo, San Francisco, or from the Curry

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,000
Cockbidders, guys above, wherever Adam might be.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,240
There's always the Daily Source Code, this is episode number 483, with Adam Curry.

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,240
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,240
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,240
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,240
Welcome to the robot weather in Celsius for the Guildford region on Monday to 23rd October.

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,240
Today, chance of righting with the maximum temperature of 13 degrees.

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,240
To not chance of righting with the minimum temperature of 11 degrees.

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,240
Tomorrow, chance of righting with the maximum temperature of 12 degrees.

11
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:11,240
My favorite situation is, I'm always the kick-ups.

12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,240
I'll be first a cast.

13
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,240
I don't need to sweep it down the line.

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,240
I'll sit in front of my turn.

15
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,240
Just take it to the top.

16
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,240
I'll scream in till my lunchbox.

17
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,240
I'll stand here till I drive.

18
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,240
The feeling is leaving.

19
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,240
It's so dark.

20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,240
It's the sleeping.

21
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,240
We don't stop.

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,240
I'll be in the cup with the suit.

23
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,240
And now, I'll stand for the wind and nothing coming.

24
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,240
Baby that.

25
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,240
I know you hate me.

26
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,240
And you can change me.

27
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,240
You make the watch so fine.

28
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,240
But it's no matter I can see you.

29
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,240
You used to be so special.

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,240
Now I want all the time.

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,240
You think the same will meet.

32
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,240
Just say, don't decide.

33
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,240
The feeling is leaving.

34
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,240
It's so dark.

35
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,240
It's the sleeping.

36
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
We don't stop.

37
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,240
I'll be in the cup with the suit.

38
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,240
And now, I'll be in the cup with the suit.

39
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,240
I'll be in the cup with the suit.

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,240
Now I'll be in the cup with the suit.

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,240
We just say, don't stop.

42
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:49,240
It's just a maze where I don't want you

43
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,240
It's just a maze where I don't want you

44
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,240
You make a much better fun

45
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,240
But we don't matter what you think

46
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Oh, what?

47
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,240
Oh, what?

48
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,240
It's been a long time ago

49
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,240
It's just a way to get me

50
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:19,240
But I know this isn't one thing

51
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:26,240
One thing we won't mind about

52
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,240
You can put my name on the top line

53
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Yeah, baby

54
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,240
I don't need to pay me

55
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,240
I don't want you

56
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,240
You know what you're doing?

57
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,240
I don't want you

58
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,240
You're just a maze where I don't want you

59
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,240
You're just a maze where I don't want you

60
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,240
I don't pay me

61
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
I don't pay me

62
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,240
I don't pay me

63
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,240
I don't want you

64
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,240
You make a much better fun

65
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
But I know this isn't one thing

66
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,240
I don't want you

67
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,240
You make a much better fun

68
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,240
It's a way to get me

69
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Danko Jones

70
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,240
Baby hates me

71
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,240
Kickin' off another week of the Daily Source Code

72
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
Can you hear it?

73
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Can you feel it?

74
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
Can you feel the sound?

75
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Yeah, I'm back at the Curry Cottage

76
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
Everybody

77
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,240
It is a Daily Source Code episode

78
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
483

79
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,240
Good to be back home

80
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,240
It's, well, you already heard the weather

81
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
So, you know, it's kind of crappy

82
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,240
That's something new we're going to be launching

83
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,240
In the next week or next couple of weeks

84
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,240
There's the robot weather, fill in your zip code

85
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
And automatically automatically

86
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,240
Apodcast is created with your weather

87
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
I think it's twice a day

88
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
So

89
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
Yeah

90
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
It's good to be back

91
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,240
You can tell it's still a little bit of

92
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240
Hairball left in the throat

93
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,240
Oh, it's so nice to have my two

94
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
Processor back

95
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,240
Oh, I just love it

96
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,240
Really, it makes such a difference

97
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,240
When you've got a particular sound

98
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,240
That particularly when you can just talk

99
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,240
As loud as you want

100
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,240
And everything jams into the

101
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Compressor, into the whole sound system

102
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,240
It's kind of driving a car

103
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
You know, it's like

104
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
Your own car always drives the best

105
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,240
You know how to drive it

106
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,240
And then setting up a buying a new car

107
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240
Has always little takes a little getting used to

108
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,240
So that's kind of what I got going on at the condo

109
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,240
I got to get me another one of these TLAs

110
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
Though for over there

111
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,240
Just so much better

112
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,240
I'm kind of missing that noise gate

113
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
Though you know you hear

114
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
So much more noise in the background

115
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
You can hear

116
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,240
It's just a lot of noise here

117
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,240
I've got the

118
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
The mini fridge running

119
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
I've got the fan on the

120
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,240
VIO is probably kicking into high gear

121
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
And there's a couple of max

122
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,240
That are still on

123
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
Anyway, so here's something new

124
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,240
I get back yesterday

125
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
Patricia, you know, let's me like

126
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,240
Bring my suitcase upstairs

127
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
She says, okay, let's hop in the car

128
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
I gotta go show you something

129
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,240
Of course, a house

130
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,240
And it was pouring rain

131
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,240
It was absolutely pissing out of the skies

132
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,240
I mean like we took took umbrellas

133
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,240
Went to the place

134
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,240
I have to say she is found quite a gem

135
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,240
Really, very nice

136
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,240
In Guilford

137
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,240
And with more space

138
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,240
More rooms, more garden, more view

139
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,240
More modern

140
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,240
Fantastic

141
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,240
And we just got back about 20 minutes ago

142
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
And guess what?

143
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,240
We'll be moving in

144
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,240
In January

145
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
Can you believe it?

146
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,240
After all this going back and forth

147
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
All this crap that we've been going through

148
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,240
Within three seconds

149
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
We take care of business

150
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
I'm so happy

151
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,240
So there's going to be a lot of

152
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
A lot of interesting times in the next couple months

153
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,240
Traveling back and forth between here and San Francisco

154
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
Getting the whole second

155
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Sorry

156
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
Not used to

157
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,240
I forgot about the blackberry

158
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,240
Doesn't work on this setup

159
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,240
Yeah, moving, packing

160
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,240
Oh, how about this?

161
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,240
How about trying to get broadband

162
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,240
And installed before we move

163
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,240
Oh, yeah, it's going to be very, very interesting times

164
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
And of course, you'll be along for the ride

165
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,240
Okay, Adam, I'm slightly grossed out now

166
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,240
I'm listening to the DSC

167
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
On my pay for him

168
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
And

169
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,240
Listening to the story of our woman touching herself

170
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,240
And the sound of your voice

171
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240
That's it

172
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
I'm listening to the show

173
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
The woman touches herself

174
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,240
Right

175
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
So really grossed out now

176
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,240
And appreciate it

177
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
He didn't play anymore comments like that

178
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
It's sparkling in the morning

179
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,240
To think about it

180
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
Thanks

181
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
Bye

182
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,240
Of course we're referring to Giselle

183
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,240
If you didn't hear Friday show where Giselle called in

184
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,240
You've got to go back and check it out

185
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,240
I'm really full of my Friday

186
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,240
Dude, I'm sorry, maybe you should not listen to the show on your paper

187
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
Around early in the morning

188
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,240
Maybe if I get her to talk about you

189
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,240
Would that make a difference?

190
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Would it make you feel a little bit better?

191
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240
I think so

192
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,240
So please don't take away all my jalis

193
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
Made a super big mistake last week

194
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,240
And I was thinking I didn't want to make this mistake

195
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,240
And somehow it slipped out anyway

196
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,240
I played the, actually I'll do it

197
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
I'll play it for you again

198
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
The folder scruncher jingle

199
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
And for some reason I don't know why

200
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
I miss identified this as being something

201
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,240
That was made by Jeff Smith

202
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,240
You know this one right?

203
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,240
People talk about it baby

204
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
Of course it's fantastically done this

205
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
I'm doing it wrong

206
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
Doing it wrong

207
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
Don't you worry baby

208
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
Don't worry

209
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Because I'm wiping, wiping, wiping my book

210
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
Of course not pot safe, but shit

211
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
I'm a roller

212
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
I'm a scruncher

213
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
I'm a roller

214
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
And I'm a buncher

215
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,240
I do my business on the throne

216
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
I'm a sitter

217
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
I'm a standard

218
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,240
I'm a left-right tender

219
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,240
It's nice to know I'm not alone

220
00:08:52,240 --> 00:09:04,240
So of course I was pretty stupid

221
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Because the person who made that is none other than slow

222
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,240
Everybody's slow

223
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
And he sent me a really nice email

224
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
He said you know I totally understand where you

225
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
You probably forgot and was thinking of Jeff Smith

226
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
I've done that because he does all these great jingles

227
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
Not just for the daily source code

228
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,240
He doesn't afford it

229
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
I think everyone in podcasting now

230
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,240
He stopped by Jeff Smith

231
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,240
The Jeff Smith dot com

232
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
At one point or another

233
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
And then slotted something really cool

234
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,240
He said if anyone really deserves a jingle

235
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,240
It's Jeff Smith

236
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,240
And that's an interesting point

237
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,240
Because you know it's hard

238
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
I don't like making openings

239
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
And jingles and imaging and sound bits

240
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
For my own show

241
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
It sounds weird

242
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
You want someone else to do it

243
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,240
Which is why I'm always begging and pleading for more new intros

244
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,240
I need a

245
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,240
484, 485, 46, 47, 488, 49

246
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
I've got a 490

247
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,240
And so what slotted it is he created a jingle for Jeff Smith

248
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,240
And I was blown away by this check it out

249
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,240
Jeff Smith, Jeff Smith

250
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,240
It's another jingle from Jeff Smith

251
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Just give him a subject and he should've come up

252
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
Please

253
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,240
Yeah, I'm another jingle from me

254
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,240
Jeff Smith

255
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,240
Crap

256
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
I want one of those

257
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Dude, please

258
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
I want the lady singing harmony

259
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
It's fantastic

260
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
I love it

261
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,240
Now bring up

262
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,240
This is Angie B. Hostess of the Chill Count

263
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Special guest Moshing in the studio this week

264
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,240

You know before the internet

271
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,240
You know who is going to play your music on the radio

272
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Just really excited about

273
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,240
The idea that one can do it like this

274
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,240
You know, rope with someone who you've never met in person

275
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,240
And endowed over the internet

276
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,240
It's a great way to meet people

277
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,240

We still have that soap opera

292
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,240
Which she's already done her half

293
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,240

00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,240
The right sound and everything in the condo

300
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,240

He's got like 18 podcasts

304
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
It's unbelievable to be on stuff he's doing

305
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,240
And I think he got Joe Klein to cut this form

306
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,240
It's of course, you know

307
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,240

Very nice nightmare in Emedyville

325
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,240
I

326
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,240
Didn't get a lot of responses

327
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,240
To my question about French vanilla

328
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,240
We were talking about Splenda last weekend the last week Friday whatever

329
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,240
And there was a question that came in why why is it always French vanilla

330
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,240
What are the French known for and low and behold

331
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,240
John Glass Cox sends in an email

332
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,240
French vanilla contains egg yolks

333
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
Or an extra fortification of egg yolks

334
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,240
The term here comes quote

335
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,240
The term French vanilla

336
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,240
Has often used to designate preparations that actually have a strong vanilla aroma

337
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,240
And possibly contain vanilla grains

338
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,240
But originates from the French style of making ice cream

339
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,240
Custard base with vanilla beans, cream and egg yolks

340
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,240
Voila

341
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Seto

342
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,240
A little lesson in French vanilla

343
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,240
And all you got to do now is mix up with some hazelnut

344
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
I can't get it over here

345
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,240
I can't get the Splenda's

346
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,240
I wonder if they're going to go international with that or not

347
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,240
They should

348
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
Shit they've got enough people talking about it now

00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,240

00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,040
....the music Today a part by Isaac Nott

372
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,060
And I came to see Girl

373
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,280
thevert to be a part.

374
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,820
stay.

375
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,300
I'll find Mega🜰파Kats that held your club it's

376
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,960
experience from beginning to end.

377
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,400
So be sure to check us out.

378
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,420
Alpha, Mega inverkats!

379
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,300
You want some crunch you want to listen to that, the

380
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:53,780
alpha megapodcast from HotLana. You can find that at podshow.com, of course.

381
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:59,380
So I want to tell you a bit about what you can look forward to in the next couple of weeks.

382
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:04,020
I've been more than hinting about the official unleash of theBTpodshow.com, which will

383
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:11,140
kick off the end of the first week, the beginning of the second week of November, which

384
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:20,180
means, well, excuse me, be opening it up, wide. And of course, this will be a very UK

385
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:27,300
centric, but all a part of our original system and platform. And at the same time,

386
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,740
this is where it gets really exciting. We're also going to be releasing a new version of

387
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:38,580
podshow.com, podshow plus it's for really going to be adding a whole bunch of features,

388
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,300
room-moving a lot of things that didn't make any sense. Whole new layout, whole new graphics,

389
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,660
and we've been working on this for quite a while, obviously. And so we're going to have,

390
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:54,020
and we're integrating the pod save music network, it'll stand on its own, so nothing is

391
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:59,060
really going to change if you go to music.podshow.com, however, now pieces of that will be

392
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:05,700
integrated into podshow plus itself. So you'll have music, podcast, and video. So we're adding

393
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:10,740
a category there, even though you can create a podcast out of anything you want, including videos,

394
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:16,820
which a lot of people are doing now at podshow. You'll also be able to upload videos into

395
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:24,980
a separate path, which will allow you to publish something quickly. Very much the way YouTube does,

396
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:30,020
it only there will be some very cool ways to integrate that into a podcast if you want to,

397
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:35,460
it can stand alone. It's a lot of thought, a lot of hard work has gone into this. So you'll see

398
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:41,780
that showing up, probably around the same time as we launch btpodshow.com, and then there's something

399
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:47,460
else called the plus, which we haven't really talked about, but I think I've been hinting about

400
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,700
that as well. It's an additional video project that anyone will be able to participate in,

401
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,060
and I think you're really going to like it. I don't want to say too much about that right now.

402
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,900
I want to concentrate on the btpodshow.com launch and the new version of podshow,

403
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:08,420
with new modules for, it's going to be so different. It is a total mind fucker when you see.

404
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,420
It's like, oh, wait a minute. Now starting, nothings are starting to come together. We've been

405
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:18,180
releasing features and fixes and stomping on bugs for, well, since we launch, which was August

406
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:24,020
September three months ago. That's when we unleashed. So you're going to, I think, I think you're

407
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:31,940
like it. There will be a lot of changes, a lot of things. Hopefully, I'll be here for the next

408
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:37,940
couple weeks, and we'll be able to be here for podcastcon UK that I believe is on these and on the

409
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,260
18th. Yeah, I think it's the 18th of November. There's also some other stuff that's been going on

410
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:46,260
and luckily enough, you folks are nice enough to keep me updated while I was away.

411
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:51,140
Hello Adam, A's GD from GD's by size bonus here. I just give me a gig report and what's been

412
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:56,340
happening in the UK while we've been away. As you know, we had podfests down the purple turtle.

413
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:02,020
Yes, gone safe and the purple turtle. And it was a nice, absolutely fantastic. This was last Thursday

414
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:08,820
the 19th of October. We had four great brands on the bill. It worked wonders for the UK music podcasting.

415
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:14,020
So many people coming into the place and knowing who we were basically saying, yes, I listened to

416
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:19,300
your podcast, which is tremendous. As you had one girl, a New Zealand girl who works for BT and

417
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:24,020
came up to me and said, ah, I know all about podcasting because BTs involved with BT podshow,

418
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,660
which I thought was brilliant. She said she's going to spread the word about the gigs that we're

419
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:33,540
doing at podfests. Now you missed this one. No problem mate. No problem. We're doing it all again

420
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,260
in November the 29th. I hope you're in the UK then and who come down. I would love to see

421
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,700
there and show you how was Brits know how to rock out and have a good night out. Make sure

422
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:54,580
it's a date for your diary. Purple turtle, 29th November, it's podfests. More details at www.podfests.co.uk.

423
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:04,500
Another purple turtle extravaganza podfests UK. All right. Yeah, I think it'll work out perfectly.

424
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,140
I may be able to hit podcaster car and then go to the San Francisco and come back and be in time

425
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:16,260
for the purple turtle extravaganza looking forward to it. What else was it going to say? There was

426
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:22,260
something about it. There was a crap. Screw it. I don't remember. Maybe it'll come back.

427
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,380
Found that Howard Jones is on the pod save music network Howard Jones of course have been

428
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:33,060
playing his records ever since I was 19 and looking at the picture of him on the pod save music

429
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:38,340
network. It's and he's lost a lot of hair since then. It's like receded all the way back.

430
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,580
But it's great. And there's a little blurb up here. He has released one track,

431
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:50,580
which he put up on 20. He put up yesterday. Released for podcasters to promote the forthcoming

432
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:57,540
UK hit makers tour with ABC and Toya. A world tour is to follow in 2007. When playing this track,

433
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:03,300
please include tour details and this link. Oh, hold on. podcast live. Oh, I see. There's

434
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,980
no interesting. Let's see if we can open this up. What is this link? That's an interesting

435
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:13,620
way to do that to promote something. The pod save music network home on this link is a little

436
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:20,420
messed up. We'll fit tour dates dot pdf. Cool. Oh, we have a 404 arrow at the

437
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:27,620
fuckers. That can't be right. Hold on. HJ tour dates dot pdf. Looks like I'm

438
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:34,340
shithead. Let me just go look at that home page and see if there's anything there about how

439
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:44,820
a Jones tour dates. Well, there's a link to podcast live dot code dot UK. But the link that

440
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:52,980
how a Jones put in the pod save music network is not working. I'll have to look into that. Okay,

441
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,820
so we'll find out what the tour dates are in the meantime. I wanted to take a listen to the song

442
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,540
because it's I really liked it. It's kind of like classic Howard Jones, but

443
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:12,260
modernized. Oh, no 80's vibe. Just rocking. Building our own future. From the pod save music network,

444
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,820
Howard Jones on DSC or 83.

445
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:51,780
What we feel in the morning to meet this song between the live and the dark song.

446
00:22:51,780 --> 00:23:05,780
So take a step in this place. God have been building our own future. Just for now,

447
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:16,420
day by day. Three, two, two, a life. It's been for more of us.

448
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:26,180
Putting people's lives at the top is the first consideration.

449
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:40,580
Changing in the heart of just one of the world of things and timing sounds.

450
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:53,940
Don't give it up to the free table for us around this way. It's a song between the

451
00:23:53,940 --> 00:24:08,340
in and the outside. So take a step in this place. God has been building our own future.

452
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:21,140
Just for now, day by day. Three, two, two, a life. It's been for more of us.

453
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:43,140
So take a step in this place. God have been building our own future. Just for now, day by day.

454
00:24:43,140 --> 00:25:05,060
God have been building our own future. Just for now, day by day. Three, two, three, two, a life. It's been for more of us.

455
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:19,060
So take a step in this place. God have been building our own future. Just for now,

456
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:33,460
day by day. Three, two, two, a life. It's been for more of us.

457
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:50,020
So you got to hold it, rock? Our Jones has that great way of producing the, you kind of

458
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:57,460
like that snare back, back, back, very typical for him. Sounds lovely. Building our own future,

459
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,260
how are Jones? You can find it at music.podshow.com or through the show notes at dailysourceco.com.

460
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:10,420
I found it. So I'll put that link into the show notes for the PDF. There was a little space that's snuck in there accidentally.

461
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:17,220
How it will be performing at the Historic Avalon Theatre in eastern on the 26th of October.

462
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:25,060
The Oakville Center for Performing Arts in Toronto on the 27th, the 28th. Let me see.

463
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:30,500
Then he's coming over to the UK on the 2nd of November. That's the hitmiggers tour with ABC and Toya.

464
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:36,100
That could be kind of cool. So he'll be at in Bristol on the 2nd,

465
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:41,300
Ipswich on the 3rd, Reading on the 9th. He's coming to London, Birmingham on the 11th. Let me see.

466
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:46,660
So okay. He's going to do Folkston on the 23rd,

467
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:52,820
Portsmouth. Okay. Portsmouth is on December 1st. That's, well, we might go there. I think that's

468
00:26:52,820 --> 00:27:00,420
not where we saw Jones call it. Before I forget, I could use a couple more phone calls.

469
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:20,020
You guys have gotten a little bit lazy. I'll give me a call. Let me know what you're up to,

470
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:24,020
which is thinking of Friday. By the way, I spoke to the wing commander this morning.

471
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,700
The Delta Sierra, my aircraft has been completely overhauled.

472
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:34,180
He really went from front to back, top to bottom, took everything off, opened everything up,

473
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:42,340
re-adjusted all bits and pieces. Remember, I did have a hard landing, which bugged the ASI,

474
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:48,660
the air speed indicator. And so he figured it was a good time to go and check everything.

475
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:53,460
So apparently, she's completely ready. And what he said to me was, I look at Friday's good.

476
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:58,340
I'm coming over Friday. I'll pick you up. Then we'll fly back. Then we'll do a couple of circuits.

477
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,940
We'll fly around a bit. It's always good to get some extra instruction from the wing commander.

478
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:07,460
And then he'll pack me off solo on the trip back home. He says it's time. It's time you do this.

479
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:13,540
So that could be a very big adventure for me. And of course, I'll be recording every single step

480
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:18,260
of the way. At least we'll have something for prosperity, right? Okay tomorrow, I'll get the

481
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:23,060
lady Patricia on. We'll talk about the new house and have an update from Pod Show HQ more

482
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:27,860
about the launch here. Yeah, the typical stuff. Take care yourself. Adam at PodShow.com. Thank you.

483
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,140
So much for listening. Bye.
