I'm testing this battle curry

oh come that one or come yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah shit, you

30
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:11,640
You know, it just doesn't get any better than to kick off a show with some cowbell from the

31
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,640
Pods eight music network.

32
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,280
I caught that one on the ultimate mix podcast.

33
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,160
That was, oh no, you hear that?

34
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,520
That's my new blackberry is going off on the second stingray, one, four, three, it's from

35
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,320
music.podshow.com, and it's from their CD Ghost in the attic.

36
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,320
Yeah, indeed.

37
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,920
Got a new blackberry, everyone got an upgrade in the office.

38
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:45,280
I have the 8700 model, the 8700 Charlie C for singular, I guess.

39
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,720
And I got to say pretty impressed.

40
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,920
This is the one with the new screen, it's got a faster processor inside, it utilizes

41
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:58,160
the edge network, actually quite nice I have to say, it has a full-fledged internet browser

42
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,400
in it, not just like the singular web browser, you can choose between which one you want

43
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
to use.

44
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Yeah, I like it.

45
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
I really do.

46
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,120
And it was real simple reconfiguring everything, you just had to enter the IMEI number or something

47
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,240
like that, and then re-sinked it up to my Mac with Pocket Mac.

48
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,360
Voila, Presto, it was completely ready and beautiful.

49
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,720
Let me just put it over there.

50
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,360
So it doesn't bother us too much.

51
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,720
Let me see, so I did spend some time configuring a couple new applications.

52
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,520
The coolest thing is Google Maps, it's basically it's a hybrid between Google Maps and

53
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,600
Google Local.

54
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,840
It's an application that you actually load onto your device, you can download it over

55
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,480
the air.

56
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,360
And you just type in an address or a zip code or if you want directions and it gives

57
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,000
you the map and it gives you the satellite images too and it's really, really fast.

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's unbelievable.

59
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,600
You can even put an, not IKO, but like the consumer airport codes and it'll, it'll

60
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,600
show, it'll take you right there, it's amazing, I was able to find the cottage, although

61
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,040
interestingly enough, and I think this is still the same in Google Earth and any Google,

62
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,040
was it Google Maps.

63
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:21,160
If you look at the address of the condo, it basically shows one big construction site because

64
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,480
the pictures are that old apparently.

65
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,760
And then I installed this IM plus, and it's a trial version, but IM plus basically gives

66
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,440
you instant messaging clients for, what is it?

67
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:41,040
Yahoo, MSN, AOL and Jabber and Google Talk, and so I've configured all that, and that's

68
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
actually pretty cool.

69
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:48,040
I haven't had enough, I am traffic to really be able to give you good report, but the

70
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,880
speed of it all is certainly getting there.

71
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,280
That was really the problem on previous Blackberry devices.

72
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,960
This new one is just fast and it's nice and, like, I really like it.

73
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,600
And you can find that, of course, I'll put a link in the show notes, but I think it's

74
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,680
a Google.com slash GLM Gulf Lima, Mike.

75
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,280
And the ongoing conversation about the mysterious Apple Powerbook audio echo issue.

76
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:20,280
Hey Adam, this is some feedback from DSC 311, where you were talking about the audio echo

77
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,280
with your power book.

78
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,800
And as I was sitting here listening to your podcast, I was having a conversation with

79
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,240
you while you were talking about the problems that you were having, and it went something

80
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,240
like this.

81
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,760
Hey, you know, this is very, very freaky.

82
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,120
Now I know that certainly some people at Apple listen to this podcast, so let's find out

83
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,120
about it.

84
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,240
Is it something that can be fixed?

85
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,560
Is it a hardware problem?

86
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,840
Yeah, it can be fixed.

87
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,080
Now, and it's definitely not a hardware problem.

88
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,480
Or is it a software problem?

89
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,240
It certainly seems to be very intermittent.

90
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,000
I actually rebooted my computer before doing the show.

91
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's not going to fix it Adam.

92
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,120
Just to make sure that I'd be kind of fresh with a clean boot up and amazing.

93
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,560
You don't hear it happen very often.

94
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,600
It usually happens when I'm using, you know what?

95
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,920
It could be a quick time thing.

96
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,840
No, that's not a quick time Adam, because I think that it only happens when I'm using

97
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,240
iTunes, what I'm using a quick time.

98
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,200
I'm trying to think if it's ever happened while I was watching like a Windows media maybe

99
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,520
clip or something.

100
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,480
That could be, but certainly gosh.

101
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,200
Okay, well, we have to start tracking this and start paying attention to when exactly

102
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
it happens.

103
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:39,720
Obviously, a culprit that comes to mind right off the top of my head is a quick time.

104
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,680
But it certainly is not very good if you're using your machine for podcasting.

105
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,120
No, you're right Adam, and it's not a good thing at all if you're trying to record.

106
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,600
But thankfully, there are a lot of people out there that are having this problem and there

107
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,520
is a documented fix.

108
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:59,520
The thing that people are finding out there right now that seems to fix this problem,

109
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:05,320
although people aren't sure yet if this fixes it 100% of the time is if you go to the

110
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:11,240
library preferences file that's at the root level of your hard drive, not your user library,

111
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,120
but the OS library.

112
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,440
So go to the root level of your hard drive, go to library and preferences and look for

113
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,720
the audio device settings preference file.

114
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:31,080
The name of that pile is com.appel.audio.device settings.pless.

115
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,040
And if you delete that, then that seems to fix the trouble that a lot of people are experiencing

116
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,160
with the echo issue.

117
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,400
So give that a try.

118
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,000
I haven't tried that myself, but I've got an older 15 inch power book, so I'm not experiencing

119
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,160
the trouble.

120
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,520
But give that a try.

121
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
Let's see if that works.

122
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,680
And if that works, then maybe we've got it fixed.

123
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,320
And as always, I'll go ahead and get my plug in here.

124
00:09:53,320 --> 00:10:00,720
People can check me out at nulmyster.com, and I've got the nulmyster podcast there, and

125
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,640
it's just kind of the, I call it the ramblings of an everyday kind of guy.

126
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,760
So it's just, I've put it together for friends and family to keep track of of what I'm

127
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,960
up to.

128
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,400
So it's not the world's greatest podcast, but it seems to work for all my friends and

129
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,160
family to keep track of what I'm up to.

130
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,840
And we love the daily source code.

131
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,160
So keep up the great work at them and take it easy.

132
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,960
Right on Robert, thank you.

133
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Thank you very much.

134
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
Thank you very much everybody.

135
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,480
Well, let me just get my levels all straight here.

136
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,480
This is, if you listen to this on serious satellite stars 103, this is the daily source

137
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:41,040
code, start of the pod show line up four hours of pod cast on channel 103.

138
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:48,600
The problem with the audio last night, after I'd kind of wound everything down, I turned

139
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,800
on actually with the ultimate mixed podcast, that's how I heard, I actually got another

140
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,440
song from that show, which I'm going to play at the end of today's source code.

141
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,880
So I had a nice bubble bath, you know, and I had the sound system hooked up to the

142
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,640
logic tech MM50, so I got some boom and sound, and if it didn't happen again, it did.

143
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,880
It started echoing, it went away all by itself, so I didn't have to actually get out

144
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,480
of the bathtub.

145
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,960
And let's, you know, it's not an echo for those of you who haven't heard it, it's like

146
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:23,160
a CD that gets stuck, just keeps on repeating at consistent intervals.

147
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,800
So it came back, after I did the P-list deletion thing, there's also reports of this happening

148
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:35,560
on other Mac hardware, on-board snare, I think, and that's how you are on-board, no,

149
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
on-board.

150
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,840
I think it's probably on-board, Gmail messed up, the, uh, some characters here.

151
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,400
Happens as well on my Mac mini and my iMac G5.

152
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:51,200
Haven't had it happen on either on my G5, not the one here at the condo nor the one at

153
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,480
the cottage.

154
00:11:52,480 --> 00:12:00,040
So now wondering, is it, is it related to specific hardware, or, um, is that just a fluke?

155
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,600
I mean, if it happened on different hardware, then it has to be, um, something OS related,

156
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,720
or maybe some new components that got put into these new machines.

157
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,960
I don't know, but, uh, it definitely is, uh, it's not cool, you know, it's, it's got to

158
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,160
get fixed because this is why I got this computer and, uh, although it hasn't happened

159
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,520
a lot during recording, it is extremely annoying.

160
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:27,800
Ah, let me see, what happened here, I thought I had, uh, I think you'd, uh, was this,

161
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:34,520
I had, uh, was this, oh, man, I hate it when this happens, okay, I'll just

162
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,840
play it off a quick time here.

163
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:41,320
This was, uh, a comment that came in about, um, language, specifically the language

164
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,840
used on this podcast.

165
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,920
Hello, Adam, this is Stephen Pender from karate cast.

166
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,080
You know, while back I was listening to one of your shows and I believe a person had left

167
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:57,520
you a comment, uh, saying that he had reported you for not having an explicit tag on your

168
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:04,080
show and I thought about this and I know that, uh, some people may think that you use

169
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,600
some harsh language on your show and that it may require this explicit tag, but you

170
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,160
know something, I'm thinking to myself here that it really after watching most of the shows

171
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,400
and the ratings, I'm thinking it probably wouldn't be a half bad idea to throw an explicit

172
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,240
tag on your show.

173
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,640
Your ratings would go up because it seems to work for everyone else and believe me,

174
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,520
I thought about it for myself, I'm, I have a family show, it's rated G, but I thought,

175
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,840
you know, something, I mean, my ratings are going up right now and they're very high.

176
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:39,160
I'm featured on quite a few sites and I'm in the top 50, I guess, for most of them in sports.

177
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,120
And I thought, you know, I could go even higher if I was to put an explicit tag on my show.

178
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,840
So what I thought actually is that I would test this theory.

179
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:53,640
And now for the explicit portion of our show, I'm sure all of you that this is an honest,

180
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,480
but this tastes, so he goes into this whole thing, uh, it lasts for like another two minutes,

181
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,840
so I'm not going to play the whole thing, but, you know, I was thinking a lot about this,

182
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,200
particularly listening to Howard Stern's first show on, um, on serious.

183
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,960
And already you can see the presses is, I have to say, I'm so disappointed yet again by the press.

184
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,600
Man, you guys are so fucking lame and stupid.

185
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,440
It was like, oh, well, it was, uh, it was pretty tame and Howard didn't really, uh,

186
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,000
you know, get her to any bad, fall, language, or obscene, or indesian, but, uh,

187
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,240
like, you're missing the whole point.

188
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,920
It's, um, that stuff is an exception, not a rule.

189
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's just so you can remove the filters.

190
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That is where the brilliance is going to come from.

191
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,600
It's not going to be from being able to say everything, uh, but, uh, not having restrictions.

192
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,720
That's really what it's about.

193
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,560
And, and I could really tell, listen, I've listened to Howard Stern for many, many years, um,

194
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,400
a lot of them while commuting into New York on a daily basis.

195
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,120
And that's really, I would have to say the best way to listen to him.

196
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,920
You know, we're going, particularly when, uh, before he had really hit big incindication,

197
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,840
and it was still, um, very much a New York show.

198
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:05,800
And, um, you know, it's, you can tell that he's so relaxed now because he's just able to drop all the filters.

199
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,040
He's still, he's, his mind is so trained.

200
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:14,040
And by the way, we don't all use, uh, uh, uh, explosives, uh, in, in all of our speech all the time,

201
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,760
you know, that just doesn't happen that way.

202
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:22,440
Um, and so it would make no sense for him to all of a sudden start swearing and, uh,

203
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,680
it makes no sense.

204
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,400
I don't understand why the press thought that that was going to happen for some reason, um,

205
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,080
but he'll be able to explore new boundaries.

206
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:36,280
And that, of course, is, is what we've discovered in podcasting, um, and what we've known for quite a long time,

207
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,240
how wonderful that is not to have to have these filters that are, uh, are always, uh,

208
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,960
consistently present and, uh, and you're always aware of them.

209
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,000
It really slows you down.

210
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,640
So, um, um, I, I was just, you know, kind of flabbergasted by what I was hearing and reading everywhere,

211
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,080
because I actually thought those show was great.

212
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,600
It was just a typical Howard show.

213
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,040
You know, only some of the bits were better, um, because, and just some of the stuff he was saying,

214
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,640
just what the crew was saying was just good because, uh, all the filters have been removed.

215
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:11,400
Uh, anyway, uh, good day, uh, at the office yesterday, uh, just kind of caught up with everybody,

216
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:17,320
uh, uh, today we get the big demo, and, uh, that do we is, uh, Ron and I are getting the big

217
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,120
demo of all the stuff that everyone's been working so hard on for the past, um, and just months

218
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,720
and months, but really, uh, the hardest between, uh, Christmas and New Years.

219
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,320
By the way, the company grew with five employees, uh, uh, over the holiday month.

220
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:38,040
And so I had a lot of new people to meet today, um, extremely smart people, uh, doing all kinds of

221
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,480
just amazing stuff.

222
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,840
And, um, I'm, um, I'm really proud of the stuff that I'm seeing.

223
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:48,760
So, look for, uh, for more comments about that in, uh, in the, in the coming week, and hopefully

224
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,040
we'll be opening some stuff up at the end of this week or next week, whatever.

225
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,600
Uh, coming up, uh, we've got some more, uh, music from the podcast, music network, um,

226
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,880
got a cool audio comment about the flight simulators.

227
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,840
And for the first time today, Yadsey coming up, yet another drum cadence.

228
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,280
Hi, I don't walk on here.

This week on the squad cast walked out of the, you know, restroom and who is standing right outside the restroom,

240
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:16,600
Richard Simmons. And he turns around, looks at me, grabs my hand, he's like, oh, you know,

241
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,240
what's your name? And I'm like, and you said, my name's Anthony.

242
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,320
I think that's your question while you're doing that. What?

243
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,040
I'm on podcast pickle. By the way, voter first three times. Awesome. So, that's why you weren't finding

244
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,720
tonight, you're over to vote. Thank you.

245
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,600
So, Charlie, then you get the June gloom coming in and the June gloom?

246
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,160
Yeah. Do people actually call it that or is that real? Don't do, do they not call it that?

247
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,480
Uh, not bloody familiar with that. What a pleasant way to call Brian a fucking asshole.

248
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,960
It's like 530 out there right now and he's like, oh, these guys. By the way, he was looking

249
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,720
at all kinds of fun. Oh, hell yeah. You think he was? I think I actually heard him yell out, give me

250
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:09,320
to say it for it. But that's squad cast squad cast at gmail.com squad cast squad cast dot com.

251
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,880
You know, I've got so much feedback coming in over the earthling promotion that we're running in

252
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:21,080
the 32nd commercials that we're playing. And why know, earthling is a big client for us,

253
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,440
big customer. And we're working very closely with them and with their agency on, you know,

254
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,400
this whole conversation that we've been having about user generated advertising. But Steve

255
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,320
Gilmore opened up the Gilmore gang. I guess the show was posted on Monday. Yeah, yesterday.

256
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:43,080
And he just, he had this, this, not a rant because he's had, he's had the flu for like a

257
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:49,720
month or something. But just listen to what he said about about earthling and sponsoring the Gilmore

258
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:54,600
gang. It was said, I thought it was pretty cool. Oh, a second. I got to get it from, uh,

259
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,560
see, here we go. I think it's, you know, it's a good story. I don't know what to hear that.

260
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:08,440
So, yeah, Steve Gilmore, welcome to another edition of the Gilmore gang. Today we're going to

261
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:15,720
have a conversation about CES and the after effects of that conference and some of the announcements

262
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:22,440
excluding, of course, the Google announcements, which came after the recording of the show on Friday.

263
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:29,160
So before we get started, I want to say a couple of words about our sponsor earthling. I got

264
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:35,400
some email from somebody who was talking about how they weren't particularly excited about having

265
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:43,240
a mainstream advertiser on the podcast. And I just want to say what I said last week and I want to

266
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:51,320
put it in spades again. There is nothing more valuable than having, excuse me, somebody from the

267
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:58,360
mainstream world of advertising for my perspective, validate the podcast space and contribute their

268
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:06,760
support, time money and encouragement to what we're doing here. So, uh, if the person who's listening

269
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:13,160
to the show is put off by this kind of an ad, although I did notice that they indicated strong

270
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,960
with that this wasn't enough to defer them from listening to the Gilmore gang. The proofs and the

271
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:24,600
pudding, uh, if you think that the show and that the thought leaders who are on the show, John Udell,

272
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:31,720
Doc Seroles, Dana Gardner, Dan Farber, Mike Fizzard, and all the guests that we have,

273
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:38,280
the come on the show from time to time, if you think that those people are important to listen to

274
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:47,400
and important to support, then you should be supporting the people like Earthlink who are supporting

275
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:53,080
us, uh, give them the respect that they're giving us. Thanks. Uh, here's a message from Earthlink

276
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:59,640
and then we'll get on with the show. Right on Steve, way to go. Exactly. Exactly. Hey,

277
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,600
and the advertising community is going to have to learn too. We're all going to have to figure this

278
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:09,560
out. And that, by the way, was a fantastic example of user generated advertising. Hey,

279
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:16,120
congratulations to Brian No, um, I've played a lot of his stuff on the source code, uh, certainly

280
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:24,280
uh, pre the, the switch to all pod save music on DSC. Um, Nancy Sinatra. Now, by the way, if you've never heard

281
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:30,200
the show, it's called the Frank Truth. Um, and it's on the serious, uh, 103 on the stars. Uh,

282
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:38,200
I think we do it on Wednesdays. I believe it is. And, uh, because we can play RIA, music, if we

283
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,960
so wish. And the podcast was so good. It was, you know, it was very, very difficult for him. Um,

284
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,400
he's, uh, you know, he's kind of skating the edge there. But Nancy Sinatra posted a link to

285
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:55,800
his, uh, to his site from there from the Sinatra main website over the weekend. Um, that he is, uh,

286
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:04,680
Brian has reached out to the Sinatra dynasty many times. Never really heard much from him. But, uh,

287
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,320
this was the first time he kind of got a positive sign from some very happy form. Extremely cool.

288
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:15,880
It's a great show. Uh, and the, uh, the Sinatra clan is actually the Sinatra family.com.

289
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,120
That's fine. I, um, you know, that when, um, when, when I first learned about registering

290
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:29,640
domain names, I'm talking 1993, uh, and I'd already registered MTV.com and curry.com. I actually

291
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:36,920
for quite a while had Elvis.com. And I'd set up an email address, uh, which was king at Elvis.com.

292
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:43,320
And there was a one page website and it just said, you know, email the king. And somewhere, uh, in my

293
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:49,640
archive, uh, on some hard drive, in some place, I have thousands of emails of people who would

294
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,720
send, um, a message to Elvis. And they were really amazing. And you could tell that a lot of people,

295
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,560
you know, really were like kind of, you know, believing that he, uh, but he had an email address.

296
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,640
Uh, you could just tell from what they, uh, what they sent to him, uh, but then eventually, um,

297
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:11,560
the, uh, the presently dynasty got in touch with me. And I sent a nice little little letter that said,

298
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,960
uh, give it back. God damn it. And we'll sue your ass. But it was, it was said in a nice way. I guess,

299
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:21,640
kind of, um, get out of the drum cadence on the way. The folks on the serious satellite who are

300
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,720
listening to the show right now have to miss out on that. Uh, so we'll, uh, put the yachts see

301
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,960
early run in the show the next time we do it. Uh, we'll see you guys tomorrow Pacific Coast,

302
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:36,600
Hellway is up next for you on serious. And for us here, I got a very cool email, particularly if you're

303
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:43,640
into aviation or if you, um, you know, if you've ever used a flight simulator, um, I asked the question

304
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:51,240
if you could use the OSX X plane flight sim, uh, to do, um, instrument training.

305
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:58,040
I had him in its Andy last week in DSC three or six. You were asking about X plane and could

306
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:05,240
it be used in a professional way to learn instrument flying rules. I think it can, but then I'm not

307
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:12,520
a pilot. I'm just a user of the program. And since I haven't had anybody come back to you to confirm

308
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:19,320
that you could use it. I'd like to tell you a little bit about it, which might prompt you to take

309
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,200
to the east of the east of the east of the east of the east of the east of the east. There it is.

310
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:30,520
My, my, my is the best flight simulator. That was the, uh, the infamous Apple playback bug.

311
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:39,480
There is. It's got realistic aircraft, cockpit with working instruments. You can fly to any airport in

312
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:48,360
the world using VFR or IFR. And if you file a flight plan, the air traffic controller will

313
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:57,640
recognize you, uh, direct you safely past other traffic, uh, land you. And, uh, it does this using

314
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:05,800
the built-in speech of the size of it in the Mac. It does have working navigational aids, uh,

315
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:13,000
VFR, DME, nav and calm radios, and you have a transponder. Even without the scenery,

316
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:20,520
explain is the most useful flights them you can get. You can fly in any weather situation,

317
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:29,320
which you can dial in in the menu system. You can set the level of precipitation, whether the

318
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:36,280
weather is getting better or worse. You can even download meter information and load that into

319
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:44,520
explain so you can fly in real weather. You can also simulate failures of any part of the aircraft

320
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:52,520
and the probability of that happening over a random time. So you could practice, for example,

321
00:26:53,320 --> 00:27:02,440
an engine failure happening at a random time. Good practice. It even simulates ice on the

322
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,680
comparator if the weather gets too frosty. The level of detail in this program is just amazing,

323
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:14,520
and I only told you a little of what it does. There are also lots of interest groups,

324
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:21,400
which are linked from the X-plane homepage, covering everything from aircraft to scenery to virtually

325
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:30,200
your lines. X-hifinplane.com. If you go there now, you'll see that the latest news is that

326
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:37,560
a customer of theirs who uses their software in a professional flight simulator to train pilots

327
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:44,520
has just got FAA certification. And if their story is true, they are the first software company

328
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:56,200
who produce a consumer grade flight simulator to ever do so. In summary, you just got to get this

329
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:02,120
program. If you're going to be a serious pilot and you want to practice those skills in the most

330
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:08,920
realistic situation, explain is the owner program that will do it. With it, you can practice skills

331
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:19,560
that you will use as a pilot in the real world. Buy it now. Buy it now. Yeah, okay. Well,

332
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,720
it's only 50 bucks or something. Thanks Andy, I appreciate it. So I've made a decision besides

333
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:31,880
the desperate desire for a biodiesel refinery plant here in the Bay Area. So actually,

334
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,960
Sue at Podshow headquarters, you said that if I could somehow get big mics and drums out of the

335
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,960
garage, so she could park there. I could certainly have a corner for my refinery. So that's

336
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:50,840
one project that I want to set up here. Another one, this place is so perfect for a flight simulator.

337
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:56,600
I'm really considering, and I've seen some pre-built stuff that is just amazing. And I could

338
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:04,280
put it right up against the windows. I've got that 180 degree view. I could put it facing the

339
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,760
window, so at night it could be like, you know, it would be kind of dark. The ambient lighting

340
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:16,120
would be dark. I could be just flying. Oh, man. I'm sick. I can't wait to do that. So much to do. So

341
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:25,160
little time. Goddamn. Another idea I had. This is something that I will do. I'd like to do it myself,

342
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,920
but if not, I'm going to have to recruit somebody to do a car podcast. And the car podcast is

343
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,680
actually it's pretty simple. And I think it could also be very commercially viable to go to different

344
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:46,760
dealers. Yeah, so let's say today we grab Volkswagen. And I do a sound seeing tour of driving in the

345
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:52,360
Volkswagen and give a description. And you could really, I think we could give you quite an experience

346
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,160
just by hearing it just listening to it. The narrative of course would be very important. And we

347
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:02,920
just go from dealership to dealership and rent any on that rent and test drive cars. You know,

348
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:08,360
like we actually want to buy it. And anyone who could dress up, you know, kind of nice. If you clean

349
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,720
up a little bit, then you can probably pull this off. So we could do it that way, but even more

350
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:19,800
exciting, I thought, would to be have a collaborative effort and have, you know, just members of

351
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:26,440
this car cast, you know, to select a brand and we'd split it up and then, you know, send it in.

352
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,640
And we'd put it up and we'd, uh, we'd make a show out of it. I'm telling you, this thing will really

353
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,240
sell cars again.

354
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:55,880
Yes, it is yet another drum kit. Thank you very much, Jeff Smith. Since I didn't have any material

355
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,840
for the yet another drum cadence, Jeff was nice enough to send something in that he did himself.

356
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,040
And I didn't realize this. I guess he's Dutch, or at least he lives in the Netherlands,

357
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:09,160
because it acts in his perfect. And he created a drum cadence, which he did entirely with, um,

358
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:17,720
things you find in the kitchen. It is appropriately titled, no can in the coconut. Hey Adam, Jeff Smith

359
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,280
here. I got a little drum cadence for you. I've been working on a kitchen, like to call it,

360
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,400
no can in the coconut, like it.

361
00:31:52,280 --> 00:32:22,280
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

362
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:52,280
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

363
00:32:52,280 --> 00:33:17,560
Thank you Steve Jobs for giving us garage bands

364
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:24,560
See? That's all you need. You don't even know Steak and Studio. You know the damn instruments. Just get yourself a power book.

365
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,560
Watch band and hammer away in the kitchen. It works perfectly.

366
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,560
You've got a drum cadence you want to share.

367
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,560
With the source code on podcast and ultimate mix.

368
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,560
Yeah, the blog spot.com.
