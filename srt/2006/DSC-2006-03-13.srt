1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 352

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm just a kid's fellow curry

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, well, well, I heard you got the mood

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah, I heard you got the mood

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's like they went stuck on you

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, you better not forget

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
They had left you yet

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You still got trinity and all the best damn coffee

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And the whole white world and you're well on your way

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
More hundred million listeners

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And don't forget that rhymes with blogger

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Would still be around and probably got your back

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And hey, you got the pot safe dudes

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And you know that the chase away the blues

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So you know what comes around but go around

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You know what I'm talking about

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So let's all light up a nice piece of love

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And smoke their blues away

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah, once upon a time

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
These lines went broken down

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And on the ground

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Walked up on a time

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And when I was faithful

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The years passed slowly

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Once and once again

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'd smile at her

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And say it's gonna be okay

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yeah

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
A pizza that I've never seen

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That looks so wild and clean

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I see that we'll let she not be

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I've never been so tempted

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I think it'd be my job

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Look at that she's mild to me

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I know I think I'm headed for the center of the world

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
To take it into the center of the world

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Hey, make her a lot of Kevin time

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
A dawn in the city

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hey, yeah, yeah

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
She's my city, she's my thing

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And I'll be sending her

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hey, yeah, yeah

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm gonna put her on my plate

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh, I think I'll lose some weight

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And that if I'm the center of the world

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
To take it into the center of the world

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I've been all the way along

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And I've to pick out cutting bay bay

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, what the fuck's the man like me

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So real and real man

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm really ask you, sister

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm doing all the same

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I've been with this up to man

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You and I got to find a change of plans

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And that if I was better

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That if I was the center of the world

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
To take it into the center of the world

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
To take it into the center of the world

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
To take it into the center of the world

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
To take it into the center of the world

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To take it into the center of the world

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
To take it into the center of the world

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
To take it into the center of the world

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
To take it into the center of the world

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
To take it into the center of the world

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
To take it into the center of the world

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
To take it into the center of the world

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
To take it into the center of the world

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
To take it into the center of the world

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
To take it into the center of the world

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
To take it into the center of the world

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
To take it into the center of the world

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
She's gone real to me

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Whatever and I've done that do

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I oughta have my head

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Except for her

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
She's under

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Twenty-two

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I think I'm closing dream

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Of that you can't deny

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's been long

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Long

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Time

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Is that a wacky hook or what?

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Hey everybody how you doing?

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This is the daily source code

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It is officially still Monday

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
We got back late

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I know I promised a promise to y'all a Charlie today

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And here it is

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But it'll also have to serve us Tuesdays a show

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Since I will be leaving on jet plane tomorrow morning

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Brighton early

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Off to San Francisco

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll never make any satellite windows whatsoever

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And we're back

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It was a fantastic weekend

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I know I kind of told you guys a little bit about what we were up to

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And then we were going away

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And I had mentioned some of the pieces of one

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It might be happening throughout the course of the past few weeks

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And really after Friday's show

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I realized didn't tell you what we're going to do this weekend

112
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So I just left it at that

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And we went to Amsterdam

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The three of us it was really nice

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It was really good to get away

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We haven't been away

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The three of us in our last US trip

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Which of course was in the middle of the

119
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The heat wave in New York

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Patricia and I both got really sick

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We had to skip Vegas

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Went to San Francisco

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Where it rained of course

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It was not the best of all vacations

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But now that Jesse

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Our big dog is gone

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's a lot easier to find someone

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And of course, you know, you just don't want someone else

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Taking care of a sick animal while you're gone

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So it was a little easier first to go away

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And we've got someone to house sitting

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Look after the two cats

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And Svabber

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Our little Yorkie

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Which really doesn't qualify as a dog actually

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And it was great

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So I'll tell you a little bit about that today

138
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Boy, I'm tired

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's just been a whirlwind

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
A whirlwind of excitement

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And it really started with Friday show

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And I have to say

143
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I didn't almost instant any email

144
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It all during the entire weekend

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I tried not to log on it all during Saturday

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
A little bit during Sunday

147
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Because I know that the real rule is

148
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
If you don't want to receive a lot of email

149
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Then just don't send email

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Or certainly don't reply to email

151
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And then it kind of stays within boundaries

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And it really started with the show Friday as I said

153
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And I got so much positive feedback

154
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
A lot of people saying that they are doers

155
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And want to get going

156
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And let's stop talking

157
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's get something cranking

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That was really uplifting

159
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Very exciting

160
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Plenty of feedback

161
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Still of course on the outcome of the lawsuit

162
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And just a whole bunch of energy

163
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Spitting around

164
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But I have to say

165
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Overall pretty positive

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So a very appreciative

167
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Also on the common boards

168
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Or on the comments on at curry.com

169
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's just it was good

170
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It really felt good and I really appreciate it

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Adam

172
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes

173
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What?

174
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You are on fire

175
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You're angry

176
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You're pissed off

177
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I like it

178
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's Derek Miller from the Penn Machine podcast

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Here and that Friday

180
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Delta Sierra Charlie

181
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That man that was awesome

182
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You were just cheesed off

183
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I haven't heard that for a while

184
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Anyway

185
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You know so many people say that

186
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So many people say yeah we really like the show

187
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And you're angry at something

188
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But it takes so much energy

189
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And I don't want to be angry

190
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I don't want to be cheesed off

191
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll just have to say

192
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Maybe we should always

193
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Maybe Friday

194
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We do a thank God it's Friday

195
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Maybe Friday is the show

196
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We just let it all out

197
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
All the shit that was bothering us

198
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
During the past week

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That may be the way to do it

200
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I think I can do it once a week

201
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I thought it for me too

202
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And I just wanted to tell you that

203
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Okay

204
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And suggest that

205
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Maybe you weren't smoking enough that day

206
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You know

207
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's true

208
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That will happen on a Friday

209
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And it does make a difference apparently

210
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Maybe you should do some work

211
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You imagine if I if I didn't smoke during the rest of my life

212
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
How incredibly

213
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Not nice it would be

214
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It is nice when you're when you're common

215
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And mellow as well

216
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Anyway just want to let you know that

217
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And I'm at Penn Machine.com as always

218
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And I just finished listening to that

219
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And now I'm going to go calm down

220
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So thanks a lot

221
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
All right do

222
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No thank you

223
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I appreciate very much

224
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
As I said lots of feedback

225
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Like that came in

226
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'll probably on the plane ride tomorrow

227
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You know the typical nine and a half hour commute

228
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That I make to work

229
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll probably find a couple more hidden in

230
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
In the Gmail

231
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Oh no I won't find it because

232
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I won't be connected

233
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Hmm

234
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll have to do some pre-preparations

235
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Before I hop on the plane

236
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
A couple more that I did

237
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Really in that thought

238
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We're pretty funny you wanted to listen to

239
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Worker Tom

240
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Who's apparently now

241
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Religious

242
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yo pod father

243
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Trucker Tom here

244
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I pray this finds you and your listeners

245
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Well wanted to comment on the recent podcast

246
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
For one one interview

247
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Specifically in regards to some of the

248
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Comments that Ron Bloom made

249
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Ron is right on the money

250
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
When he says it serious podcasters

251
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Need to begin to develop themselves as media properties

252
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Rather than simply someone putting out podcast

253
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And perhaps sticking in the add or two in it

254
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
This podcasters we need to begin to ask ourselves

255
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
How can I help out my fellow podcaster

256
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
How can I make positive contributions

257
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
To the overall podcasting effort

258
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
How can I make the overall listener experience better

259
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We as podcasters need to do whatever we can

260
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
To help out others

261
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That may mean giving a bit of constructive advice

262
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Or it may mean sending out audio files for others to play

263
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Whatever it involves it needs to be part of a collaborative team effort

264
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
There's an old saying if you row your neighbor across the river

265
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You'll get there yourself

266
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
When you help others you're also helping yourself

267
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Oops here comes the plug

268
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm now part of the pod shown network at

269
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
TruckerTom.podshow.com

270
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Tom Tom

271
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Don't stand behind the exhaust when the engine running

272
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What's the MTV bit in there

273
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
All right this week so it's a if those were the only two pieces of feedback

274
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I got there was a hundred more like them just so you know that that's how positive it all was

275
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That was fantastic

276
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So the whole reason for us going to Amsterdam

277
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And this was kind of you know kind of weird timing or uncanny timing

278
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I should say

279
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
With the whole picture lawsuit because it was actually going to be Christina's debut on the catwalk

280
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
At a fashion show in the Akura hotel in Amsterdam

281
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's a pulse filter

282
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Otkutur

283
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And now Christine this is something Christina's wanted to do for a long time

284
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
She actually wanted to be in the show a year ago

285
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But everyone thought she was a little bit too young

286
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And this year well it was finally her turn

287
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
She was going to make her debut on the catwalk

288
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
This is a big show

289
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I mean there's a couple hundred people

290
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You know it's it's just like any Paris or London or New York fashion show

291
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's just as elaborate, extravagant

292
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
As stressy

293
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
As musical theatrical

294
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's it's really it's a show

295
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But it's you know it's short it's like you know 35 40 minutes

296
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But it's these things are always a big to do and all the celebrities come out

297
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And

298
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And I have to say that Christina was very very calm, cool and collected

299
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Although there was a small sudden it was kind of weird on Friday

300
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
About about 25 30 minutes before we left

301
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
There was a short panic of I'm afraid to fly

302
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And all airplanes crash and I'm going to die

303
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And I've been dreaming about this and you know

304
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
This is the kind of stuff that happens with any human being

305
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
With intelligence who starts to grow up and starts to use

306
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Their breath and start to think about shit that we take for granted

307
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And so it took a little bit of convincing

308
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But the fact that you know I have my papers helped a lot

309
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And I said look you know I'll talk you through everything

310
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And really what I noticed is that

311
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's really about all the sounds, the unknown sounds

312
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And even sounds that I didn't know about probably two or three years ago

313
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So now I was very easy for me to say

314
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Okay now we're going on the runway

315
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Now I was going to test the engines now I was revving the engines up

316
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And say oh that sound you hear is the gear coming up

317
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And you wait for about seven to eight minutes

318
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And now the flaps will come up and look you can see

319
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And you know I was just talking through the whole thing

320
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And it really worked

321
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And I was so proud of myself that I was able to calm her down

322
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And get her through that

323
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And I think that it's pretty much over

324
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Even on the way back today

325
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Even she was looking at the flaps you know

326
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And now try to identify the sounds

327
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And it seems like that is a big factor

328
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
With fear of flying

329
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So anyway besides that

330
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Everything else was just was great Saturday

331
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So we went it over Friday night

332
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Didn't sleep out or sleep in Saturday morning

333
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Because I was scheduled to go flying

334
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
With wind commander William in the Delta Shira

335
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Which of course now has the brand new interior

336
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So we met up around 1130 at Laili Stutt

337
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Better known as Ugly Town

338
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And that's in the colder lands

339
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Kind of the mid north of the Netherlands

340
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And it was great

341
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The weather was fantastic for what we were planning on doing

342
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It was like it was sunshine

343
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But it was snowing, it was 30 knots of wind

344
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So it was going to be some good flying

345
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And wow it's like it's a whole different airplane

346
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Besides the fact that you know it looks like an Italian sports

347
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Turn out on the inside with this plush white carpeting

348
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And I've got the black and brown chairs

349
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Really it just looks like the cats meow

350
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It has that new car smell

351
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Like leather and glue and stuff

352
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But also the new engine

353
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Which has completely been balanced

354
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
In flight balancing and all this technical stuff

355
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And it is so stable and you can really tell

356
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I don't have a vertical hold on my autopilot

357
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Only a directional hold

358
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So you kind of have to play with the trim

359
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And if you know what you're doing

360
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You can get the trim working just as good as any autopilot

361
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Almost except it won't take commands from a GPS

362
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But you could even tell how well balanced it was

363
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It was just sticking right where you wanted to have it

364
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And it was total joy

365
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Although it was kind of crazy

366
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
We got a ramp check

367
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Which means you land and you come up on the ramp

368
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And you know there were the cops or the airport police

369
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Or whatever you call

370
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And that had a camera crew with them

371
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Oh my god what the hell is this

372
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And it was one of those shows

373
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Like one of those follow the cops around shows

374
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I thought that's kind of rude when you think about it

375
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You know it's like all of a sudden

376
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Be with just taking cameras in your face

377
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And while you're doing whatever you're doing

378
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And of course we're clean as a whistle

379
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But still it was a little bit of a shock

380
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And boy it was going to be a lot of cameras during the weekend

381
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Because particularly because of the lawsuit

382
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
As I said that the timing could not have been more

383
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Any more uncanny

384
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
There was just everyone was trying to find us

385
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And trying to sneak pictures of us

386
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It was nuts

387
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Absolutely nuts

388
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And so the girls did all their fittings on Saturday

389
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And we just kind of hung out Saturday night

390
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And Sunday I'd gotten an email from the Prince

391
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's funny how this goes

392
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Prince from the Prince Bernard

393
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Actually of the royal family

394
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And we've known each other for a couple of years

395
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And he said

396
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You know once you come over we got a new place

397
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And come over Sunday has some coffee

398
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And it was kind of a surreal scene

399
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I hadn't seen him in a couple of years

400
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And he said he now has two kids

401
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And his brother came over and he has three kids

402
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And his business partner came over

403
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
They have some business in Serbia

404
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
With IT consultancies

405
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It was just fun

406
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Just to hang out and get a little bit of inside dirt

407
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
On the family and what's going on

408
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Just talk some crap

409
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And then got back because the fashion show

410
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Was going to start at five o'clock

411
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And I kind of stayed away from all of that

412
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Because I was just getting more nervous

413
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Not just the fact that Christina was going to debut

414
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
But she had to wear these high heels

415
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Which would just

416
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I mean these were easily

417
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I don't want to say

418
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Seven

419
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Seven inch heels maybe

420
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I was like oh my god

421
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I just had this vision of her

422
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Feeling over or slipping or falling

423
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Extremely scary

424
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But she did a fantastic job

425
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
She really did

426
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
She kicked major ass

427
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Had the complete

428
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Attitude that you need for the runway

429
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
In fact you know

430
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I think she has a whole different slant

431
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I call it the my space attitude

432
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Totally one of those my space pouts

433
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And she's prancing down the runway

434
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It was awesome

435
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It really was just totally cool

436
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And she enjoyed herself

437
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Honestly we were of course a thousand times more nervous than she was

438
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But it was it was great

439
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It was very successful

440
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And she looks forward to making some cash on the side

441
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
She told me

442
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
In fact you know what I was thinking

443
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Since I'm getting everything packed for tomorrow

444
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I have all parts of the studio

445
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Well it's like here's what we'll do

446
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Let's do a little sound seeing tour of the cottage

447
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
On a Monday night

448
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Let me just hook myself up here

449
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Hold on this should work

450
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I've got it's getting

451
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
My my kid is getting better every single day

452
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I've got

453
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You know my microphone set up

454
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
My wife walks in

455
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Let's see do we have this

456
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
This should go

457
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Turn that one on

458
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And hello hello hello hello

459
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Okay

460
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Let's just

461
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I think that

462
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Is it sound okay

463
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Sounds a little

464
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
A little hollow

465
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Let me okay

466
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
There we could dance better

467
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
One two one two

468
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Okay

469
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Let's just

470
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oops

471
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Just go for a little walk

472
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Let's see what's going on

473
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
How many minutes do I have

474
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Before the satellite window closes

475
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Five minutes okay

476
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh you folks on the satellite

477
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Getting a little sound seeing tour

478
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Let's see what everyone's doing

479
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And the whole I thought Patricia was

480
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Hi

481
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Hi

482
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Hi

483
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm wired

484
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Oh

485
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yeah

486
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Hi

487
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I won't explain what I'm seeing

488
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I just want

489
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah

490
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Tell us about what you thought about the show

491
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The show from Christina

492
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Okay

493
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So now everyone knows

494
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah

495
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I told you I was wired

496
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You didn't have to do that

497
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
No we don't have to throw it away

498
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I just want moms impression

499
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
No it's not with what they think

500
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
No it's not

501
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Mm-hmm

502
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Well I was very proud

503
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It was very special

504
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You're talking to my nipple

505
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
She did very very well

506
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yeah

507
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Unbelievable

508
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
With a poker face

509
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Mm-hmm

510
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And they said that she walked like a Chanel girl

511
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
They have a certain walk

512
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Mm-hmm

513
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Those young models so she was great

514
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
She's natural

515
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Thank you very much

516
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Can carry on

517
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'll go find her now

518
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I know what you're doing baby

519
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's Christina upstairs

520
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
In her room

521
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Hello

522
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You're on the show

523
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Just tell me what you thought about the show

524
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000

Your show

526
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
My show

527
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It was fucking awesome

528
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Okay

529
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Are you talking to Owen?

530
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yeah I'm talking to Owen

531
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Okay

532
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Hi Owen

533
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Okay here

534
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What?

535
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
What?

536
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yeah can you hear him? Owen?

537
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Adam

538
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Your girlfriend was a superstar dude

539
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And I see that

540
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Okay I'll leave you alone

541
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I love you dad

542
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You too

543
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Good night

544
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Good night baby

545
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
There you go

546
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You're on the podcast she says

547
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
All right

548
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Oh you're you gonna stay here

549
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
One

550
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
One

551
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
One and a half

552
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Another three minutes

553
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Hold on hold on hold on

554
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What do you mean just go ahead

555
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's not well if you're gonna stay here

556
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Then you have to be on the microphone

557
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Okay

558
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm cleaning my face

639
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
No

640
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
No

641
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
But it's coming my friend

652
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Comister blogger?

653
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yeah sure

654
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Why is that?

655
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I don't know

656
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Really?

657
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
No I am getting to know him a little bit

658
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Do you understand it now?

659
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Oh really?

660
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah

661
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
What do you mean?

662
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
What do you...

663
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
All in the beginning

664
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I don't know

665
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I thought you know when I saw these

666
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
The drawings that he makes

667
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yeah you must hate me

668
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Mm-hmm

669
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
My god

670
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I think I have a figure

671
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I think I have a figure

672
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I think I have a figure

673
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Yeah

674
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I think he's firstly

675
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
He's probably very intelligent

676
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
A lot about politics

677
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And

678
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
But because

679
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Probably because

680
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
His command of the English language

681
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Isn't where he's why he'd wanted to be

682
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The way he gets attention

683
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Yeah

684
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
He's saying really horrible things

685
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yeah

686
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And then once he has your attention

687
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Then

688
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Then he actually

689
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Then sometimes he actually says something kind of interesting

690
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Yeah

691
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Would you like to hear

692
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Okay

693
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Okay

694
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
First thing you have to do

695
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Is raise your right hand

696
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Can put your right hand up

697
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And you're like that

698
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Yeah

699
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000

And say goodbye people on the side light

702
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Goodbye people on the side light

703
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000

00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
EU citizens

758
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It's something

759
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Something about open borders or something like that

760
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I think so

761
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
How are you listening to it?

762
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
How are you hearing it?

763
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I already heard it

764
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
When did you hear this?

765
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I didn't put it on the show yet

766
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
No, but you played it for me

767
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Oh okay, I'm sorry

768
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Well I couldn't remember

769
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
No, I said to you

770
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
What does he mean?

771
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
He said

772
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I don't know

773
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Oh there you go

774
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I still don't know

775
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
What's listening

776
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Spain and Portugal

777
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Finland and Sweden

778
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Already decided

779
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Not to prolong these restrictions

780
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Beyond May 1st 2006

781
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Netherlands

782
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Have not taken decision yet

783
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
On this issue

784
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
But everything indicates that

785
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Unfortunately

786
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Netherlands will prolong these restrictions

787
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I hereby would like to ask people of Netherlands

788
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
On all levels

789
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
In government and people on the street

790
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
To take action and ensure

791
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
That Netherlands will not prolong restrictions

792
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
On a new EU citizens

793
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Beyond May 1st 2006

794
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Okay, again

795
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Dear Dutch people

796
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I am not threatening you

797
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I am just saying how it is

798
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
If you will prolong these restrictions

799
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Now after two years

800
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Review period

801
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
If you will not lift these restrictions

802
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Then you will lose forever

803
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Opportunity

804
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
To gain respect and friendship

805
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Of myself

806
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And of millions of other new EU citizens

807
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Okay

808
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
So they're not letting new EU citizens

809
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Into the Netherlands

810
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
That's right

811
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
That's not the borders

812
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
But there's a European-wide

813
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Lift of that restriction

814
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Which is coming up

815
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
First of May

816
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I guess so

817
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
But the Netherlands hasn't voted on it yet

818
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Well he wants to go to another country

819
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I don't think he wants to be in wherever he is

820
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I think

821
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm sorry my blackberry

822
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Shit

823
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I'm saying

824
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I think he doesn't want to be where he or

825
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Maybe he wasn't allowed to

826
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
To give him to

827
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Maybe it had nothing

828
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Maybe it had nothing to do with the EU

829
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Maybe it had to do with the comments

830
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Yeah, that's what I thought

831
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Maybe he wanted to live in

832
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Do you think he was passport

833
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
There's instead of a picture

834
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
There's a cartoon

835
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
That is just drawn of himself

836
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Maybe that's a problem

837
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Maybe that's a problem

838
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm sorry this is a picture

839
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Doesn't look like he's here

840
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Sumer or later

841
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
At the latest in year 2011

842
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
You will have to lift these restrictions

843
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Because this is EU law

844
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But by then it will be too late

845
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Let me put it this way

846
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
If Netherlands will not lift these restrictions

847
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
On May 1st 2006

848
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm starting to boycott Dutch products forever

849
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Which is like herring and cheese

850
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Okay, no more cheese

851
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Do you want to say something?

852
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
No

853
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Remember

854
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
May the 1st 2006 is your last chance

855
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Dear Netherlands

856
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Dear Dutch people

857
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Ladies and gentlemen

858
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And you, Mark van der Linde

859
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Thank you for listening

860
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
See you in heaven or in hell

861
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
The choice is yours

862
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Do you think he has a white cat

863
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
That he's stroking while he does that?

864
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
No, do you think this is really his accent

865
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yes, yes, yes

866
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
He has his own podcast

867
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Like this

868
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Yeah, and he talks to like CEOs

869
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
He's a big company

870
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
He's a big company

871
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
He's a big company

872
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Yes, no, no

873
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
No, this is him, man

874
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
This is really him

875
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Don't make fun of it

876
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
This is how we talk

877
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm not making fun of it

878
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Okay, this is the way

879
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
This is the way he really talks

880
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So, to anyway

881
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Man, he does not like the Netherlands

882
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And Mark van der Linde

883
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
That's fine

884
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
It's good

885
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It's good

886
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It's separate

887
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
No, no, no

888
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Mark van der Linde

889
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:35,000
You're leaving?

890
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
You don't want to hear Roger

891
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Hello, I've been Roger here

892
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
So, you haven't sent you any messages recently

893
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I also hit to put stuff like that

894
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So, I could have come extracts like a thing

895
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
That's the about me

896
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So, no way that come extracts like reviews me

897
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It's been racist

898
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So, some of my best friends working course censors

899
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And they don't think I'm racist

900
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Anyway, about your satellite repair man

901
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Who looks like Uncle Jesse

902
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I want you to say that

903
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I think he's wrong to tell you how to speak English

904
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Now that you decided to thank you for the rest of our lives

905
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Then I think he's only righty

906
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
He was up to British accent

907
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Now, another most of the words in America

908
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
No, the same is the English one

909
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So, I think he's only a method

910
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And before we start speaking properly

911
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Like the rest of us

912
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
We say tomato

913
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
You say tomato

914
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
We say oil

915
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You say weapons of mass destruction

916
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I certainly don't think he should be using the word charlotte

917
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Because that means a drop of the supermodels here

918
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So, you'd better be careful

919
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
As I've said, he's finally arrested for distributing drugs online

920
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And I've certainly never thought about calling my private parts charlotte

921
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I call mine said Jane

922
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I was wondering if your cousin name at all

923
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Anyway, I've got to go

924
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
So, bye for now

925
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I made a win to be with you

926
00:31:47,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Oh, Rajano, no, I don't have a name for it

927
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Great piece of feedback there

928
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Good to hear from you

929
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It's okay to send your message whenever you can

930
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I appreciate it

931
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I especially like the bit about my satellite repairman

932
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Who looks a bit like Uncle Jesse

933
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I presume you mean from the dukes of hazard

934
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Yeah, that would be PW

935
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Who started this whole aluminum aluminium aluminium tomato tomato thing

936
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Yeah, well, PW has some feedback

937
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Based upon the feedback that I'll play for you right now

938
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It's outside the satellite window

939
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Because we all know he really just wants more airtime on the show

940
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So, and then I'll weigh in with my thoughts

941
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Okay

942
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
At the risk of starting something so endless

943
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
That I need my own theme song and believe me

944
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I don't want that

945
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
To Susan from Grak Radio

946
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Yes

947
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I've been to Italy

948
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Or should I say Italia

949
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I want to Florence

950
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Or should I say Firenze

951
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I've been to Venice

952
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Or should I say Venetcia

953
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I've been to Munich

954
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Or should I say Munich

955
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I've been to Canadia

956
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Or should I say Canada?

957
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
However, I adjusted my communication methods to suit the environment I was in

958
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I didn't change my own personal manner of speech

959
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Now on to Steve Webb who spoke about aluminum

960
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
The element aluminum is pronounced and spelled that way in the United States

961
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
The element, not an alloy

962
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Just check it with Miriam Webster

963
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
In the United Kingdom, a country that has no

964
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Boxite mines

965
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
The ore we get aluminum from

966
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
They call it aluminium

967
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Both the element and any alloy

968
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Check your Oxford English dictionary

969
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
On average, the United States produces about

970
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
3 million tons of aluminum a year

971
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
While in Jolly Old England, they produce about

972
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
300,000 tons per year

973
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
This means that your frying pan

974
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Is probably made of aluminum

975
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And not the identical aluminium

976
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And now on to Adam

977
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Adam, I am just so pissed

978
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
At the Netherlands court decision

979
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
The way I look at it

980
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
If I walked into a camera store

981
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And reached around behind the counter

982
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And grabbed myself a thousand euro

983
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Nikon

984
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And ran out the door

985
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And got caught and convicted

986
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I would wind up in jail

987
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And in this case, somebody reached in

988
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
To flicker and grabbed a thousand euro picture

989
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And winds up only having to pay for it

990
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
If they do it again

991
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It's mind-boggling

992
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'm sorry, my brother

993
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
It's okay

994
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Just go fix some more satellites

995
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Uncle Jesse, it'll all be fine

996
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
The only thing that's kind of a bummer

997
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Is I have not heard one peep out of creative

998
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Comments

999
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Or a professional lesson

1000
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Maybe they have to get the judgement translated

1001
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Or something but come on

1002
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It's been over a week now

1003
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
We could easily have at least something

1004
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And something else

1005
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I think Com extra blogger pointed out

1006
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
That no one has added this to my wiki pedia entry

1007
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Now don't make me go do it myself

1008
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And regarding the pronunciation

1009
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I gotta tell you

1010
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm on the side of the brits with a lot of this stuff

1011
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I mean come on

1012
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
We know where the language came from

1013
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And I live here

1014
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
So yeah I adapt

1015
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I watch East Enders

1016
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It's like you can't help but just fall into the lingo

1017
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
What's crazy about it though

1018
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It's the Madonna

1019
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I've talked about this before

1020
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
It's the Madonna syndrome

1021
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Madge does it all the time

1022
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
She falls into her English accent

1023
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Which you know

1024
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
She's just trying to be a part of the culture

1025
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And integrate

1026
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And she gets, oh man she gets burned for it

1027
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
So severely

1028
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So maybe that's why I'm doing it

1029
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Maybe I'm just trying to poke a little bit of fun at the same time

1030
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
But I really do like

1031
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I like the English accent

1032
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It's sexy

1033
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I need like some

1034
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Husky voice English chick to read the phone book to me

1035
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It'll be nice

1036
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
A couple of things going on over here

1037
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
With the UK podcast scene

1038
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
There's

1039
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
The podcast Paul

1040
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
And Adrian Pegg

1041
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
A couple others

1042
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I'll sent me this information about

1043
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Let me see how I can find it here

1044
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The MCPSPRS license

1045
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And it first I thought it was just a performing right society

1046
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
But actually the MCPS and the PRS together

1047
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Here it is

1048
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
They

1049
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Actually I'll read it from the website for you

1050
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
The PRS collects and distributes license fees for the public performance and broadcast of musical works

1051
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And the MCPS collects and distributes mechanical royalties

1052
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Generated from recording of music on too many different formats

1053
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
This income is distributed to the members, writers and publishers of music

1054
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So it is really the two licenses

1055
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
That we've been talking about when it comes to being able to play license music on a podcast

1056
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And they have come up with an experimental license

1057
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And the highlights

1058
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
are definitely

1059
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Now I have to see if I can find this page

1060
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Damn it

1061
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Why did I

1062
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I thought I had

1063
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Save that

1064
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
So you don't have to go to the website

1065
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Shit

1066
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Okay

1067
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
This website is a little bit funky

1068
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Let me go to

1069
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
To have to go to what's happening

1070
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Then go to news

1071
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Okay

1072
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
So let me just read you a little bit about this

1073
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
News update

1074
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
There we go

1075
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
A little bit about this license

1076
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Here it is

1077
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Came out on actually March 3rd

1078
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
So this is not really

1079
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
As new as I'd like it to be

1080
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
But it's very interesting

1081
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
So they've come up with a scheme

1082
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
The royalty rate for the Alliance Music podcast scheme

1083
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Is everything here is a scheme

1084
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Which is kind of funny

1085
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Because in the States a scheme

1086
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You know is usually negative

1087
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Will be greater of 12% of gross revenue

1088
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Or the minimum fee

1089
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Per track downloaded as part of the podcast

1090
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
The full track

1091
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Will be

1092
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Well it says here 1.5p

1093
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I think that's pounds

1094
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I don't know

1095
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
1.5 half a track

1096
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Will be 0.75

1097
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Oh no, okay

1098
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Now there you go

1099
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So let's see if we get this right

1100
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
The royalty rate for the Alliance Music podcast scheme

1101
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And they have millions of songs

1102
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
In their library

1103
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Will be the greater of 12% of gross revenue

1104
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
That part I understand

1105
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Or the minimum fee

1106
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Per track downloaded as part of the podcast

1107
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
A full track 1.5p

1108
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So that's

1109
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
What's that like 3 US cents

1110
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Or a half track

1111
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Which is less than 50% by duration

1112
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
At 0.75p

1113
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Hmm

1114
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And then it goes into all kinds of minimums

1115
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
So I'm not quite sure if that is

1116
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
What you play per track per number of people

1117
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Downloading if you have to multiply that

1118
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Or that's a little unclear to me

1119
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
But here's what

1120
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Here's the stuff that I really didn't like

1121
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So you have to obscure at least 10 seconds at the beginning

1122
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And end of each individual track

1123
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
By speech or a station ID

1124
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
See and sure that music constitutes

1125
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
No more than 80% of the total length of any program

1126
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Your program has to be at least 15 minutes

1127
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And length don't like that at all

1128
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And take all reasonable steps to ensure that

1129
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
The individual tracks within a podcast

1130
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Not capable of being ripped or

1131
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Okay, blah blah blah

1132
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Makes sense

1133
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
A podcast or shell not

1134
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Produced podcasts that contain

1135
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Recording from a single artist

1136
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
That have more 30% of the musical works

1137
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Blah blah blah

1138
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
That's kind of like the DMCA

1139
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Playing individual track more than once

1140
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
In any single program

1141
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Providing electronic guide

1142
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
To the podcast which contains tracks

1143
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Play it in corresponding times

1144
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
That means no show notes

1145
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Insert any flags or markers

1146
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
That makes sense

1147
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Incorporate repertoire works into advertising

1148
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Okay, so there's a lot of restrictions there

1149
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Which seem to a bit unenforceable

1150
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
But just it seems to be some restrictions

1151
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
12% of gross revenue which I guess is where

1152
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Where I would fall

1153
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I don't think I want to give away that kind of money

1154
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
For the privilege

1155
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It really sucks

1156
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I think let's turn it around

1157
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Why don't you just make it so much easier

1158
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Let me pay you know five bucks or ten bucks

1159
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Just so I can put a track in my podcast

1160
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
That's a much easier way of doing it

1161
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And probably a lot more profitable for everybody involved

1162
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
It's just a thought

1163
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
So there's a couple other little bits in there

1164
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Which did cause some alarm

1165
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Particularly podcast Paul who as you know is a lawyer

1166
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
And somewhere hidden in here

1167
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It said that they were still going to take a look at

1168
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
What kind of license they would be for

1169
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And this was such a contradiction in terms

1170
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Here it is

1171
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Non-music podcast

1172
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Example predominantly speech with very little music

1173
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
We'll be licensed under a new on-demand scheme

1174
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
For non-music services which is being prepared

1175
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
For launch at the end of April 2006

1176
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
So you can take that two ways

1177
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
The way I read it is that maybe there will be a way

1178
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
To just license one song one off

1179
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Not to have to do a you know

1180
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I guess that clearly making a distinction between

1181
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
A podcast, a music podcast

1182
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And a non-music podcast

1183
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
The kind of like the daily source code I guess

1184
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
We use maybe one or two tracks

1185
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So we'll see what they come up with

1186
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
But at least there's movement and the cool thing about this

1187
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Is that it is coming from both

1188
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
License source

1189
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
So for the mechanical rights and the performance rights

1190
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
So that does make a lot of sense

1191
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
But still it seems like an awful lot of money for the privilege of playing

1192
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Well the first thing I do if we could actually license that

1193
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I would completely and totally bring back the hit test

1194
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
That's what I would do if we can do the hit test

1195
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And it stays within

1196
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And if young pull out is willing to do it of course

1197
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
If it would stay within the rooms of affordability

1198
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I would bring that back in a heartbeat

1199
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
So keep in my eye on it

1200
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
There's still no place you can sign up or anything

1201
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And I believe that the guys from podcast user magazine

1202
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Are going to go and see what the complete details are

1203
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So exciting

1204
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Now one last thing about about the bridge here

1205
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
There's been some a talk at Britcaster.com

1206
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Which is kind of like it's a forum for UK podcasters

1207
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Who for some reason feel that they don't get the attention they deserve

1208
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I'll just call a spade a spade in this case if you don't mind gentlemen and ladies

1209
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And I don't know why because I'll tell you there's more Brits on this show

1210
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Then there are any other nationalities

1211
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Seems certainly the last couple of months

1212
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
But Neil Dixon sent me a drop in email and said

1213
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I thought I might draw your attention to a heated and contentious discussion

1214
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
On the perceived need for podcasters to be represented

1215
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
By an official association over here in the UK

1216
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Might be something we'd like to talk about blah blah blah

1217
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Okay

1218
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
So they're actually talking about organizing

1219
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And I will just say I don't think that's a good idea at all

1220
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I don't think we're making a club out of anything

1221
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Ever

1222
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I've never

1223
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I've joined clubs before of stuff

1224
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And it just turns into like meetings and stuff

1225
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
What I think we can do as podcasters and creative and

1226
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And creative individuals very smart individuals

1227
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
If there's a if the need arises I think we can

1228
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
We'll be able to form some kind of task force or emergency

1229
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Whatever we need when we get to it

1230
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I don't I don't think there's any need for it right now

1231
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Certainly now if we're just going to sit around and say oh you know

1232
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
We need more recognition or whatever

1233
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
We need some freaking doers over here who get into the

1234
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Advertisers pants and start figuring out how to get some cash flowing

1235
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I think that's what needs to happen

1236
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Okay

1237
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Let's see

1238
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I had a promo and then two more pieces of comments

1239
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Then they'll get out of here

1240
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Okay

1241
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
This was a couple of folks that I met at the Donna Drew

1242
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Hangout

1243
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
During our Fubore Friday last time I was in San Francisco

1244
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Hello, this is Naughty from Naughtysheets.lipsen.com

1245
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Are you in between lovers?

1246
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Let Naughty and her friends relieve the stress of the world for you

1247
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I will penetrate the intoxicating world of erotic stories

1248
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Which are submitted by my Naughty Naughty friend

1249
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
So grab your charlie

1250
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Set the mood by lighting candle

1251
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Pouring something fabulous into a glass

1252
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
And flipping between the sheets

1253
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
As they take you on a central journey

1254
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Eberotic story telling

1255
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
And Adam

1256
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
It would be great to set up a private reading next time you come to San Francisco

1257
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Maybe Patricia would like to come along

1258
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Mmm

1259
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Sounds really nasty

1260
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
And quite frankly I like it

1261
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Alright 45 minutes already

1262
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Screw the rest of this stuff

1263
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Let's go straight into our last song

1264
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
It's from my buddy Bill Albert

1265
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
The Vlad Meister, the Vladinator

1266
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
It's the Miss Prince, in perfect harmony

1267
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I'm asking my loving address

1268
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
My personality

1269
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
They come out with our mistakes

1270
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
People think I'm out of there

1271
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I see my face when you bust

1272
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I can't breathe out from the world

1273
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
My friend

1274
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And me

1275
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
We live together

1276
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And he perfect harmony

1277
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
And I am

1278
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
When free

1279
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
We live together

1280
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
And he perfect harmony

1281
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Mmm

1282
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Mmm

1283
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Mmm

1284
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Mmm

1285
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Mmm

1286
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Mmm

1287
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Mmm

1288
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Cherry, the rest kind of travel

1289
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
We go over stone

1290
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
We sing in the guitar player

1291
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Look to get all too far

1292
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
What do they live inside me

1293
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
What could they work for me

1294
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
What's up with them

1295
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Find out

1296
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
My true identity

1297
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
They come out with our mistakes

1298
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
People think I'm out there

1299
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I see my face when you bust

1300
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I can't breathe out from the world

1301
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
My friend

1302
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
And me

1303
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
We live together

1304
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And he perfect harmony

1305
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And I am

1306
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
When free

1307
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
We live together
