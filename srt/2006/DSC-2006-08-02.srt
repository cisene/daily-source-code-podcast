1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
This is Soccer Girl. I just listened to the first episode of Shadow Falls and it's scared me

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,200
crapless.

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,720
Delta Sierra Charlie 433

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

5
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,800
I'm tired on a jump mode check.

6
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,800
Dead dreaming of the Midwest and you know what I love the best.

7
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,800
It's coming home to you.

8
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,600
Tell me I will man guess close to you.

9
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,800
Isn't how he holds you?

10
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,800
When all he knows is you.

11
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,200
Tell me I will man guess close to you.

12
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,400
Isn't how he plays as you?

13
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,600
When all he knows is you.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,800
I wish you could not protect your weight.

15
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,600
Backstays you can't afford I hate.

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,800
A weak little on the subway.

17
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,600
I'm out to ever watch you.

18
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,200
Talk about America's two ghosts.

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,000
You know what I love the most.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,400
It's not your where it loose ghosts.

21
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,400
I'm coming over me.

22
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,200
Tell me I will man guess close to you.

23
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,400
Isn't how he holds you?

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,400
When all he knows is you.

25
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,200
Tell me I will man guess close to you.

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,000
Isn't how he plays as you?

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
When all he knows is you.

28
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,000
When the wild is red.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You say you want to stay in bed.

30
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
And when the wild is white.

31
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
You say you want to make it tonight.

32
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,200
You solve it.

33
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
And when the wild is done.

34
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,000
You say you want to have some fun.

35
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,200
I say it's better than I am.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I can say you want to make it tonight.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,800
Tell me I will man guess close to you.

38
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Tell me I will man guess close to you.

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Tell me I will man guess close to you.

40
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Tell me I will man guess close to you.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Isn't how he holds you.

42
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
When all he knows is you.

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,800
Tell me I will man guess close to you.

44
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Isn't how he plays as you?

45
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,400
When all he knows is you.

46
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Tell me I will man guess close to you.

47
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Isn't how he holds you.

48
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
When all he knows is you.

49
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,200
Tell me I will man guess close to you.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,800
Know the hell of warrior sunrise in this grid.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,800
I kick it off with Mark Mulman.

52
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,400
Tell me how a man gets close to you.

53
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,600
Hey, how you do in everybody.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,800
That's right.

55
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,000
It's bright and early.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,200
It is Wednesday morning in the curry condo.

57
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,400
I am going home.

58
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,600
I can't believe I am going home.

59
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,000
It's been three weeks to the day.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No, three weeks and the day.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,200
So by the time I get home,

62
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,200
that'll be tomorrow three weeks and two days that I've been out here in

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,800
in Pod Show HQ vicinity.

64
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,240
And as I said, I'm very much looking forward to going home.

65
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,640
But everyone who's been listening to the daily source code knows that.

66
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,000
Man, I must say I'm pretty darn invigorated.

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,200
Yes, it's been a fantastic couple of weeks.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,760
We've really achieved quite a lot.

69
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,000
That's just from a personal and company perspective.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,400
And I think we've actually had some fun on the show as well.

71
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,920
Although I have to tell you, I'm really looking forward to doing another show with Patricia.

72
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,640
So I'm hopeful and confident.

73
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,680
I'll be able to drag her in front of the microphone tomorrow morning when I get home.

74
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,640
And there's a lot more to go home into the UK for as well.

75
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,400
I mean, there's a lot of cool stuff happening.

76
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,400
Hello, Adam.

77
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,840
And if you can hear me above the den, well, I'm here at London's old court for the great British

78
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,760
beer festival 2006.

79
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,800
And for the very first time, they're podcasting from here.

80
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,280
More on that in a moment, but I can tell you that this morning, I was a judge for

81
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,240
one of the heats of champion beer of Britain.

82
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,440
And before lunchtime, I'd already had inside me seven miles and a bitter.

83
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,160
So it's now gone 10 o'clock at night and I'm starting to feel a bit jaded.

84
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,440
There's a load of people here.

85
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,240
It's great fun.

86
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,080
We've been talking to the organizers of the event behind the scenes.

87
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,360
We've talking to the volunteers that staff the festival.

88
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,240
And we're playing some great podsafe music as well.

89
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,360
So please do have a listen to beercast.podshow.com.

90
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,240
That's beercast.podshow.com.

91
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,280
Thanks again for letting us use the podsafe music network.

92
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,360
And indeed, podshow to host it.

93
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,800
And please, if you back in Britain in time, do come down to World's court for the great British

94
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,960
beer festival 2006.

95
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,000
So cheers for now.

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,560
I'm just going to have one more for the road.

97
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,200
Tough job.

98
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,080
Somebody's got to do it.

99
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,160
Yeah, slange it.

100
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,720
Skull.

101
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,080
Prost.

102
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,040
Lovely.

103
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,240
Hey, dude, don't thank me for the podsafe music network.

104
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,640
Thank the artists that upload all their stuff there.

105
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,840
That's what you should be thinking.

106
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,040
And of course, I'm sure you do.

107
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,080
I haven't listened yet, but I fully intend on getting a copy of the show and listening to it.

108
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,120
I'm on the plane because of course I've got my 10 hours coming up.

109
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,440
My, yeah, it's about nine and a half or sometimes depending on the win, 10 and a half hours.

110
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,760
Now, being here in the condo and you have to know the condo that I'm in is it's a beautiful building

111
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,520
and it has fantastic facilities.

112
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,360
It has a wonderful, it has a movie theater, which I've actually never checked out at all.

113
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,600
It has a swimming pool.

114
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,800
It's got a hot tub or it's got a sauna and it has a fantastic gym.

115
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,200
And every single time I come here, I tell Patricia,

116
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,120
yeah, man, I'm going to get into the regimen.

117
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,840
And I'm going to start again.

118
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,320
I'm going to work out every single day when I come back from the office.

119
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,000
And of course, what has it been every single day?

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,680
I come back from the office and I collapse in front of either my laptop or the television,

121
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,720
or both, sometimes.

122
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,320
And if you've listened to the daily source code before,

123
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,680
you know that Patricia makes fun of my physique all the time,

124
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,160
which of course is exactly what a guy with my physique wants to hear.

125
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,440
And one of the things she keeps on pointing out is that as the years grow on me,

126
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,720
the ass is declining.

127
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,040
And so I was a little bit worried about coming home.

128
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,520
I don't think there's anything I can do about it now anyway,

129
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,840
but I was very worried about coming home and her looking at me and saying,

130
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,040
hey, you look at shambles.

131
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,880
Look at that, you didn't work out at all.

132
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,720
Which of course, you know I didn't work out.

133
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,240
But we have at Pod Show HQ, a fantastic show.

134
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,680
It's the fitness attack with Amy Mack.

135
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,800
And if you haven't seen it, you can just go to podshow.com,

136
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,160
you can search for a fitness attack.

137
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,440
I think it's in rotation on the home page,

138
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,120
so you'll probably see it pop up there as well.

139
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,640
Amy Mack does a 60-second workout.

140
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,720
And she's also actually helping all of the pod show employees,

141
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,160
those who are interested and motivated twice a week,

142
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,080
with exercise at the office.

143
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,960
Which is another thing I didn't participate.

144
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,560
What is it made in?

145
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,000
So I asked for some help.

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,400
And I said to Amy Mack, I said, you know, Amy,

147
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,800
I really need to get my ass back on track,

148
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,000
because, look, my wife is 15 years older than I am.

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,080
She should have a man with a much better physique.

150
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,280
So she says that she has a program for me

151
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,720
that I'm going to start with today.

152
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,680
Today will be the first day.

153
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,080
Now it is a quarter to seven here in San Francisco.

154
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,160
So it's a little bit early, but never too early to start.

155
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,840
Now she said, I needed to have my wireless mic

156
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,600
hold on a second, which I have here.

157
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,040
Let me just look it up, oops, that's the receiver side.

158
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,480
There we go.

159
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay, I'm, uh, how's this?

160
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,440
That's something we just changed the location of the microphone here for a second.

161
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,800
Okay, so, uh, this is the wireless mic.

162
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,120
This is the, uh, the other mic, G, what a difference, huh?

163
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,520
Okay.

164
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,600
And, uh, that's all she said I would need.

165
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,880
So let me fire up.

166
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,480
Episode number one of Amy Max, daily source code,

167
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,200
AcerSize.

168
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,360
AcerSize.

169
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,800
Yeah, don't leave me back.

170
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,120
And this is day one of the AcerSize workout.

171
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,600
For the next 60 seconds, your ass belongs to me.

172
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,160
Uh huh.

173
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,560
To get this party started, I'm going to need you to lay down,

174
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,520
bat on your back.

175
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,440
For each bed and feed eight inches apart.

176
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,160
All right.

177
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,200
Ready for the next part?

178
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,680
Yep.

179
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,000
Okay.

180
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I hope you're wearing your wireless mic or headset.

181
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,320
Yep.

182
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,400
I got to need you to put your arms down your sides,

183
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,200
calm to this side.

184
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,000
Don't just seal it.

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,200
Now your favorite part,

186
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,600
thrust your booty towards the ceiling and make a bridge.

187
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,480
Keeping your knees, hips, shoulders, all in a straight line.

188
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,040
Oh, crap.

189
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,000
Look for two seconds.

190
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,600
Hold it.

191
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,720
You'll slowly come back down and we'll paint nine more times.

192
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,200
Nine?

193
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,640
As you were doing this, you want to make sure your body's on the heels of your feet.

194
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,160
You should feel this in the back of your thighs.

195
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,920
Your butt and your stomach.

196
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,600
Don't forget to breathe.

197
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,320
Keep your stomach in both ways as tight as possible.

198
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,000
We call this exercise the floor bridge and it is one of many that you want to

199
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,600
through to achieve those bones of steel.

200
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,160
Use the side to get more fitness tips.

Potion.com.

203
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,320
I'm going to do listening so if you aren't breathing hard for the next

204
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,200
minute or two, I'm going to know you are doing exercise.

205
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,440
Until next time, as you're saying is.

206
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,080
Oh man.

207
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,440
I didn't feel that in my ass, Amy.

208
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,600
I felt it in my back.

209
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,400
How can my back be attached to my ass?

210
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,760
My assurse eyes muscles.

211
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,080
Oh crap.

212
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,040
I'm dizzy.

213
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,080
104.

214
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,800
104.

215
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,840
104.

216
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,800
104.

217
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,440
104.

218
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,480
104.

219
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:12,800
104.

220
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,440
104.

221
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,160
104.

222
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,800
104.

223
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,160
104.

224
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,440
104.

225
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,160
104.

226
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,480
104.

227
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,440
104.

228
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,160
104.

229
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,440
104.

230
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,600
It's time for the 104.

231
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,120
I'll have moment.

232
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,680
It's not funny.

233
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,800
I actually am dizzy.

234
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,400
All right.

235
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,200
This is a 104.

236
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,760
I'll have moment.

237
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,080
So if you're not interested in 104.

238
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,640
I'll have crap.

239
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,880
You might just want to fast forward about three and a half minutes.

240
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,520
We got to a very beautiful place yesterday at Potio Plus.

241
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,760
We had a lot of reports from people saying that they had one specific page

242
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,160
on Potio Plus that wasn't loading fast for them.

243
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,360
And it wasn't everybody.

244
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,160
It was basically all over the globe.

245
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,520
There were different results.

246
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,600
And what happened was, is once you're logged in my page,

247
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,840
literally would take anywhere from a minute to five minutes before it finally loaded.

248
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,920
This was a problem we've been working on for quite a while.

249
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
And that we finally fixed it yesterday.

250
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:21,600
And since sale moment brought to you by Amy Max Fitness Attack, link in the show notes.

251
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,920
So we finally fixed it.

252
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,040
And there was a call out in the comments on curried.com.

253
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
Actually, not on dailysourcecode.com.

254
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,280
By the way, dailysourcecode.com is going to be the place to leave comments

255
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,560
on the show as I have some other plans for curried.com.

256
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,760
And so I won't be crossposting eventually.

257
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:48,400
But we still have some work to do on the way our blog feature works in Potio Plus.

258
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,720
Anyway, so there was a call out to explain exactly what happened.

259
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,760
And I'll just try and do it the way I think I understand very well what happened.

260
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,680
But essentially, if you look at my page on Potio Plus,

261
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,480
you'll see that it's really several different modules.

262
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,640
And on the right-hand side, you have some recommendations of shows to listen to

263
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,680
new listeners who was popped up channels by new listeners or channels who have just been created.

264
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:25,120
And what we found in the code, and this is really an esoteric type of problem,

265
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:32,320
the hang was actually occurring when the images for the connect or the new people,

266
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,640
the cool people, which I think is three images, was being called for that page.

267
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:42,080
And the way it was being called was actually because we're moving our servers around

268
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,400
and our images servers changing in location.

269
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:50,960
So the developer that built this particular piece of code put in a link to an HTTP link.

270
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,920
And you could have referenced it to the actual directory on the server where the images live.

271
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,000
But he referenced through a URL, which of course is a podshow.com URL.

272
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,360
What's interesting is that three of that we have a number of servers in our cluster for all this

273
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:14,720
load balancing that we need to do. But three of those servers, somehow this is the real issue

274
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:21,680
that had to be solved. Three of those servers were somehow misconfigured.

275
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,680
So when they're actually requesting something from Potio, from their own domain,

276
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,840
for some reason, something was just hanging there for, well, anywhere from a minute to five minutes.

277
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,840
So obviously, we all we had to do was just patch that one line and figure out what was

278
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:43,280
misconfigured with the servers. But essentially, when someone requests a page from Potio,

279
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,480
the load balancer points you towards a certain server and it has intelligence in there and

280
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,320
caching and knowledge. So the next time you go, it's probably going to send you to the exactly

281
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,440
the same server for load balancing purposes. So people who had already had this error once were

282
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,760
pretty much getting it every single time. And it was great, man. I just sat there yesterday,

283
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,240
well, like, five of us were going through all the different scenarios and we found it and

284
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,240
and gosh, darn it, it's so nice to see it load and so fast.

285
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:26,720
Learn something new yesterday, talking about spam. I got an email from

286
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,560
Nick Zitler. And this is something I did not know about Gmail.

287
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:41,200
So to note about Gmail, you can curb spam and such and check this out. When you enter your email

288
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,800
address into a form or anywhere, particularly where, hold on, I just got to pull down the shades

289
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,760
for a second here. The sound is so nice, but I can't quite see the screen. There we go.

290
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:59,360
So you know, let's say you fill out a form to place a comment somewhere and there's a possibility

291
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,720
of the email address mine show up. Here's what you do. You enter, so let's say my,

292
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:13,520
your Gmail address is budhead at gmail.com, just as an example. If you enter in your email address

293
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:20,560
as follows, which in this case would be budhead plus, and then you enter, let's say you were posting

294
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:26,880
on, on the Don and Drew forum. Now we wouldn't spam you with that. So let's just as an example.

295
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:36,800
So you do atom plus Don and Drew at gmail.com and, and, and Gmail, then understands that that is a

296
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:44,240
specific, a specific email address that you use. And I guess then we'll route any, any mail that

297
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,520
comes through that from that particular place with that email address, of course. It'll place

298
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,560
it into your spam folder. So it'll still come to you, but it'll be seen as spam and then it'll

299
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,280
put it into, you know, that kind of breaks down that I think about it. What if I sign up for

300
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:06,080
automatic notification of comments? Hmm. Anyway, Gmail is doing something a little bit smart there.

301
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:11,840
So, you know, I should just paste that information into the show. I don't know if I did a very good

302
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:18,480
job explaining it. Wow, there's a lot of interesting stories. I don't know if you've been following

303
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:25,120
some of the geek talk about Dig and Netscapes new, well, new, relatively new.

304
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,040
What we call, what's it called now social bookmarking site? Of course, Netscapes is a Jason

305
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:37,600
Calacanis is kind of taken a lead from Dig and created his own version of that. I think with,

306
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:44,160
with different different objectives, perhaps a different end game in mind, but it is pretty much the

307
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,880
same idea. But what's happening now? And when I get this story from, oh yeah, from Valleywag,

308
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:59,360
they'd receive an email. It turns out that media companies and media companies, particularly

309
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,320
marketing companies who are hired by other companies to get them, you know, to get them

310
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,840
press and PR online are actually hiring people. So let's say, you have company A and there's a

311
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:19,680
story about you in the New York Times. They will hire hundreds of people to dig these stories

312
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:25,680
to get them higher ranking on the social bookmarking sites. Nothing legal about it, of course,

313
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:33,520
but it is very interesting to see marketers jumping into the space and what does this mean for the

314
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,880
quote, integrity of a place is like dig. You know, this is something to keep your eye on. I'll post a

315
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,040
link to the email that Valleywag received because I think you'll, you'll definitely next time

316
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:51,840
you visit a site like Dig or NetScape, you'll probably look at it with new eyes because you just don't

317
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,920
know any more. Is this really something people dig or is this something that is just being pushed

318
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:02,240
up the chart for a fee? And maybe that's an interesting debate we can have. Is that okay? Is that not

319
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:10,480
okay? Can the the real quote, zeitgeist of a community actually outweigh the long green of marketers?

320
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,000
Would love to hear from you. Send it to Adam at curie.com or please post it in the comments at

321
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,960
dailysourceco.com. Are you interested in psychology and what makes us tick and personal growth

322
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:29,280
in the inner life? In the integration of mind, body and spirit, if so, then you need to get on the

323
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:36,080
couch with Dr. Dave. As he interviews leading edge thinkers from around the broad world of psychology,

324
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:44,480
you'll find the shrink wrap radio psychology podcast at www.shrinkwapradio.com.

325
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,240
It's all in your mind. You should really listen to that Dr. Dave show.

326
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:59,600
The people are tuning in. Extremely popular. I've met Dr. Dave a couple of times and

327
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,400
listened to a show and liked it very much and I kind of drifted in and out. I've re-subscribed

328
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,440
I got the show through pod show plus. There's a lot of good stuff there. And for those of you who are

329
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,960
into what your mind is doing, it's an interesting little piece of your body. We talk about it a lot

330
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,640
on the Charlie. What's going on in your head? You might want to check it out. Trinkwapradio. Was that

331
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,560
Trinkwapradio.com? I believe it is. Still working on the show notes. You've probably seen that I'm

332
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:34,560
no longer posting a long run down. Interesting debate as well about this. Some people never go to

333
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,680
the show notes page. Some will go to the show notes page. After they've listened to the show,

334
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:46,960
which is always kind of been my hope, is that show notes is more like a reference

335
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,800
after you've listened to the show to go. Oh yeah, I want to go check out that song. But of course,

336
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,240
exactly the opposite seemed to be happening. At least for a majority of people.

337
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:09,360
And that ascercise gave me sense. The opposite really was happening where

338
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,560
people would go to the show notes, look at the show notes, and then make decisions about

339
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,680
the actual program attached to that based upon those show notes. And so I'm thinking, well,

340
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:24,560
you know, if that's really what people are doing, then I should probably make the show notes

341
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,840
more attractive, more like a headline. Now, lure you into the program. And then of course, there's

342
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:36,080
a lot of die hards who want to treat at least this podcast more like a weblogg so they can

343
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,680
deep link into specific sections of it. That I don't like. That's like, you know, I just paint

344
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:47,440
the picture and people only want to be able to see the middle piece or the right-hand corner,

345
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,640
you know, that I'd rather you not listen if you're going to do that. What I do hope is that we'll

346
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,080
have ways for and we have some of them, but we have ways for people through a through pod show

347
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,040
plus to actually point out pieces of a podcast and hand off a piece of a podcast so you can

348
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:09,600
listen to the whole thing or go to exactly the point that someone referenced you. But really,

349
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,960
I think I have to make it more of a headline to draw you in. And of course, the trick is,

350
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,160
is at the same time to also provide the information for people who just go there for reference.

351
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,160
So I'm working on it. And of course, this takes something that I don't have a lot of,

352
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:29,040
which is writing skills. Be prepared for some weird-ass show notes as we, as I go through this,

353
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:36,000
this very trying period of my life. The unions are up in arms. When I say the unions I'm talking

354
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:43,040
about after and sag, sag being the screen actress guild after being the American Federation of

355
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:50,080
Television and Radio Artist. The way it works in mainstream media, if you actually work on a union

356
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,760
project, let's just take a television series as an example. If that television, you know,

357
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,240
there's a, there are set deals. It's like a union, you know. So it's, it's all about compensation.

358
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,680
And if that program is distributed in a certain way, you will get what they call residuals.

359
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,280
So if it's actually re-eared, in fact, I did an episode of Swamp Thing once. Man,

360
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,440
I wish I could find that. I don't have a tape anymore. I starred in an episode of Swamp Thing.

361
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:25,280
And to this day, I still receive probably on an annual basis about $2.60 of residuals

362
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:31,600
because it'll, it'll air somewhere on, I think it, air originally on like the USA network or

363
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,440
something and then it goes into syndication for years. This was probably 12 or 13, maybe maybe

364
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:44,720
maybe in 15 years ago. So, so it's old. But, you know, so what happens when a show like that is

365
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,640
eventually sold through the iTunes Music Store, which I always find an interesting contradiction

366
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,840
in terms it's a television program being sold through the music store. But, okay. So you can download

367
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:02,320
it and watch it on iTunes or watch it on your, on your video iPod. Should I be getting residuals

368
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,200
from that as well? And of course, the actors feel that absolutely they should. But this is,

369
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,600
you know, it's still kind of been an experimental period. And, and, you know, obviously,

370
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,560
I think these production companies and movie companies don't want to give up anything.

371
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,600
Oh, crap. You know, it's too bad you're listening to us on serious stars 102 because you

372
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,760
can't hear the rest of this story and the last song that I've got lined up for the source code

373
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,240
listeners. However, specific host hellways coming up next, then we'll bring you Dawn and Drew

374
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,040
American cliche, which is a show that is really popping out. Michael Butler after that,

375
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:41,040
the Frank Truth with the Brian Know, all about the life and times of Frank Sinatra and then

376
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:46,720
East Radio and Scott Siggler winds it up with his patio book adventures between 930 and 10

377
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,080
Eastern Time. And I'll see you guys again. I'll talk to you guys again tomorrow from the cottage

378
00:24:52,080 --> 00:25:00,960
back in the UK. Take care, have fun with Mark. Okay. Right. So, a whole story about who sent this to me,

379
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:08,000
Bill Berger sent this to me. And it's a really long story. But it seems like, you know, we,

380
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:16,720
excuse me, I think we could actually run into a, uh, run into another strike situation.

381
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:25,200
Because, you know, it's tough, you know, if you think that you, that you really deserve to be paid

382
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,680
for every, um, extra sale of a product and if that was, uh, not the initial agreement to go back

383
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:37,120
and agree to new industry standards. And I'm watching this very closely because, uh, if anything,

384
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,840
the work we're all doing together is non-union. And, uh, the main reason is because, you know,

385
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,680
I don't think anyone is, uh, is getting really rich off of, uh, off of the independent vibe yet,

386
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,160
uh, sure, uh, we're making money. Potcha was making money, but, you know, the, what I'd be able to,

387
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,840
uh, finance shadow falls if we had to do it by, uh, the union rules. No way. But of course,

388
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:08,960
those union rules for actors and producers and directors and engineers, etc, are based on, um,

389
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,160
a very rich history of knowing how much money can be made with these projects. And we just really don't

390
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:21,040
know, um, we really don't know yet. So it, it may be a little early for, uh, for union calls, but I'm,

391
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:26,000
I'm hoping that it may not be necessary at all that everyone will be able to, uh, in fact,

392
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,440
I'm hoping that the marketplace will be so huge that we won't even need that. It'll just be

393
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,080
a matter of picking the right projects and being in contact and being in the right communities.

394
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,360
Um, the great example is, uh, is Jeff Smith. I mean, uh, I hope Jeff. Jeff, are you listening? I hope

395
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,760
you're charging people for all this great work you're doing. Um, you know, Potcha was certainly

396
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,480
paying Jeff for, uh, for the stuff that he does for the daily source code and, and for other, uh,

397
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,160
other projects that that we've hired him for. Um, so I, you know, I think that we're going to find

398
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,800
the marketplace is probably going to eliminate the need for that and we can just work on buy out contracts.

399
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:08,880
But I don't know. I really don't know. So it's interesting to follow very closely. And, um, just, uh,

400
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,120
two more things. Well, one, of course, the voicemail numbers. Uh, remember now tomorrow,

401
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,360
we're doing a show with the lady Patricia. So if you have, uh, anything for her, uh, make sure that

402
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:23,360
you get it in as soon as possible. Plus one, 201, 65, 65, 65, 7. That's our number in New Jersey

403
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,080
and in London plus four, four, two, zero, seven, six, eight, one, three, seven, five, three.

404
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:35,600
Righty, Amy Mack. My assur-size is making me burp. Last night when I came home, um,

405
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,040
I saw that in my video channel that I have set up on Potcha Plus, which I believe is

406
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,480
public. So you can, you can watch that channel as well. And essentially, it's the most recent

407
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,480
episode of a number of podcasts that I've dropped into that channel, all video podcasts. The most

408
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:56,720
recent, um, release from Ted, the technology engineering design conference, which is held every year.

409
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,200
And, uh, what was it to think that was Monterey this year? Uh, there was an, and you know,

410
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,400
this really amazing people, uh, speak at this conference. And it's fantastic that they're making

411
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:12,080
this available for the public to watch. Completely sponsored by BMW, by the way, uh, which I think

412
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,440
is done at a really classy, really nice fashion. And I think it's so, so worth the content that I'm

413
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:24,160
getting to sit through, uh, the same BMW, uh, pre-roll spot and post-roll. It doesn't bother me at all.

414
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:31,360
Was a demonstration of multi-touch computing. And I, and I, you have to watch this. I'll

415
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,120
go, I'll put a link in the show notes to this. It's going to blow you away. This is the interface

416
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:44,880
I want for my, for every single computer I use from now on. The idea being, I'll just kind of

417
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,600
try to explain it. But you have to see it to believe it. Imagine, um, um, a large flat screen about

418
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:57,840
the size of, I don't know, two place mats. And, you know, where if, if you have a, um, if you have a,

419
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:07,120
a pen-based computer, like a, uh, what do they call those things? Notebook, not crap, tablet. There you go.

420
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,240
It'll take one touch point. And that touch point is either going to be your mouse or it's going to

421
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,640
be a brush stroke or it's going to be, uh, uh, uh, uh, a pen stroke, something like something like this.

422
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,440
But multi-touch, which apparently is not all that new that of technology, it's just the processing

423
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,680
speed is now quick enough to actually do something with it. With multi-touch, you can actually,

424
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,160
you know, put any number of pressure points onto this screen, which is kind of at a, I don't

425
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:37,360
like a 45 degree angle in front of the, the person who is demonstrating it. So if you put, you know,

426
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,520
all your fingertips, tops down, then all those, your fingertips, all the fingertips would,

427
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:48,160
would actually do something on the screen pressure sensitive as well. So he was showing some very basic

428
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,760
stuff like, um, uh, a lava lamp, uh, and you're actually looking at the screen, okay? So that,

429
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,000
so you're, you're interacting with the screen at the same time, which, of course, is cool because

430
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,800
multiple people could be interacting with the screen. And that was just a warm-up, then he showed

431
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:08,880
what you could do with pictures. And it was like, it was literally like rummaging through pictures,

432
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,520
but really doing it, you know, on, on your desktop and arranging them. And, uh, oh, let me,

433
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,040
let me make this one bigger and let me move the table top a little bit. It, it was, it totally just

434
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,040
blew my mind. And I don't know how far we are from application. I mean, this is how I want

435
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:29,280
cast blaster to work, man. Imagine I could be touching multiple faders and, and, and buttons,

436
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,720
and it would be responding in real time while I'm looking at the actual, at the actual screen

437
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:40,320
where I'm making these commands, it goes so far beyond the mouse and keyboard. And, of course,

438
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,240
you can render a keyboard right there on the screen. And by the way, make the keyboard bigger,

439
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,200
smaller, change the keys around, um, it'll blow you away. That is something I want you to go to

440
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,680
the show, and let's more check it out, because it is, uh, it's astounding. And then last night,

441
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:01,120
uh, after that, as I was rummaging through the most recent shows, um, then I wanted to catch up on,

442
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,040
I, uh, heard, uh, the latest from Transdance. This is a Candace Loopers from Band Tracks.

443
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:12,640
It's got a new show on the pod show, Transdance.podshow.com. It's actually Transdance.

444
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,920
That's good. Just see the link in the show notes. They got permission for this, uh,

445
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,000
PLW summer club mix of group is in the heart through Ioda.

446
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,760
We're now, uh, helping push this out to podcasts. Very cool. Good working with you guys.

447
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,120
Happy to play this as well, link in the show notes, group is in the heart.

448
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,600
Feel free to ask your sides of this, and if you want to.

456
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:53,740
Now, there's something you can ask for size too, man.

457
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,740
Group is in the hearts.

458
00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:02,020
The PLW Summer Club makes, thanks to Iota, the independent online distribution alliance.

459
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,020
So I think that this is a major outreach from Iota.

460
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:09,820
I'm not quite sure how it went down with Canis Lupus band tracks, but he was able to put

461
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,020
a link to the song in the show notes.

462
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,100
So, and he said that he had permission to play it.

463
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,860
I think that we're so close to working together.

464
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:22,580
And in fact, it's so cool because Iota basically has a whole different customer base.

465
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:30,460
They're working for the labels to help promote the independent labels product.

466
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,660
And we're all about labels or artists, doesn't really matter.

467
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,780
We just want people to be able to share this music.

468
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,940
And of course, we also have a purchasing system of the positive music now.

469
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,940
We're not completely rolled out yet as we have a lot of moving parts, but there are a lot

470
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,740
of songs already for sale.

471
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:49,820
And pretty much anyone who specifically goes and requests it through the help desk email

472
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,940
at the Potship Music Network can get it turned on.

473
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:57,660
So, all we need now is just that last bit to make it, quote, pod safe, although I guess

474
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,220
it almost is pod safe.

475
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,980
But, you know, I have no way to report back.

476
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,380
I have no way to report back to you guys that I played it.

477
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:07,820
So, you know, why don't you make an Iota account or something or let's work on it.

478
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,620
Please give Michael Butler a call and try and figure this out because it's cool.

479
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,460
And I really love playing that song, and I thank you very much.

480
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,460
Okay.

481
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:22,660
On my way home to see my girls to hug with my babies, I'm so homesick.

482
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,780
Atamacurry.com, dailysourcecode.com for all of your comments.

483
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:30,860
Remember, 20 is an iPod, will be giving away the iPod to the most original domain name

484
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:36,300
as a registered through any domain name service, but my recommendation is go daddy $6.95

485
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:41,540
since if you use the DSC 3 code upon checkout.

486
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,860
And if not, I'll just see you tomorrow with a lady Patricia.

487
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,860
Take care, everybody.

488
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,860
Thanks for listening.

489
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,860
Bye.

490
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:56,420
Another pod show pod guest, stick it in your ear.

491
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,740
Get this pod cast and more great ones like it.

492
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:03,300
On the high performance pod cast delivery network from pod show and limelight networks.

493
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,380
I love it.
