Delta Sierra Charlie 374.

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,900
The David Head Show is pleased to announce the first in our sensation audio series.

6
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,900
The Adam Curry relaxation tape.

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:38,900
Listen to the soothing sounds as Adam unleashes his calm and serenity.

8
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,400
You're overweight.

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,400
You're fat.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,400
You're only in the free cage that lives in your mind.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,900
Hear the beautiful words of a man focused and centered in his own being.

12
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,900
It's a lie.

13
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,400
It's a fucking lie.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,900
You'll drift in a tranquil ocean of peace and windless calm.

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,400
What is your fucking problem?

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
Relaxation.

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,400
More than just a word.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,400
To Adam it's a state of being.

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,400
It's a fucking word.

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Okay.

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
It's a word.

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
And how does he do it?

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Because I switched it off in my brain.

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
I think, ah, well, whatever.

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
To achieve this state of perfect peace.

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,400
You must ask yourself these five questions.

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
Do I take it up the ass?

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Who would I fuck?

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Who would I kill?

30
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Who would I marry?

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Why haven't Keith in the girl been signed a pod show?

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
Let's explore.

33
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,400
Lesson one.

34
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,400
Adam's key to breaking from your hectic life.

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,400
If you keep getting stuck in this stupid bullshit,

36
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,400
you'll never get anywhere.

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
Lesson two.

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
Adam teaches health sensuality.

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,400
Can be brought about by sexuality.

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,400
I've explored all the limits of my sexuality.

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
I know where I stand.

42
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
I'm very comfortable with where I stand.

43
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Not afraid to talk about it.

44
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,400
I've had my ass kissed in a sexual fashion.

45
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,400
I really didn't enjoy it and explore your own sexuality.

46
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Explore the parts of your own body.

47
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Some parts are worse.

48
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Some parts are better.

49
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
Some parts are...

50
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Hmm, kind of...

51
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
That's the way it goes.

52
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
Lesson three.

53
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Learn the art of touch.

54
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,400
And how it can ease the senses.

55
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,400
It's beautiful when men hug.

56
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
It's beautiful when women hug.

57
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
And kids.

58
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
And cuddle.

59
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
And make love.

60
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
And have sex.

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Lesson four.

62
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Look not only to the good and peace in your own life.

63
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,400
But also to the world around you.

64
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
Look at the world around you.

65
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,400
There are kids who are killing themselves.

66
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,400
Young girls are starving themselves to death.

67
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,400
We have hundreds of thousands of kids who are fucking homeless.

68
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,400
By the final lesson, you'll be so empowered.

69
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,400
You'll feel as if you could take over the world.

70
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
Oh yeah, yeah.

71
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Oh yeah.

72
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
I'm afraid you're going to take over the world.

73
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,400
Even after you listen to the entire series.

74
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
Who make you feel so at peace?

75
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,400
This is if you hadn't listened at all.

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
You didn't listen to it.

77
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Okay?

78
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,400
You didn't listen to it.

79
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Okay?

80
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Nothing more.

81
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
Nothing less.

82
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Go back and listen to the show.

83
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Prepare to be led in the journey of your psychic path.

84
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,400
What right do you have to call anyone a psychopath?

85
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
What right do you have?

86
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Why does Adam take the time to teach others his method?

87
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Because he cares.

88
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,400
I don't care about anyone.

89
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
What they say.

90
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
What they do.

91
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Who they have sex with.

92
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
How they have sex in their private lives.

93
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
I don't care.

94
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Johnson, a prominent Swedish doctor who deals with sleep disorders says this.

95
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Adam's lessons on relaxation do a great deal to shed light on the issues in this community.

96
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
Wow.

97
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
That's the community.

98
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,400
I got to grow up in without asshole.

99
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
I'd shut up about it.

100
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
You better believe it.

101
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
By the end of this series.

102
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,400
You're not only no more about yourself.

103
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,400
But you'll know so much more about Adam Curry.

104
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

105
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
I'm sorry.

106
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Now I'll sudden you know all about me.

107
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
You know what I've been through.

108
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
You know my life.

109
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Adam would not only make you feel relaxed.

110
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
He'll make you feel special.

111
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
All of a sudden you're fucking special.

112
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
No way, mother fucker.

113
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
You're not special.

114
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,400
If you find that the Adam Curry relaxation tape helps you.

115
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Please, right to him.

116
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
And let him know.

117
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
You want to hear from you.

118
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
One paragraph, not a long email.

119
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,400
One paragraph, the Adam Curry relaxation tape.

120
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
Get some sleep.

121
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Get some peace.

122
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Get some perspective.

123
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Get some perspective.

124
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
All right.

125
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
I'm done with this.

126
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
I've nothing left to say.

16 million dollars worth of airplane strap to my ass.

129
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Do the next generation radio content in my ears.

130
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,400
We don't need no sticking trees.

131
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,400
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

132
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
I'm fasting.

133
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
It's so curry.

134
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
We have clearance clearance.

135
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
Roger, Roger.

136
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
What's our vector, Victor?

137
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
How are you?

138
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
How are you?

139
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
How are you?

140
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
How are you?

141
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
That's a clearance over.

142
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
Over.

143
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Roger, Roger.

144
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Almost to lovely.

145
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,400
I'll say it to you again.

146
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Almost to lovely.

147
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,400
You want to grow from my friend.

148
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Well, you said you'd say goodbye.

149
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Just try and prove you right.

150
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Was I wrong?

151
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Tell me I'm on it's gone wrong.

152
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
You're nothing.

153
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
I'm wrong.

154
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
You tell me I'm lost.

155
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
I'm gone.

156
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Say you belong.

157
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Go.

158
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Almost to lovely.

159
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Baby, I'll go.

160
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,400
Baby, you've been there.

161
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,400
Baby, you've been there.

162
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Baby, you know.

163
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Baby, you know.

164
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Here's a preaching.

165
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Here's a preaching.

166
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Looks like a hole.

167
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,400
And you never said it was a pleasure

168
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
when I served with it.

169
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Just so I thought it was wrong.

170
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,400
It wasn't you.

171
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
You rewronged me to myself.

172
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
And I knew this was wrong.

173
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
I'm done.

174
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
I'm done.

175
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
I'm done.

176
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
I'm done.

177
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,400
I know the more leaders

178
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,400
The more I hate my head taller.

179
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Oh, Mr. Lovelay, I'll say yes to you again

180
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Oh, Mr. Lovelay, you want to grow my friend

181
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Well, you're active in the middle and can't wait

182
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,400
It's a slave in the morning, it's a sworn in prayer

183
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,400
There's no sin in the ring, there's no love in the day

184
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Oh, man, Mr. Lovelay, Beth Thorne Lee

185
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
On your daily source code, it is

186
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
What is it? Wednesday, coming to you from Curry Cottage

187
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,400
In the affluent suburb of Syria, Gilford and Surrey

188
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Man, I love that song, Beth Thorne Lee

189
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,400
She's from California, she's from LA

190
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
And apparently a lot of her songs have been heard

191
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,400
in TV shows and films and now on the pod save music network

192
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,400
God, that was just an actual, you know, when I'm playing a song on previewing it

193
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Patricia walks in and says, hey, then you know it's got something going on

194
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,400
It's Patricia approved, the only thing though

195
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,400
The only thing I felt this song was missing

196
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,400
Oh, man, you know what it is, come on, it's clearly

197
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
He needs a little bit of cowbell

198
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Now watch it kick it

199
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:15,400
And now I'm feeling extremely bad because I forgot who gave me the cowbell

200
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Was it Paul? Was it Neil? Oh, man, I feel bad now

201
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Oh, yes, that by the way, it was not a mistake, I played that song

202
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
I got a recommendation from Douglas Pilgrim

203
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,400
And when he sent that to me and I played the song, I recalled and he

204
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:35,400
He played the song on his perfect head addition of digital flots

205
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,400
And thanks Doug or Pilgrim as you call yourself for doing that

206
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,400
You know, I've put on a pop filter

207
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
It's not even this isn't enough for the plopping

208
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,400
I do. Basically it's a professional version of a wire coat hanger

209
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
With a pantyho strapped over it

210
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
It's a double sided

211
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,400
And probably 300 Dernier

212
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
So hopefully the plopping should be a little bit less

213
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,400
Okay everybody, so sorry about yesterday, no show

214
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
But it was absolutely impossible. I knew that was going to happen

215
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Which of course will tie writing to our long versus short

216
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,400
Five or three days a week conversation coming up in a bit here on the daily source code

217
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Because we were in the city pod show in the city

218
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,400
On a mission seeing if we can get all the right partners lined up

219
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
And really of course podcasters are our partners

220
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,400
But we need a distribution partner or we need to kick you know kickstart some advertising

221
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Or preferably a combination of both in order to get it going

222
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,400
Because we just don't have enough pod show money in the coffers

223
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
To fund a rollout

224
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,400
In the UK without you know some form of cash flowing in

225
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
Or at least some opportunity of cash flowing in

226
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,400
So we were pound in the street got up at 615

227
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,400
We met at 715

228
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,400
And we were off and I don't want to tell you it's just not appropriate

229
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
For me to tell you the people that we met

230
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
But we did meet with potential distribution partners

231
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
We met with the potential

232
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Partners in advertising

233
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
And it was just it was great

234
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
It was a lot of fun

235
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
It was great meeting

236
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
All these different people

237
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
And what's kind of cool

238
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
You know this does fit into our

239
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Brits versus yanks

240
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
And that's not really a versus because

241
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
You know we all kind of stem from the same place

242
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
But you know there is a definite cultural

243
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Brits versus yanks thing

244
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
And it's so apparent to me

245
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
That we love each other

246
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Who you really do

247
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Even though we crack joke and I actually I'm in the middle

248
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
So I don't do it in fact when

249
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
When either Ron or Chris would make a joke

250
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Usually about the language

251
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
And that would only be the three of us

252
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,400
And I found myself saying hey you know

253
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Chill out come on

254
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
And vice versa I can totally you know

255
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
I hear all the jokes on TV

256
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
In fact I seem to be noticing more of them

257
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Maybe just because I'm paying attention to it

258
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
But

259
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
You guys love us for certain things

260
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
And we love you guys for certain things

261
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
And personally I just got to say

262
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
I love living here

263
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Even though it's not the amount of it's not 100% of my time

264
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
You know we do have kind of a

265
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Well we definitely have a home base

266
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,400
And seem to be shooting some route

267
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Our daughter is shooting route

268
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Oh man I should get her to speak some some

269
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Speak some English on the show you'd be amazed

270
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
She can do at least five different accents

271
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Most of them based upon little Britain

272
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,400
But she can and a lot of what she hears at school

273
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
And she can do her you know her regular

274
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Called regular American accent she can do Dutch

275
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
She can do flimish

276
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
But really when she's talking to her girlfriends

277
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Like I wouldn't know I wouldn't have no idea that she wasn't born and raised here

278
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,400
But I'm digging it and London is so pretty even though even it rains

279
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,400
It doesn't matter and there's a lot about it is called it's about the people it's about

280
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,400
And I think this is directly related to media

281
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Excuse me because I think that a huge commercial

282
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Media landscape the way it exists in the United States is probably not very good for the public health

283
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:11,400
You know and there's and by the way NPR and public radio and public television

284
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,400
That's just an I think just another version of commercialism it works in different ways

285
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
And I don't think we have to get in a whole conversation

286
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,400
But you know whether you call it sponsorship underwriting whatever

287
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
It's it's all commercialized and it's understandable

288
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,400
And yeah you go on your

289
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,400
On your listener drives but a lot of the money is coming from big corporations

290
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
It doesn't matter

291
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,400
I think that what we have here in the UK is pretty darn special

292
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:41,400
We still have a culture of listening and because the the network the radio and television network spawns the entire island

293
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Which is 60 million people by the way

294
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:53,400
There is still a lot of you know cultural communal listening and watching going on where you know people in the south of the country are hearing the same

295
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:59,400
At the exact same moment as people in the north of the country and and that is a pretty important community aspect

296
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,720
Something that we really don't have on radio in fact, you know, I was a part of that

297
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,880
We did have some kind of a national radio

298
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,920
It's still done a lot with syndicated satellite shows where local stations will pick up a feed

299
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,680
I did a show called hit line USA which was on it was a lot of stations

300
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,400
It was like two or three hundred stations across the US so we had pretty good coverage and it was a calling show

301
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,440
With with an artist and we'd always have a band or an artist and they met a lot of really cool people

302
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:33,800
Last in an hour and I have co-hosts in Los Angeles not being New York and so it was really good to field all the questions and

303
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,280
And have you know really a community of listeners the bummer of course is that

304
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,520
Whether you're on podcasts or whether you're a stream or whether you're live television or live radio

305
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,000
You still all got to kind of do that at the same time to make it work

306
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,680
So I have a feeling that

307
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,480
That we may just

308
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,480
Really settle down here

309
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,840
Like for good for good and what is forever and what is for good, but

310
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,400
Yeah, like in it a lot and of course

311
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm in a very fortuitous position to be able to

312
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,680
Be in America a lot and I thoroughly enjoy as you know

313
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,000
There's a lot of things about the United States that I enjoy

314
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:18,040
Something that I'm enjoying immensely has been watching the tally of the bitties

315
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,760
the Lasivius bitties

316
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,120
Walk their sponsored walk for multiple sclerosis

317
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,680
CC Chapman joined in

318
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,800
Check this out they were hoping to raise $10,000 by

319
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,040
Requesting for donations on their podcasts both on the bittie cast

320
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,440
Of course an accident hash

321
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,840
We've talked about it here on the source code there are many other podcasts who purchase who put to part of the

322
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,160
Hey participate it in it

323
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,200
But check this out they raised a total of over

324
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:55,640
$22,000 and I asked specifically and yes, most of this money came from people listening to the podcasts

325
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,400
That

326
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:05,320
blows me away in just a years time when we raised $1500 for Lee Wilkins and is his lovely girlfriend

327
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,480
Jenny to get their dogs out of

328
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,360
You know basic isolation imprisonment

329
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,040
Which happened very quickly as well now we're up we can get we can raise $22,000 this is fantastic and thank you everybody

330
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,400
Who participated whether you walked whether you

331
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Told other people about it if you're

332
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:31,720
able to donate money yourself. It's just that's great and and kudos to the bitties and CC for really driving that

333
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,480
It's what power what power remember training wheels people. This is just training wheels

334
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,440
All right, let me hear you with a promo here

335
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,560
Who knows what you should expect from midlife menagerie?

336
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,800
This is not a show about nothing but it's not a show about anything in particular

337
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,720
Nor is it a show about everything a guy has to draw the lines somewhere, right?

338
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,280
I'll talk about interesting stuff I'll tell him using anecdotes

339
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,840
I might review a movie or a restaurant and I'll play music that I like

340
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,960
And if you're a middle-aged Midwestern guy with very tastes you'll probably like it too

341
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,000
And if you don't well then maybe you're weird

342
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,360
tune in it just might not be awful

353
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,840
this program and

354
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,200
I kind of gave you two choices purposelessly

355
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,840
Because I didn't I didn't want to really preset and you give you any preconceived notions

356
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:25,240
I said would you rather have five short shows one each day of the of the week of each day of the week work week or

357
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,360
Would it be okay if we did three longer ones?

358
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:37,080
And I so I didn't say how long I didn't say how short which is pretty interesting because what people find long and short is also very subjective

359
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,160
I did ask specifically for listeners to send in feedback and thank you very much

360
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,560
Most of the feedback I got was from listeners although also many from friends acquaintances and of course podcasts

361
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:53,080
Which is totally valid. I just wanted really I just wanted to I said that so that people would identify them

362
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,120
selves as a listener so I can put some perspective into the survey. It's all very very scientific stuff of course

363
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,640
overwhelmingly people want

364
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
five shows a week and

365
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
overwhelmingly they feel that they should be

366
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,720
About 40 minutes that's the average most people said under an hour

367
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:19,720
But the the number 40 came up very very often it seems to be a perfect time and it's kind of logical when you think about it

368
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:26,600
That you know if you think about a commute which could last an hour or a commute that's maybe half an hour

369
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,840
how you can actually

370
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Massage the cast into fitting into your commute maybe you start just before you walk out the door and then you finish while you're you know

371
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,400
You're right enough the elevated to work or if you have an hour commute you might fiddle around a bit

372
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:48,840
And of course if you know, this is all based upon the original time of Dave winters walk which was 40 minutes and it just seems to be kind of a human clock thing

373
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,800
So a couple of you said yeah, you know

374
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:59,880
Make them as long as you want that definitely makes sense now. You know I do have one specific time restriction which is the satellite window

375
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,240
You know, order to get as many different pod show

376
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,640
Podcasts and then not all pod show podcasts actually on to serious

377
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,000
We've chopped it up into bits. We only have four hours. So what you're listening to now and stars

378
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,240
102

379
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,840
Only last 24 minutes and 30 seconds and then there's all kinds of I think this commercials and stuff and promos and what have you

380
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,960
In order to fit all the other stuff and sometimes I do 49 minutes which would be two half hour blocks

381
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,680
PW and I do that sometimes just to shake things up or just to you know

382
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,080
She switched stuff around make it a little fresh put some excitement into the into the lineup

383
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,520
But it typically it's 24 30 and this isn't that there's nothing I can do in 24. I can't finish

384
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,600
I just can't finish enough of what I want to do so it has to be more than 24 minutes and think about it

385
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,480
You know you've got a song it today. We had that great opening bit

386
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,960
The relaxation course. I was four minutes and ten seconds. You know, so before you know it with the

387
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:02,200
What is it what's missed to lovely? Mr. Lovely's another good form. It's just like eight or nine minutes gone, so that's almost half the show

388
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,280
you know

389
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:10,920
That alone I want to play a longer audio comment. So I think what I'll so obviously it's done when I'm done

390
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,800
But I think I should try and keep it

391
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,920
Definitely five days a week. There is hardly anybody who said

392
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:23,320
Give me three everybody wants it to be daily and they also of course feel that it shouldn't be called daily source code if it's not daily

393
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,880
Jamie says Monday here in second life or

394
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,840
High May I guess depending on

395
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,080
Your pronunciation. I like the daily source code to be daily

396
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,160
anywhere from

397
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,640
24 and a half minutes the satellite window to an hour

398
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,040
But definitely every day

399
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:45,720
When you're at the college I get them in the morning usually and it's great via the i-trip via fm in the car

400
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:52,280
And when you do it from the condo, it's usually afternoon in the home office when I listen I'm in the US Eastern time

401
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:59,240
So you know what Adam do him whenever he can for as long as you want just do him. I need my daily source code

402
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,400
Jack Elias get jacked dot hontemus dot com

403
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:10,040
Okay, so that was from my podcast or but I also got some interesting feedback from a listener not from the US by the way

404
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,640
Which also made a difference in my survey?

405
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,920
Hi Adam this is how you're from Mexico City

406
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,040
Well on DSC 333

407
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,280
You're saying that you like to receive a feedback from

408
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,960
listeners

409
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,920
Especially those of us that doesn't have a podcast

410
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,200
So I said hey, that's me

411
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,640
So this is my contribution for you and

412
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,280
Well, I wanted to

413
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,680
Comment a couple of things one of them was

414
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,480
Regarding the length of the show for me

415
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,440
Appesiate not very long shows

416
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,440
Especially since I try to listen to as many podcasts as possible, but

417
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,760
When you have a show that lasts more than an hour, man

418
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,520
It's it's difficult to do that and

419
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Sorry, it's rather small texting here and

420
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,920
Yeah, I would appreciate if you make a

421
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,560
shorter shows

422
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,560
Maybe I don't know for a minute. It's a very good standard and

423
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:22,040
Well we understand that maybe sometimes you will have to make shorter shows sometimes

424
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,200
Longer shows okay

425
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,920
Exceptions can be made that's that's not problem

426
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:33,640
But if you aim to to maybe for the four minutes will be really would be nice

427
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,600
Um, all the things that you said

428
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,800
Regarding the feedback from listeners

429
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,720
Especially for the I would say the technology impaired

430
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,080
Man, God did switch it and all that stuff

431
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
I don't think that's the easiest way

432
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,040
I was thinking maybe you can do what others do

433
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,160
Which is to have some hotline

434
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:07,640
So the listeners can't call at any time and you don't have drums

435
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,320
So you you have you can have a voice mail system

436
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,240
Maybe like Skype so

437
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,840
Even you can have a number in the US another number in the UK

438
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,320
So depending where your listeners are can call to the number which is

439
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,280
Communined for them

440
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:39,800
And give you a message the rest of us that which are not in the US or the UK

441
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:46,520
Maybe can call by a Skype and I think that will be a very easy way to give you

442
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,240
All the feedback

443
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,880
Well some ideas that may help you

444
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,800
Well just to let you know that there's a listener who doesn't have a podcast

445
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,920
Right here in Mexico City that tries not to miss a show

446
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:14,200
What it's been a good talking to you and well take care and hope to keep listening about you

447
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,000
Best regards have here for Mexico

448
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,040
Bye bye right on have you well thank you very much for number reasons first of all because you confirm the

449
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:28,920
The whole concept of it being daily and around 40 minutes and if it's longer shorter that's okay, and I took your advice

450
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,000
And we've got a phone number

451
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
We have in the states

452
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,680
201 625 635 7

453
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,960
when the UK

454
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:45,160
020 7 6 8 1 3 7 5 3 satellite folks on 102. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Okay

455
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,400
So I've actually had those no had both those numbers for a while

456
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:57,080
It's a J2 connect or something whatever which I've always found to be quite reasonably useful in the past because it'll actually email me

457
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:05,800
The audio file as soon as it's recorded which now that I like there's another part that I really like the audio files are in a g in the gsm

458
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,720
Audio format which is very good quality and of course you'll never get anything better than what the phone is putting in

459
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,160
But I've tested it with my own cell phones and stuff and I like the quality of it and

460
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:25,560
The file size is very very small so again the numbers are 201 625 635 7 if you want to call in a voice comment

461
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:32,200
So it saves me in my Gmail inbox it saves you the hassle of having to record something if you don't know how to do it

462
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,560
And of course if you want to do something like Matt and Dave did with a pre-produced bit, you know that the we you know how to get it to me

463
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:44,680
Why the 201 number because I'm from Jersey of course 201 625 635 7 in the UK

464
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:50,280
That's a plus four four so the UK country code if you want to dial from somewhere else

465
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,120
the number is 020 7 6 8 1

466
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,680
375 3 and then finally on this topic because I don't want to dwell on it too long

467
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,520
Something that is also quite important as Tristan

468
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,760
Ppo or Ppo pointed out

469
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,920
Hey man

470
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:13,240
My car iPod adapter has been knocked out of commission and your shows are getting a bit too long to burn on a CD

471
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:19,640
In the future if you could take some pity on those with broken car adapters and make the show small enough to fit on a CD

472
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,240
One hour 10 to 15 minutes would be great. Thanks. Yeah, you know what I'm also someone who often does that

473
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,720
I'm a way to the if I'm my one my way to fair Oaks or oh one second

474
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,480
We've got a red dash out from message in three parts who's sending in

475
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,320
Okay

476
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,680
Oh, it looks like this is a from P to digital flot some server appears to be down use and it gives me a different

477
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,600
email address to use

478
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:55,080
To tell me when Charlie is up problem A involved all of West Coast pod show is slow too. Hmm. I don't know if that's a network thing or if that's a

479
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,960
Pod show thing

480
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:04,200
We're getting into that area, you know, as we we started to bring I think today we we bring the developers in

481
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,600
They all have some kind of info in their email box more about that on the devcast devcast.podshow.com

482
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,640
But there could actually be something just whacked out on the west coast. I've seen that happen before and God remember

483
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:23,640
Back in the day in the in the late 80s early 90s this happened all the time. Oh, someone put a backhoe through

484
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,480
some fiber near Virginia the entire eastern seaboard is down

485
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:34,360
Oh, yes, the good old day. So yeah, but I'm also a guy who will you know take off for the airfield and I'll burn a

486
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,920
A show onto a CD and take it with me. It's I really become accustomed to that, you know

487
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:44,840
I I always have a stack of CDs and a felt it magic marker always right down what's on the CD by the way

488
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,280
I'll you'll be sorely disappointed or you could get a CD

489
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,160
CD rewriteable of course if you just want to have one one for the daily source code whatever

490
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,160
So yeah, I am I am sensitive to that as well. Although I must say the burner in my Mac

491
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,240
It'll say it won't fit on one CD so we put it on two so that's not bad

492
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:08,760
So okay, so I guess we're going to keep it around 40 minutes, which I don't think I'm going to make today either, but there's so much cool stuff to do

493
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,640
You'll back to that bridge versus yanks

494
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,040
um

495
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:19,080
I find British women as an American speaker for something about it, but

496
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:28,040
It's fun to flirt with with British women and it works really well if you have an American accent and it's and to me

497
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,120
It's it's really sexy to flirt with with English women

498
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,920
It's something that's something about it

499
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:42,520
Has anyone else noticed this? I know there's a lot of Britian combos a couple of them at the the drafts and darts meet up we had

500
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,640
Maybe it is maybe it is the line maybe we just find each others

501
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:55,960
Accent very sexy for very different reasons and I can't really pinpoint what it is, but maybe maybe British women are just

502
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,480
Flirts I like it though don't stop

503
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Okay, what do we have here oh yeah

504
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,240
Mark Smith I just wanted to

505
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,520
Read a bit of his email here

506
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,120
He says really nice to see surface

507
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,160
To see surface you're interested in what listeners are thinking especially in your last couple of shows

508
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,800
I'm a listener having for a long time since listening to your show

509
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,120
We nearly got your laptop swipe by some teenagers down at the BBC. Oh, wow

510
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,520
That is a while ago. That was a fun that was a fun day

511
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:34,040
I got myself down to the draft and darts after new the brick layers on Sunday not really knowing what to expect

512
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,920
They had a great time

513
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:40,840
I hadn't gotten myself a name stick and at some point in the afternoon someone I was kind talking to kindly made me

514
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,040
Made me one with a word for your on it. Yeah, I remember you

515
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,920
It wasn't done to be nasty or anything in fact at the time

516
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,400
I found it quite amusing. It's funny though as the afternoon progressed

517
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,880
I realized that the word voyeur did actually encapsulate in some way how I felt

518
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:59,320
It's a very weird thing to know such a so much about a person from listening to their shows yet

519
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,640
They know nothing about them. I would have I would have said hi and had a chat

520
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,040
But what on earth do you say to a person to whom you have listened to for nearly 200 shows?

521
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,840
Well, you say hi

522
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,720
Trying to keep the podcast in community a non-cliquey affair. I think is really important. Listen up podcasts

523
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,440
I have no plans to become a podcast to myself but love being a listener and want to be involved

524
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,360
So it's cool to hear you're thinking about this. Thanks for suggesting the gathering

525
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,280
I'm at lots of really interesting people someone which I will meet again, and though no darts were thrown

526
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:36,680
I thoroughly enjoyed the beer maybe I'll see you in second life. Yeah, Mark cool man. Yeah, that's I agree there

527
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,680
Now of course this was a very specific

528
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:44,600
podcast or afternoon. I was so happy that we had a listener there were a couple more people who were quote just listeners show up

529
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:50,200
But it's easy for for us as podcasts to get caught up in ourselves and what we're doing and

530
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,000
And so you know again, this is why I'm really trying to

531
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:02,120
Understand a lot more about my audience about you as a listener and hopefully you'll pipe up once in a while

532
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,560
And phone in on the on the numbers I gave earlier

533
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:12,120
Got another dev cast I'm gonna do today. I just want to bring people up to date if you if you want more of the geeky talk

534
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:18,360
About what pod show is doing. We've definitely moved that over to dev cast as in dector dector

535
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:24,120
Delta actor Vico Charlie alpha Sierra tango dot pod show dot calm

536
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,680
10 golden tickets had been issued 10 have been claimed

537
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,080
We're going to do another round today

538
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,400
For those of you who want a golden ticket

539
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,680
I saw posting from K1 Kevin

540
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
of Strauski on

541
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,200
Well, by the way

542
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,880
Shipman just as as we're getting this thing going his grandmother passed away

543
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:49,160
So he's gonna be out for the rest of the week. We knew she was ill and Kevin had been back to visit her several times and

544
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,920
It's just sucks so he's he's on a plane now and he's he's gonna go visit with his family

545
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,920
I think it's in in Chicago

546
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,400
So I'm gonna try and talk to Aaron

547
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,960
This afternoon or it'll be more like this evening

548
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:08,840
Early early to late morning San Francisco time Aaron is our database wizard wizard dress

549
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,560
I should say I haven't gonna talk a bit about

550
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,600
Well, what she's you know what she's I think she has a very important role everyone has an important role, but man

551
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,600
Data-based stuff that that's not science. Okay. It's sure there's some science but a lot of it is

552
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,040
Art and sorcery and all kinds of witchcraft and Aaron is just perfect for that

553
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:33,240
So we'll be talking to her more tickets to be sent out it again as if you want to go and take it

554
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,280
Sorry, I have a bit of you know what I don't have this in sale. It must be this different coffee

555
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,640
I'm drinking

556
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,040
But she's gonna get some new new pods for me today

557
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:50,760
Okay, so you should have in your email information and we just had to get some some stuff cleared up and we want to make sure everything was set up with appropriate

558
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,720
Appropriate docs et cetera, so look for that

559
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:02,280
And let's just clean it up some stuff here. You know, this is my problem. This is why these shows gets so long

560
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,280
It's because everyone sends me this cool stuff. I don't want to miss out on anything

561
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,560
I did a pretty poor job of explaining what mags are

562
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:15,560
The magnetos, uh, which I thought one was broken when we were on that flight, but it turned out to be a spark plug

563
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:23,080
Well, you know, you can always leave it up to the Charlie audience and then a cha cha head will bring you the real low down

564
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:30,760
Get out of him. This is Peter Bailey a listener from Australia and until recently an aircraft maintainer for the Royal Australian Air Force

565
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:38,200
In Charlie 373 you seem to a little bit vague about magnetos in the ignition system for your aircraft

566
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,440
Hopefully I can help out a little bit

567
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:50,280
Most if not all civilian piston engineer craft have two magnetos each magneto feeds an entirely independent bank of spark plugs

568
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,000
So each magneto feeds one spark plug on each cylinder

569
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,480
That way if you have a magneto that dies in flight your engine isn't going to die with it

570
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,760
When you select for example left magneto

571
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,600
You are electrically shorting the right magneto out and effectively killing it

572
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:16,120
Which leaves you running on one good magneto. That's what you do during a power run-up checks

573
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:24,840
Is to make sure that that ramp magneto that's still selected is going to continue to feed you with enough spark to keep the engine running

574
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,200
Hope that helps

575
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:35,720
Oh as for the duration thing that you're asking your listeners to give your feedback on

576
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,960
Personally I'd like to see it the Charlie kept it around an hour for the simple reason

577
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,480
This is how long I commute for and it's the best way I know of well

578
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:52,680
Second best way I know of of finishing a day's work is to just sit on the train and enjoy listening to the Charlie

579
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,920
There's not a radio show around that can beat it

580
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:03,480
Thanks and keep up the good work cheers. Dude. Thank you very much. See now there you have it from a mechanic who hopefully

581
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,480
No's exactly what he's talking about

582
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,360
Man

583
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,080
Yeah, how about really add something to it, don't you think?

584
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,200
Had a major metro sexual moment I wanted to share with you guys if this is our little corner where we

585
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:36,200
We sit around and complain and bitch and mowing about stuff that we never talk about it face-to-face because well

586
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,360
It's just not naively right

587
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,480
So I'm staying in the Sheraton, Bulgaria via hotel. There's no more spot at the at the luxuries

588
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:49,320
Buckle where Ron was saying in fact Chris wasn't staying there either he was at the at the york club or something like that

589
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,600
And the Sheraton, you know

590
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,840
There's there's two this

591
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:59,160
There's a couple things that really bother me about the standardization of Sheraton hotels one is

592
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:06,040
The hairdryer okay now when I check into any hotel that is costing more than a hundred bucks a night

593
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,800
I expect there to be a decent hairdryer on the premises

594
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,000
If there's anything I hate is that vacuum tube that reverse blows

595
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,240
Luke warm air out into a vacuum cleaner attachment

596
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:25,080
They are supposed to be actually actually be able to use a functional hair blowing device now remember

597
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,960
I'm not just using the hairdryer for blow drying the hair for actual drying

598
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,520
But for styling and it's

599
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,240
It's

600
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,360
Especially the magnets we click it back into place and you can't move around because the tube is too short

601
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:45,800
And then the lights the lights in the bathroom are so bright and of course you can't dim them that you know you're looking right through your hair

602
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
And to your scalp you can't get any idea of

603
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,800
What you're doing so then of course I want to go looking for another mirror and

604
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:59,000
Restricted by the hose so that was just a just a minor little annoyance

605
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:07,000
But because I've been subject to a cold for the past couple of weeks and I have a I have a lot of minor cold just now nasal stuff

606
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,080
I blow my nose a lot

607
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,520
It's been quite frequent as of the past week or two and

608
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:18,120
You know when you do that when you have dirty hands before you know it you can get a little

609
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:27,440
Infection under your skin anywhere on your nose, of course, and that started to turn into a nice little sit that was kind of bubbly under

610
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,440
You know

611
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,440
And here's another annoyance

612
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:35,160
I thought I was going to be smart by jamming only only what I needed into a roller bag

613
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,880
Which man I didn't have my life bag and you know we really are like women guys

614
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,080
You know at least I am I have all things I need in my bag. I've got you know

615
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,080
And acid should it happen

616
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,960
Sometimes it does on days like like yesterday

617
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,080
aspirin but also I have this

618
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,080
Marta gave this to me when I was doing the

619
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,320
Interview for the Spiegel magazine

620
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,040
She gave me this great cover up makeup and

621
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,480
Normally I have that right in the side pocket because

622
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,920
You know, it's if you have a sit. Okay, but to be able to to cover it up just lightly so you don't see it

623
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,880
And I admit for me it makes a big difference with myself consciousness

624
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,080
Particularly when I'm in a meeting and when I have to present stuff and so I didn't have that with me either

625
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,720
So it was not a very good Metro day to say the least hey Adam

626
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,920
This is the rubber head here for a rubber room for radio.net

627
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:33,320
I'm here in the bathroom, which is where all Metro sexual males go to a crimp and prune and prod

628
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,480
Get their selves together about to do my hair and I've got a product for you and

629
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,440
I don't have as much

630
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,800
Lowing hairs you can affect my hair is kind of short

631
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,760
I need it to stick up sometimes and I need to lay just right and

632
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,520
This is stuff you can only get it in salons

633
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,720
Not in a salon but salons. It's redkin fifth avenue

634
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,120
New York City you're rough paste

635
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,840
Working material you know it's kind of like it's not gel. It's not

636
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,120
Moose it's kind of it. It's paced you know it kind of like that stuff in

637
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,160
Kindergarten that you would

638
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,120
Well, I don't get next to you. I wouldn't even

639
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,320
But here's the thing you can't just go to like the

640
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,080
Public's

641
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:30,600
grocery store crubber or something like that and pick up a bottle you can only go to a really expensive

642
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,160
Salon and

643
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,160
I said once

644
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,960
My wife when she was gonna go out of town. I said hey can you

645
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:44,120
Can I keep the rough paste she said no, no, I need that there's only one bottle left and she said

646
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,920
Do you know how much that stuff costs and I said no

647
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,320
$15 a bottle and it's all

648
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,040
Tiny two and it's up and like a week

649
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
You know why can't they make

650
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,640
Stuff that is good and you can use it and be meant for sexual

651
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,920
To our full potential and then have to pay

652
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,760
$15 a bottle. I don't I don't get it anyway

653
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,240
I got to get ready to go

654
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,240
I got to go to work

655
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,240
Hi

656
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,240
Radio

657
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,240
I've been

658
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
Remember head and

659
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,600
Thank you once again first. Let me get that off my chest. Yeah, no problem. Well, I'll tell you why

660
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:37,080
You know what this is why I'm so confident we're going to get a sponsor for the metro sexual moment because

661
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,080
We're subject to the same crap that the women are my friend

662
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:48,280
The cosmetics industry. Yeah, we may not be using it quite as much yet and we may be secondary users by being first

663
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,000
And buyers and passing stuff on but

664
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:57,560
No, no, no, no, that's that is the cosmetics industry for you and you know what we'll get into stuff that we don't want to use

665
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:02,440
Because it's tested on animals, etc. It's said to you watch just stay tuned to the metro sexual moment

666
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,280
In 1775 it was the shot heard around the world and the revolution was on today

667
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,440
It's the podcast being heard all around the world and the revolution is on

668
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,840
Listen to some of the finest podcasts in the world at new England podcasting.com

669
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,120
New England podcast the revolution is on

670
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,360
From America

671
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,360
It's

672
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,760
The podcast with a mission to expose Jesus for who he really was

673
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,440
These guys are awful and we would never do that if we're giving the chance world

674
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,520
Well, Jesus loves some sexuals. I don't want fat people in my club

675
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,800
I would be as much ass as I could in response and I probably wouldn't feel bad about it

676
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,360
Christians prove that they believe in something a little bit weird

677
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,480
Check us out on the web at wTF-wjd.com

678
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,200
This has been your announcer speaking

679
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:11,000
They paid me to do this. I have nothing to do with this guy. Jesus loves assholes

680
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,880
I thought I'd roll that promo out for you to

681
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,960
You know have some different airtime for different perspectives

682
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:26,920
What was it's what thought was Jesus doing show interesting? I don't like the that's so

683
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:33,160
Old fashioned though the old they paid me to do those so I have nothing to do with them. That's too bad

684
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,480
Some I used to say they paid me to do this but not very much

685
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:45,480
So I want to wind it up today with a little bit of talk about second life because I actually spend some time there

686
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:51,240
So it is a part of my life just like my first life is or RL as we say on second life

687
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,040
You know what I've noticed. I've noticed that

688
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,840
Yesterday when I came home

689
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:02,440
I left the sea I was on the five o'clock train from Waterloo to Guilford Station and I called ahead of time

690
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,520
I used to call the the car servers say I'll be there at 530 because it takes about half an hour pick me up

691
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,880
And we were there late because we had some electrical thing that had we had to wait five or six minutes four

692
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,960
So I was there about five forty and the car wasn't there so I called up and I was ready to apologize

693
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,440
But the guy started apologizing to me saying

694
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,520
Oh no no no no I'm just curious really busy and it was it was crazy

695
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,360
I think it would probably take 10 minutes just to get from where a car would pick me up

696
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,000
To go around the station to the stop to the stop light, you know to get back on to the road

697
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,680
So I understand that you know

698
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,320
I understand how it worked with cabs and with drivers and traffic and crap and managing a business

699
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:41,480
We really have too much demand for you always have more demand than cars if you're lucky

700
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,160
So I'm cool with that, you know, but I waited another 20 minutes so by now the cars an hour late and I'm like fuck it

701
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:54,360
I'm just gonna walk and you know why not if you have I've been in cabs all day and the trains and tubes and I'll just walk

702
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:00,280
Which is a good 30 minutes from home, but it was great and what I noticed is that I'm paying a lot more

703
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:06,280
Intention to my surroundings and I am convinced this is because of second life in fact

704
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:11,800
Sometimes I actually catch myself saying oh wow, you know, I should jump on that balcony

705
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:16,680
Very quickly, you know, just a flash. I'm not in total not totally delusional

706
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,080
But architecture is is

707
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:24,280
Starting to become very interesting again to me clothing the people are where behavior is how they walk

708
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:30,040
This is all the stuff that you're you're very focused on in second life and and as I was thinking you know walking along

709
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,520
I'm thinking wow this could be a great educational tool

710
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:38,520
To have kids build stuff in second life when when learning about history and understanding

711
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:43,720
Understanding things like architecture and behavior and you could program that in and these toolkits

712
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:50,360
And become more plentiful and and more easy easier to use and I was just I just wanted to make a note of that that

713
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,600
It's really doing something to my brain, which I am enjoying completely

714
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:05,320
The guys from Lyndon Labs also gave a presentation at Google at the Googleplex

715
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,280
During their tech talks. Oh, man those guys are so square over there

716
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:16,360
I'll put a link to to the Google video in the show notes because it's great. It's cool if you want to because they do

717
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,920
They do the the talk with the two of them and one guy is showing stuff on the screen

718
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,160
Well the other guy's talking and it's cool. You should definitely check that out look for the link in the show notes

719
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,400
data source code dot com and it curie dot com

720
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,680
And Greg Hoffman says

721
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:37,160
Give me a link to a forum on second life. You have to actually be I think a member of second life to read the thread

722
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,400
But he says something something interesting here. I'll just I didn't quite understand what he was saying

723
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:48,040
And I figured if I put this in my in my notes for today, and I talked about it

724
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:54,680
Maybe I would figure it out. So you could put you could put your comments or wait into the discussion on what would be

725
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,600
Doing virtual podcast and video podcast from within second life

726
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:03,720
Imagine getting virtual cameras and microphones and a mixing board then you can control these and then out

727
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,560
Pops and audio or video at the other end and I have seen people do this

728
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:13,320
For me when I think it would be very compelling is a second life video podcast and then the avatars can actually show all

729
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:20,680
The second life gear or I presume anything else that they're doing. I got to figure this out if it's easy to record a camera view point

730
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,680
It probably is

731
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:28,360
The maybe a maybe I will do that. Maybe I'll do a video podcast of the castle which I've now I figured out how to lock it out

732
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:34,440
So the people kept just jumping by and landing on my roof and stuff and you can find my castle pretty easily

733
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,800
It's got a

734
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,240
Whitesacorsky s 76 helicopter on on the roof

735
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,320
Which I bought the other day and that I've been flying around it behaves

736
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,600
Amazingly

737
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,600
Life like I have to say

738
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:54,120
Not in the real controls because if you let go of the controls, you know, it just hangs the hangs there continues on its journey

739
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,880
But without a doubt good stuff in second life

740
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:04,520
Catch you there, right? Oh, there. I don't know she's Barry Burbs from the Burbs podcast, you know, we have some pretty distinguished listeners

741
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:09,560
You know, I got an email about the Burbs. It's a listen to it. Oh, yeah, I really like that

742
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,360
So anyway, I just thought I'd send you a voice mail to

743
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,480
Try and calm you down from

744
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,880
Again everybody excited about second life

745
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:23,240
I'm not quite sure I haven't checked it out, but I don't think you can do podcast and in second life

746
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:29,480
And you don't want to kill off the podcast in industry just yet Adam so a little less of the second life stuff

747
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,120
All right, bit more of some great British music and you know where to head for for that

748
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,680
Code UK slash pod

749
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:42,760
Cheers Adam. Yeah, all right me that now that's a that's a guy who's excited about doing stuff

750
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,920
And he's been doing this burbs thing for a long time to check it out. I did look at the site man. This is great

751
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,800
And we definitely got to talk about how we can do things together for sure

752
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:55,480
I don't have an English band lined up although, you know, I'm I'm happy to play anything from anywhere

753
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,320
This was something

754
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,920
That is not pod safe

755
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:03,960
In that respect that it's not on the pod safe music network. I was given permission specifically to play it

756
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,680
I'm not gonna tell you who it is until after the songs. I want you to listen. I want

757
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,680
I want you to tell me

758
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,080
We listen to this piano who's playing the piano

759
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,440
It's also the same person who produced the record by the way

760
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,040
I'll tell you who the the band is as well

761
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,440
Have to listen to it. Let me be the one on the Charlie

762
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,440
We've all the girl I love before

763
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:45,800
Down the hard time baby, I'll be the first bit it

764
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:50,120
Oh, you're down. I'm gonna let that count when I'm low

765
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,160
No, no, they stop the wicked deal about it

766
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,280
I do my best on the answers to your questions

767
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:05,320
But I ain't gonna promise that the way it won't come again

768
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:11,320
And if all I'm dealing is baby, it wants you from your hands

769
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,000
Let me be the one who makes you again

770
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,320
Let me be the one who's always there for you

771
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:33,720
When you feel us but with an alcohol sound and you're only just

772
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:40,600
And if all your way, let me be the one who makes you stay

773
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,280
I want to be the one

774
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,880
Gotta be the one

775
00:49:55,320 --> 00:50:01,800
I don't want to be the one who's always there for you

776
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:07,000
When you feel us, let me be the one who makes you stay

777
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I don't want to be the one who makes you stay

778
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,200
I don't want to be the one who makes you stay

779
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,700
You know, don't break skies and get rid of it

780
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:23,700
Baby, I ain't here on my him and not here

781
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:30,200
Oh yeah, I'm all but I'm that hard to let them walk right here

782
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,200
I do my best on the access to your questions

783
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,200
But I ain't gonna promise that the way won't

784
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,200
Come again

785
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:45,200
Just let it wash away his sense

786
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:53,200
Let me be the one who makes you care

787
00:50:53,200 --> 00:51:01,200
Lord, let me be the one who's always there for you

788
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:06,200
When you feel alone, where's the love you're saying

789
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,200
I don't want to just take it away

790
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:15,200
Let me be the one who's always there for you

791
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:22,200
When you feel alone, where's the love you're saying

792
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,200
I don't want to just take it away

793
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:30,200
Let me be the one who's always there for you

794
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:36,200
When you feel alone, where's the love you're saying

795
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:41,200
I don't want to just take it away

796
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:46,200
I don't want to just take it away

797
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:56,200
Let me be the one who's always there for you

798
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:01,200
I don't want to just take it away

799
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:06,200
Let me be the one who's always there for you

800
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:11,920
But I ain't gonna promise that the way I'm over here

801
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,880
But I'll try how it is

802
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,640
You'll make up and let me make it

803
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,640
You'll make it everybody

804
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:28,040
You'll make up and let your words do me make it

805
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:33,040
You'll make it, you'll make it

806
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,120
You'll make it everybody

807
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:40,760
You'll make it everybody

808
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,000
Tattoo, rodeo

809
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Let me be the one by permission

810
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,040
The track was sent to me by

811
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,080
Okay, did you figure it out yet? Who it is?

812
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:55,080
We were in London yesterday and I've known Ron for 12 years

813
00:52:55,080 --> 00:53:00,040
And still don't know everything luckily about him and vice versa, I hope

814
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:05,320
And we were talking and he reminded me that he had written some, I think he wrote some of the songs

815
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:11,480
But he definitely produced Tattoo, rodeo's album, which is great because I used to have a Tattoo, rodeo leather jacket when they were out promoting

816
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,480
I think it was Atlantic Records

817
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:18,360
And I believe I interviewed them in Los Angeles even at the same James Club or something weird like that

818
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,600
And Ron at the time apparently was living in LA

819
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:25,360
He had to produce this record and played piano and some of the guitar parts

820
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,360
And he actually sold the entire master to Atlantic Records

821
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,320
And I just thought it'd be cool for you to hear some of the work he's done

822
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:35,160
Although it's impossible that he can give me full permission to play that

823
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:40,040
He said he would he would stand up in court if any problems, any problems occurred

824
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,520
So a cool idea that let me be the one Tattoo rodeo

825
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,400
Okay, so we're over our 40 minute mark but I'm gonna keep it under an hour

826
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,160
We're gonna say goodbye to you now first of four

827
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,920
And I now have a new version

828
00:53:53,080 --> 00:54:02,480
Beta 067 so it should be even better in its communication with with the PDN more about that on the dev cast today

829
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,760
As I said, we post a new one devcast.pot show dot com portions of the show brought to you by go daddy

830

That's it animal curry dot com

836
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:32,120
One more time the phone number like you couldn't have paused it and written it down, but

837
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:44,040
It's fun to say it 201 65 6567 or in the UK 0207 681 3753. I like the US number a lot better than the UK number

838
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:48,200
