Delta Sierra Charlie 359er.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,320
This podcast is explicit in nature as we start with the word from Brother Mark from Pod Show

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,320
LA.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,760
You big looking like a friend spin-off sucking lame ass reality show cloning, Sarah

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,400
Jessica Parker looking like sea biscuit non-romantic comedy filming, stupid plot, stupid

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,200
story, stupid casting, waste of money, basic instinct too.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,240
You got to be freaking kidding me producing, big dumb waste of two hours of my life.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,760
Where the hell are your freaking balls?

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,800
Where the hell is the next pulp fiction?

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,840
Clark's Taxi Driver or Seinfeld, or even anything worth the voting.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,400
One freaking Iota of my time, too.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,400
Worthless junk you're crapping out because you're so out of touch.

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,280
You can't see that Tom Cruise has jumped the shark of life.

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,280
You my epic cantor's leeches.

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,280
With no integrity, always every stupid suit with an MBA and no creative experience has

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,680
got to spray on the hydrant with their worthless infantile and insulting ass-enine ideas that

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
just don't work.

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,640
And don't screw everything up because the only chances you ever take are ordering the

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,640
chef salad and not the Caesar at Spagos.

23
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,240
Hey, power launch on this, you self-important tinsel town pod knockers, you're out of

24
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,280
date, you're out of touch, you're out of ideas, guts, and vision, and I'm out of

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,320
any ability to give a flying fuck in a rolling donut about what you do anymore.

26
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,920
So kiss my ass Hollywood, I got something better, I got Pod Show LA.

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,120
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next generation radio

28
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,360
content in my ears.

29
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

30
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:22,000
I lost my young, my house and my wife misplaced my edge, my keys and my life, I can't

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:35,000
begin to begin again, I have to find out, just wherever I've been, but I'm happy.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:45,160
Singing the blues, got the clothes on my back, ain't got nothing to lose, still got my friends.

33
00:02:45,160 --> 00:03:05,480
We're sharing some booze, guess I'll let it be, and sing, yeah, the blues, yeah, the blues, yeah,

34
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:16,400
ain't got no guard, no hope on no gas, just one wedding ring, and I kick in my house, I'll

35
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:29,440
fall, no I don't need anything, just some good friends, and this bottle of dreams, and I'm happy,

36
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:39,600
singing the blues, got the clothes on my back, ain't got nothing to lose, still got my friends.

37
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:54,880
We're sharing some booze, guess I'll let it be, and sing, yeah, the blues, yeah, the blues,

38
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:10,960
yeah, the blues, yeah, the blues, yeah, the blues, yeah, the blues, yeah, the blues, yeah, the blues, yeah,

39
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:27,040
ain't got nothing to lose, still got my friends, yeah, the blues, yeah, the blues, yeah,

40
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:42,040
ain't got no guard, no hope on no gas, just one wedding ring, and I kick in my house,

41
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:54,120
I'll fall, no I don't need anything, just some good friends, sharing some booze, guess I'll let it be, and sing, yeah,

42
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:10,200
sing, yeah, the blues, got the clothes on my back, ain't got nothing to lose, still got my friends,

43
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:32,120
sing, yeah, the blues, yeah, the blues, yeah, the blues, yeah,

44
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:56,280
yeah, the blues, yeah, the blues, yeah,

45
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:27,800
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the blues, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh man,

46
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,680
I just keep hearing more from these guys, I can't stop playing and coming ground from Texas,

47
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,640
straight from the pod safe using network and music.vaachow.com. That's three bottles of

48
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,400
Bottles of dreams. Bottles of dreams. Bottles of dreams. Bottles of dreams. Bottles of dreams.

49
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,160
Bottles of dreams. That's it. Common ground. I've played a couple other

50
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,520
of their songs. I keep hearing these songs on different podcasts that I

51
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,960
listened to and I'm like, oh yeah, I got to listen to that and I look at the

52
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,800
show notes. It's just common ground. Yeah, I think I heard them. I added to my

53
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,520
playlist and then I'm like, I have already played like three or four of these

54
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,080
guys songs. Excellent stuff. Hey, everybody. I got a semi. Yeah, semi sunny

55
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:11,920
today. It's the sun has just come up over the bay. It's a little bit before

56
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,240
7 a.m. here in the Curry condo in Northern California. So it'll be kind of a

57
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,480
nice day. The end of yesterday was okay. I guess that I'm just expecting too

58
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,400
much from San Francisco weather. You know, it is still kind of a mix between Seattle

59
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,640
and Los Angeles with much more on the Seattle side. Last night I actually went

60
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,800
home. You know, you guys know, I really don't drink. Went out for a couple of

61
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,360
beers. This played a couple of places called Zeitgeist on Debose and Valencia

62
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,920
in the city and it was really, really cool. It was a beer bar, but you kind of

63
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,000
walk in and you go out the back and then it was all you could have been an

64
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,800
Arkansas for all I know. It was kind of like a, you know, the sun was just

65
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,000
kind of setting. It wasn't warm, but, you know, it was a nice atmosphere,

66
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,680
picnic tables, old jalapies and all kinds of junk out and back. And then this

67
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,400
incredible mixture of beer known as the Zeitgeist, which actually I video

68
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,600
recorded what is in it. So maybe I'll put that on one of my, my video podcast

69
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,320
in the near future. But it was great. You know, had a nice little bit of Indian

70
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,200
after that, some nice chat, nice conversation. And it just kind of completed

71
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,280
out my perfect San Francisco day yesterday. Yesterday, by the way, we started

72
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,160
with our advertising 2.0 campaign, one brand many voices. That's right. We have

73
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:42,760
about 50 podcasts on the network now. We have this humongous promotion with

74
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:49,040
GoDaddy. And it's, it's really cool because every single podcast is now

75
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,880
enabled to give their listeners a discount on several of the GoDaddy products.

76
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,840
Now, you also may have heard that the podcasts now start with an automatically

77
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,800
inserted promo tag, specifically for the GoDaddy promotion, which I'm very

78
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,280
excited about because now we have all these pieces of moving pieces of technology

79
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:13,000
working. And it's kind of interesting because I think what does it go as you

80
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,720
do? What is the slogan that we came up with? You want a badass domain name,

81
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,920
something that, in fact, it was the word badass. And I hadn't really thought

82
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,560
this one through because Steve Webb of life spring podcast, I immediately

83
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,320
hopped on on the internet and said, oh, wait a minute, this is not what I want in

84
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,880
front of my show, which of course is totally understandable. So the cool thing

85
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,440
about the, the de-gap system, which we have, our dynamically generated audio

86
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,120
placement, is that we can put something else in to automatically run in front

87
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,800
of Steve's show. So we're going to take care of that. And then, oh, man, just

88
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,880
wait until the podcasters have control over that and you can start to move

89
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,840
stuff around. And then, hopefully, we'll give listeners the opportunity to

90
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:59,360
mess around with the order of different pieces of the show. So, and of course, if

91
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,000
you, if you go to GoDaddy, we have three deals for you for source code

92
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,720
listeners, for straight up 10% discount, additional discount to any order you

93
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,560
already have. When you order at godaddy.com, use DSC one as your promo

94
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,880
code. If you use DS2, when you check out, you'll save an additional $5

95
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,320
off any order of $30 or more. And if you just want, you know, and this is

96
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,880
actually this is fun to do. I've done this many times. If you just want to get

97
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,480
a friend of yours, a cool domain name, it's only 695 for an entire year if you

98
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:37,520
use the code DS3. And that is actually fun. People have purchased domain names

99
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,480
for me as gifts all the time and they just map them to curry.com. It's kind of

100
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,800
funny. You know, and so on. Hey, look what I got you for your birthday

101
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:50,680
present. So, and of course, you don't have to use my codes. Use any of the

102
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,240
pod show podcast network codes because you actually directly contribute to

103
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,240
helping that podcaster because the more the more domains they are able to

104
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,960
to help sell the more money they make. So, it kind of works all around very

105
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,880
excited about it. Particularly about the technology piece though, it's kind of

106
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:17,320
cool to be able to be able to see the network kind of come together. More

107
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,120
about that tomorrow. I'm sure on the thank God. It's Friday edition, which will

108
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,920
be the last show in San Francisco for this trip after that. It's back home or

109
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,120
back to the other home. And see, what's the next Monday? I've got a, I'm on a

110
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,480
panel at the Guardian Media Conference. That should be pretty cool. I'm

111
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,840
thoroughly expecting Roger Smalls to show up somewhere, which would be our first

112
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,920
meeting. And then, uh, end of the week, end of next week, wrong vacation. Oh,

113
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,960
cannot wait. Hi Adam, this is Steven Schleicher. And this is Charlie, not the

114
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,360
penis, reocconced, Richard British, Kirkfield, Oregon, the Tona, Charlie White.

115
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,840
From the coolest roundup podcast, we are super excited to be one of the newest

116
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,920
members of the pod show family. We listen to a lot of quality podcast each day

117
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,200
and we really want to thank you and pod show for inviting us to join.

118
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,360
Coolness roundup is a weekly podcast aimed at answering questions about that

119
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,240
complicated world of consumer technology.

120
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,960
Branch, you need some help keeping your computer healthy or you're looking for a new

121
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,160
camera for your next vacation. Maybe you're looking to buy a new television and

122
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,520
you don't know whether you should get an LCD or a plasma screen. Each week,

123
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,760
Steven and I talk about the best and worst gadgets and devices we've seen during the

124
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,600
week. We answer listener email, dive deep into a topic of the week, and often have

125
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,440
spirited discussions on technologies that are changing our world. And Adam, we

126
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,440
want everyone to know that we also give away free prizes every week and some of them

127
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,520
are worth a lot of money. The coolest roundup, the tech show for everyone, are in a circle.

128
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,400
Are in a circle. Coolness roundup, welcome to the network guys. Congratulations. Great to

129
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:53,480
help you on board. Thanks for the promo. I was going to say something. Oh yeah,

130
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,480
about you mentioned prizes on the coolest roundup. We have something really cool that we're

131
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,680
going to do. I'm hoping sometime mid next week. I'm calling it the golden ticket.

132
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,880
Matt, this is going to be so much fun. We now have the technology. I'm really, I'm really

133
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:17,560
psyched about this. We now have the technology to, let's say, you know, of the, the hundreds of

134
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:23,960
thousands of downloads that the daily source code receives. We can actually now take one

135
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:31,800
downloaded random. So, you know, let's imagine the 6,000th or the 60,000th person to download

136
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:38,760
the Charlie on any particular day would actually receive a different show. And it would be different

137
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:44,040
because the show would say congratulations. You've just won the golden ticket. And it would be the

138
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:50,280
only winner chosen at random. And of course, you know, it's kind of like a, uh, in a way it's a bit

139
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,440
like a lottery because if you don't listen, then you can't claim your prize. So you have to listen.

140
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,960
And, uh, and there's only going to be, whether it could be multiple, we're just going to start off

141
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,120
with one. So I want to start testing this. It's a part of the gap that I just talked about. We'll

142
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:08,920
test that that next week. I already talked to Sam Levin at Pod Show HQ. Let me just see,

143
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,240
he sent me an email about we had a prize to do this one on a second. Let me see. I'm just

144
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,760
popping the Gmail real quick here. Gmail has been kind of funky the past few days. I get a lot of the

145
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,720
put you head between your knees, pray, and try again in a few minutes. Don't like that very much.

146
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:30,520
Makes me a little bit nervous. You know, scenes have got four full gigs of my stuff on their servers.

147
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:38,760
Let me see where Sam, here we go. A key span audio video dock for the iPod, excuse me,

148
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:45,080
plus the, since how audio video RF remote. Oh, cool. Yeah, that's like a some super power remote.

149
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:50,920
So you can, so you have a dock and then you have a power remote that you can use in any other room.

150
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:56,200
Cool. Okay, Sam. So we'll be giving both of those away. Details on it next week. I just wanted

151
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,680
to let you know that that's coming because it's just, you know, the network is starting to happen. I'm

152
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,640
loving it. Also, the email situation we're now getting through to hotmail. We're not getting through

153
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,400
to all service providers, but we're getting through the hotmail now. So something starting.

154
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,760
Someone's doing something somewhere. Hey, Adam, regarding Wednesday showed DSE. You

155
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:20,040
did it to me again. I'm driving right now. And I'm listening to some feedback about the,

156
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,720
the pod safe music network. And I just got to tell you. Okay. Now, I'm, I don't have a podcast right

157
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:32,120
now. Okay. I, but I am something very important out there. I'm a listener. And I appreciate this new

158
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:38,040
medium. More than probably your average person out there. But this is my point. You already got

159
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:44,520
streaming music out there. Okay. Pod safe obviously means a whole lot more than streaming.

160
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:51,480
Music. And this is my point. And I do have one. I don't buy much it from iTunes because I really

161
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,280
don't care about a most of the music that's there. If I want some music, I'll just go to

162
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,480
Rhapsody and I'll stream it and I'll play it and play it again. And the way Wi-Fi is working,

163
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,360
you know, you can always get the stuff out there. It's always going to be available. Okay. And you

164
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,000
can record it if you want. Damn it. There's so many different ways to get in the music. But what's

165
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,360
cool is as a listener who appreciates this medium, podcasting and pod safe music and all the stuff

166
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:25,160
that comes with it. It's the artist, baby. I'm appreciating the artist. And I want to give the

167
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:31,800
artist money. Let me give you money. Just like a lot of other people out there that are waiting

168
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:37,880
to hear the challenge. I have mentioned this before, but it's going to work because if I know that

169
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:45,080
my nine, nine cents can help somebody out there. Okay. Somebody out there. It's going to mean

170
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:54,680
that it's something that I appreciate doing. And I want to do. So, all right. I'm a listener.

171
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,720
I love your show. Adam, keep it up. But you make me go crazy sometimes. I stop pull around,

172
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:07,640
get the damn microphone and all the best you do for peace. Yeah, baby. Thank you so much. I love

173
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,120
it when listeners send an audio comments. God, that's so nice. And identify yourself as a listener,

174
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:18,120
please. That's nice, you know. Because we love doing this stuff for you. And definitely,

175
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,000
you know what Ron and I were talking to a couple of analysts the other day. We get calls all the

176
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,720
time from like the gardener group or forest or the Pew study or whatever. And they want to pick

177
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:35,800
our brain about what's going on. And the state of the industry, all that stuff. And it's amazing,

178
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,480
how little, well, it's not even that they don't do the research, but they're so skewed towards

179
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:49,480
existing models of music and entertainment and the recommendation and it's all based upon technologies.

180
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,920
And you know, we take a lot of effort. We make, we put in a lot of effort to explain that this

181
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:01,160
is something different. And this comment from a listener, not a podcast from a listener, is exactly

182
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:07,080
right. People are not, it's not just about buying a song, okay. It's about the involvement that you

183
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,640
have with these artists. Yeah, okay. So the universe may be a little bit smaller. And by the way,

184
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:19,240
artists are very, getting very good at how to communicate with their fan base and with people who

185
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,800
are their customers. I would, I would basically have to say whether they look at them as, there's,

186
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:29,720
there's their wares as art or commerce or whatever. You know, they have a fan base. And it's about

187
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,000
that involvement. That is what's taking place in pod safe music. You buy a song. At this point,

188
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,960
you're 99% likely to receive a thank you note from the artist. If you buy a CD, you may get a

189
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,200
t-shirt thrown in or something like that. You know, this is, this is what's happening. And I have to

190
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,640
believe that that is a very important part of what's going on. I see it with Christina as well.

191
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,520
You know, she loves the fact that there's all these independent bands that she can, she can email

192
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,480
with and, you know, comment on their site and they're active in their forum or, you know,

193
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,040
whatever other type of platform they use to communicate with their fans. And oftentimes,

194
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:09,160
you know, I have also seen the incredible disappointment when they get picked up by label,

195
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,080
which more and more artists are seeing is not really that beneficial. And a lot of them do come

196
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,440
back after the fact, but they get picked up by label than you never hear from them again,

197
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,760
which is disappointing. But I'm pretty sure this going to be plenty of artists who will never

198
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,280
sign up to a mainstream label, because, you know, the profit margins on selling

199
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:37,000
15,000 units in the pod safe arena is probably going to be more for the artist than selling,

200
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,640
you know, 150,000 through a mainstream record company. It's just that simple. It's math,

201
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,880
ladies and gentlemen. But for people who enjoy music like myself, you know, I used to buy albums

202
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,960
and I'd spend hours looking at the pictures on the liner notes, particularly if it was a double

203
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,680
album member of those when it just opened up in the middle and then nice smell of vinyl and

204
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,720
cardboard and maybe to had a poster slipped inside the sleeve. You know, this is the new version of that.

205
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,720
It's real direct contact with the artist. It's just exciting. And I really appreciate

206
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:13,160
listener comments like that. Thank you. Hey, Adam. Peter Klythero and Suffolk in the UK.

207
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:19,640
This business about taking names in vain happens all the time to me. Every time anybody sees a

208
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,320
great bit of technology. Here's a great bit of music. They invert my show's name.

209
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:31,880
What's that you say? The name of the show. It's Suffolk and Cool. Suffolk and Cool.

210
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:39,160
Ah, just search under Suffolk on iTunes and credit where it's due. This is Lane Duck and chaos

211
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
from the Ponceau music network.

212
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,720
Excellent. Good name, man. Suffolk and Cool. Love it.

213
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:16,760
And we have a celebrity metrosexual moment today. Special guests checking in via audio

214
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:23,000
comment. Don and Drew. Speaking of bullshit, we're listening to Adam Kray's daily source code.

215
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,600
Your teeth all talking about him put snare on his junks and I told him he had a visual.

216
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,640
Because as you've seen him, I have seen his penis.

217
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,720
Yeah, but he's not talking about nearing his penis at all. He was talking about nearing his

218
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,160
another region. So what do you think he's talking about, Craig? Well, there's the balls.

219
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,560
Those get a little hair here, but I don't think you're going to put nearing your balls.

220
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,960
We're also going to put another region. Right over here, like above.

221
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,720
I think he's talking about the whole deal, not just like the bikini area. Well, you know what?

222
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,040
Clip this out right here. It's like this to him. This is a metrosexual moment.

223
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:09,160
Do you add a boyfriend? Were you talking about your balls with the snare?

224
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:16,440
I'm just curious. Maybe it was his uh, maybe it was the butt. He talked about uh, he must be

225
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,200
trombone. Maybe Patricia doesn't like the hair. Oh, maybe you're right.

226
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:30,600
To your Adam Curry. Was it the butt? Was it the ball? See, I was thinking he was talking about

227
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:37,160
like above the bikini. That's not very nether than is it? That's pretty nether. Yeah.

228
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,160
That's what I was thinking. What were you envisioning? I imagine just the whole thing.

229
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,760
Smooth. The whole thing. The whole thing. From friends to backs. That's the backs.

230
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,800
Might as well lather up down there. It's like chemicals. You don't want to really

231
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,680
lather. You had a specific time for him. No more than eight minutes? That's what it says in the

232
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:02,440
model. No, it says no more than 10. Hair removal scientists. How do you know?

233
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,200
Cause I accidentally put the feet on me once. And I said, oh, I know.

234
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:18,120
She works good. Okay, so yeah, that was my question. Yeah, for Adam. Okay, well, I'll submit that to his

235
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,160
Metro sexual moment for you. Thank you. Excellent. All right, well glad you guys did that because

236
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,920
maybe it's because you guys are been in Wisconsin too long, you know, but we all get all

237
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:35,320
geekly and funky when we talk about that stuff. I think that kind of pertains to Americans in

238
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,800
particular Europeans don't seem to be so hung up on it. Then again, you know, you go to a beach in

239
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:45,400
Europe. The women are topless just like the man and it doesn't seem to be a big deal, but yeah,

240
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,080
that's for a different source code another time. Look, your appearance is not for yourself.

241
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:56,040
You make your hair look pretty, or you put makeup on, or you do other things for other people.

242
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:01,560
That's to make them feel good about you, at least that's my theory. Now, the only other person who's

243
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:09,800
going to see my nether regions done, besides you, of course, is my wife. Now, you know, I'm a big fan

244
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:16,040
of porn, right? And a good porn, you know, stuff with a story, of course. And I watch it whenever

245
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,920
I can, whenever I have the opportunity. And let me tell you, you know, take a look at the guys there.

246
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,720
Do you see any hair? No, of course you don't. And believe me, you've just forgotten.

247
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,400
Or take a good look at Drew's crotch right now. I mean, I compare to any porn movie you've

248
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:38,040
seen done, please. Front to back, baby, all the way. Hey, folks listening to this show on

249
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:43,480
that serious stars 102, I'm about, oh, shit man, and Pdub sent me the whole rundown. I, uh,

250
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:49,880
uh, I'll see you tomorrow for Friday. God damn it. He's going to be so pissed at me. Shit. Oh,

251
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:55,720
I only want, I even put it in my line up. Oh, I wish I could turn, but if I could turn back,

252
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,360
time. So I'll tell you what, what I was supposed to say is specific to tell

253
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,920
why next, then match Weinstein for a full-hour dawn and Drew, the Gilmore Daily podcast,

254
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,320
followed by PW offense, digital flat sums. He's got a new one out. Uh, was that the beer show that

255
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,320
I heard the, the, the second beer show? Oh, no, the beer shoot. That's what I was. It was kind of cool.

256
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,760
And then the rock and roll geek show to wind it up. Crap. I need a producer.

257
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,720
Someone who's here early in the morning who can help me with my nair and stuff.

258
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:37,400
Hey, newbies. This is happy from bedtime stories. My kids love with another frequently asked

259
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:44,840
questions from the Charlie. Today we talk about Trinity. Trinity is Adam's Mercedes Ben station wagon

260
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:51,000
that runs on biodiesel fuel, but Trinity did not start as a Mercedes Benz, but rather as an idea

261
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,760
for a promo with Volkswagen during Adam's ongoing conversation about biodiesel fuels. Volkswagen has

262
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,680
been very interested in advertising on podcast. And I kept, I had to test that, you know,

263
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:09,160
we're on a way to Apple with Chris and I'm saying Chris, dude, get me a Volkswagen and we'll do a

264
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:16,440
couple things with it, you know, we'll broadcast from it, but also we'll do my biodiesel experiments on it.

265
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,720
That was the part that he had kind of a reason. I don't know how I'm going to pitch that.

266
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:28,840
But alas, no Volkswagen. Then on daily source code 297, Adam takes us on a sound scene tour and

267
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:37,000
introduces us to Trinity. I told you about this car that I saw parked right near our brand new office

268
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,120
and that I put a note underneath the windshield wipers saying, will you sell me this car? And today

269
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:49,640
I got a call this morning from Isabel and she said, Adam, I said, yeah, she said, well,

270
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,280
you left this note on my car. I just want you to know that I've actually had it up on Craigslist

271
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:01,960
for a couple of weeks. And yeah, it's for sale. And ladies and gentlemen, I present you with Trinity.

272
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:09,160
And Trinity was so popular. It didn't take long till Trinity had its own thing song,

273
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:15,720
which appeared on Danny's source code 300. All right, everybody,

274
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,160
feel free to sing along. You're going to be here in this tune. I love the future.

275
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:46,280
I can give you likely 1.25 times, feel like it's me out. Trinity, Trinity,

276
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:51,880
quintessential luxury home. Trinity, Trinity,

277
00:27:51,880 --> 00:28:00,280
have a buy-home, diesel, industry. But she could talk, you hear her thank, Adam for pooping in her

278
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:12,120
tango, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, Trinity, it's so good,

279
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:19,160
everybody. So that's almost perfect. Jeffrey Smith, thank you very much. I love the Trinity theme song.

280
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:25,560
That, of course, will for the foreseeable future mark a small discussion about biodiesel,

281
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:32,760
now Trinity and the biodiesel conversation on ongoing part of the daily source code. As Trinity,

282
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:40,680
now has a slogan, 3 My Machine. Well, newbies, now you know just about everything about Trinity.

283
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,640
This is happy from bedtime stories, my kids love and I'll see you next time at daily source code

284
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:57,640
frequently asked questions. Oh, happy. I love it. You know when I get my new show

285
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:03,480
side up on the the pod show podcast delivery network, which I already kind of have half built

286
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,360
behind the password protected area and all that stuff. I'm going to make a special little module

287
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:15,800
that has all these Charlie facts. Charlie facts. There you go. Now this is cool. I love it.

288
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,240
Because that is great. You know, people come in. So what the hell is this show about? Very often,

289
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,480
people saying, you know, I listened like 10 back episodes to understand what was going on.

290
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:31,000
This really is quite helpful and I appreciate it. You know, Earthling is still a sponsor of

291
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,080
the pod show podcast network. And yesterday, it knows it wasn't yesterday. It was early in the

292
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:43,960
week. See what this Monday or Tuesday on Steve Gilmore's Gilmore daily. And Earthling also sponsors

293
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,880
his show. He read a letter a piece of feedback about the about the advertising. And I just wanted

294
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:55,720
to share that with you. Let me see if I got it hooked up here. I think I do. They have shown that

295
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:02,520
they can be respected. Okay. You can love this. This is a listener feedback sent to Steve Gilmore

296
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:08,280
about the Earthling advertising in the same way that they are respecting us. And I'd like to

297
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:13,960
read you some email. I got it. Actually, it was a blog post from the blog post. Somebody who

298
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:25,960
Robert Lanko's perhaps, I'm not sure, but the site is planet SA best A.B. No to Steve Gilmore, I do believe.

299
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:31,160
Today, I went to Earthling.net and looked at their services. Of course, I have few uses for their

300
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:37,320
service since I live in Europe, but in case I moved to the US tomorrow, I need to be able to

301
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,760
make an informed choice. And he has a little smiley there. I learned all about everything through

302
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,880
the commercial and Steve Gilmore's podcast on the Pachon network. For example, the Gilmore gang.

303
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:54,440
And the first 10 listens, I thought, what a bad ad for a podcast. Then I started getting interested

304
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,960
in the different accents of the speakers. I studied North American literature and language. He says,

305
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:06,040
and finally, at about the 50th time I heard the ad, I thought, oh well, I'll give them the

306
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:12,840
respect they deserve and pay their sight of is it. There you have it, advertising even with

307
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:20,680
lame spots works. Often the frequency is key. Tung out of cheek, though. It is a great decision on

308
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:25,720
their part to put themselves out here in the blogosphere with all the coverage on better bad news

309
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:31,720
and other pages ripping them apart. Apparently, they care and I am willing to give them the benefit of

310
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:37,720
the doubt. Do you believe anything that's possible? I just thought that was, and yeah,

311
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,640
I said to these guys, boys, not you heard of it. We believe in an internet that's safe from virus.

312
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:46,280
This is a virus. Where's he from? Voiruses? Is he released? He's always not from my earloom.

313
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:53,560
So, that was another take on it, which I thought was pretty interesting. And this is, you know,

314
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:58,440
what you're hearing right now, this is what we're doubting advertising 2.0. Fuck web 2.0. Let's go

315
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:04,840
to advertising 2.0. That's a little more exciting to be. And you'll see that EarthLink, well,

316
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,280
we've talked about this. You know that the something's coming very, very soon, that's going to be

317
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:15,960
extremely, extremely fun for all. Speaking of fun for all, ladies and gentlemen, comic strip,

318
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:26,360
comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip,

319
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:32,040
comic strip, he is back. I think we've got everything kind of cooled off now with the

320
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:37,240
comic strip blogger. The board has calmed down a little bit and he started to make some sense again,

321
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,840
and he sent me another audio comment. Hey, I'm Kerry. See you, satellite radio is like a marriage.

322
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:49,000
You came for sex, but you stay for love. See you's just achieved 4 million subscribers

323
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,680
because they came for her outstanding, but people stay for other reasons. For matters too,

324
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:01,320
at living, for roadok, or for Baba the Lost Ponds. Let me tell you something. My favorite

325
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:07,400
on series is Jay Thomas Show. This is on the same channel as Pot Show, by the way. Adam Kerry,

326
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:14,600
I have kind request. Please contact outcs who is booking guests for Jay Thomas Show and get

327
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:20,040
interviewed by phone on Jay Thomas Show to it for me. Thank you. You know what, why don't we get you

328
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:26,920
interviewed by by phone on the Jay Thomas Show? That would be cool, blogger. And I'll talk to the

329
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:34,040
satellite guy. That's so unfair. I'll talk to PW. Oh man, he's hate me right now. PW is

330
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,480
uh, yeah, I PW has all the incident. I'll be cool. We'll get in touch with the guy, but I think you should

331
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,720
be interviewed, man. You're the one that is, you're the fan. You're, you know, promote our stuff,

332
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,840
will you? That would be really helpful. Would appreciate it. Love the comment as always. Now this

333
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:54,200
next and actually the final bit I'm going to play for you today is uh, it's a promo that typically

334
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,640
would be too long. I would, you know, I just think I'm not going to play that because it's just drawn

335
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,680
out, but it's uh, someone who's doing something that uh, that I really want to encourage and I think

336
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:09,960
is a very brave, uh, any from the UK. So there you go, buy a saw around. Hi Adam. This is Don McAllister

337
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,080
from the Screencasts Online and your oMac podcasts. I have some news that may be of interest to you

338
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,920
and the Charlie listeners, as I know a good proportion of them are podcasts as themselves.

339
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,840
We'll have to over 20 years in corporate IT. I've taken the life-changing decision to become a full-time

340
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:31,640
indie podcaster and do podcasting for a living. I have two podcasts, Screencasts Online, which is a free

341
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,520
video podcast delivering weekly Mac based tutorials for the desktop and iPod. I got to tell you,

342
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,600
I actually already heard about, uh, because I think you the on the most, I'm subscribed to your

343
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:46,920
Screencasts coincidentally, um, and I was just looking at you at the Screencast version of this audio

344
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:51,320
promo last night and then this, this, this, this showed up this morning. So it was, it's interesting

345
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,280
how the internet works in strange and mysterious ways. It's been running since August 2005 and

346
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,640
built up quite an audience. There are now over 40 tutorials to download, covering also to topics

347
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:07,160
from Mac OS 10 to application reviews to podcasting. And the show has quite a unique approach

348
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,440
in that it uses Screencasts to deliver the tutorials and I managed to keep my ugly mug off the screen.

349
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,600
The Euro Mac podcast is a weekly audio podcast covering Mac news, but with a European spin.

350
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,520
It's only just been launched in the past three weeks, so it's still building an audience,

351
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,960
although the feedback's been great.

352
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,320
All right, that's the one. I haven't got any sponsorship or advertising as

353
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,920
yet. It comes to people. But hopefully that will come now that I've time to promote the podcast

354
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:36,680
properly. However, what I have introduced to see me through the initial period is a new subscription

355
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:42,360
scheme called Screencast Online Extra. Now the main show remains completely free and you can just

356
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:48,280
subscribe via iTunes as normal. But the six month extra subscription includes a free DVD of all the past

357
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:53,320
shows in all sorts of formats, access to high definition and high resolution versions of the shows,

358
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,680
and you special show every month just for subscribers, a monthly newsletter and lots of other

359
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,480
good stuff. The full six month subscription actually works out less than a price of a decent

360
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,120
coffee from Starbucks each month. And it includes all the extras including the DVD.

361
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:14,440
If people want to drop over to the site at www.screencast online.com, then they can pick up this

362
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,600
week show which explains the background to why I've taken the decision and how I've gone about

363
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:23,080
setting it all up. There are also free downloads of the show in high definition and in hands

364
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:28,280
desktop format to try out. And as soon as the podcast show delivery network and the podcast

365
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,400
music network come out of beta, I'll be doing some free screencasts on how to use them and to demonstrate

366
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,040
their functionality. Ah man, that'll be so cool. Notice by the way, it's not beta. It's beta.

367
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:45,080
A new one for me to start using. Oh, we have the beta beta controversy. So I hope that the

368
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,600
Charlie listeners will support me in this new venture. If only to show that it's not just

369
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,600
Ricky Javece and the other mainstream podcastes that can make a living out of podcasting.

370
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,480
Thanks for playing this audio comment at them. It's really appreciated. Thanks again.

371
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,840
No dude, my pleasure totally. So three things hit me when I listened to that one.

372
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,560
Actually when I saw it last night as I was going to bed, I saw your screencast.

373
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:11,160
And so a couple things hit me first of all. Wow, what a great format for video.

374
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:18,120
It's not going to work that well on iPods because the screen is just too small. But actually I got a screen

375
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,880
recorder last night. While I was in bed, you know, you really inspired me.

376
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:28,920
And I was trying to record my desktop, which by the way, I deem is the most personal piece of real estate

377
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,040
I have the applications that are on there, the files, the folders. And I think that would be

378
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:39,640
interesting for other people to be able to look at that. And I was actually experimenting with

379
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:46,200
opening up a video window on the desktop. So what you would see as a viewer was my desktop with

380
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:53,560
my mug. It kind of often the corner. Now, you know, it's with an eyesight camera. So the quality is

381
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,600
minimum or minimal. Let's put it that way. And, you know, then I could actually take you through

382
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:04,280
stuff. And I could, I don't know. I just think that there's interesting stuff to do. The issue

383
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,720
I'm having, of course, is performance because the screen recorders get pretty bogged down when

384
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,800
you're, you know, pop in web pages and this video playing. And, of course, what I'd like to do

385
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,440
then is open up another quick time window and play some more video. So I have some experimentation

386
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:24,440
to do. And specifically, getting it out to MPH4. Man, this is, I do not know enough about this.

387
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:30,440
There's so many fucking options. Is it H.264 that I should be using? Is it the, the,

388
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:36,920
the, you know, a quick time, you can export directly to, to M4V, which they say is Apple's version

389
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:43,160
of, of MP4. Now, if you export to MP4, it plays like shit on the Mac, which I don't understand.

390
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,520
Or maybe it's just my Mac. I don't know. I just, I need something that'll work.

391
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:52,600
And I need to be able to record. And I think my Mac should be powerful enough. But it might not be.

392
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,760
I might not need some kind of dual. It would be a shame if I can't do it on the power book,

393
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,160
because it's so easy to do it anywhere. God, it would be so cool to show it. Just share you my,

394
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:06,200
my desktop world, my laptop. Oh, that would be fun. So that you really inspired me with that,

395
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:12,040
and I appreciate it. So I'm, I'm working on that. And then, uh, and of course, I really, uh,

396
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:17,000
was a shaft to hear that you, uh, are considering doing some screencasts of the pdn. That

397
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:22,600
will be great. In fact, um, maybe in a week or so, we should talk, and then, you know, we can get you

398
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:28,200
in early, as you know, it's going to be, uh, we're delayed by about 10 days. So somewhere around mid-April,

399
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:34,600
just around tax day, cleverly timed. We'll be, uh, we'll be unleashing everything. And maybe you can

400
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,000
have some screencasts in there before that time. Uh, and we should definitely talk business about that.

401
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,200
And, and also, as I was viewing your screencasts, I'm like, wow, what a great opportunity for

402
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,840
branding and advertising, writing the screencast. It, you know, for a whole bunch of reasons,

403
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,680
a whole bunch of types of advertisers that make so much sense. But you may not want to do that

404
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,760
in sounds like you're, you're down the pay route. And I think that in your case, that is probably

405
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,000
a very smart idea. And I love the, the packaging that you're putting together. So congratulations.

406
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I mean it. Congratulations. And, uh, I, I wish you lots of success. Okay, everybody, I'm going

407
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:14,040
to hit the shower, get dressed off to HQ another full day of fun stuff. Uh, oh, today I'm being

408
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,760
interviewed by the LA Times. That should be, I think it's today. That should be fun. Yes,

409
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,720
they run and I were interviewed by the, the chronicle. Um, and it just seems like the press is coming

410
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:29,480
through on another wave, you know, and, and of course, podpimp coordinates all that at HQ. Um,

411
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,640
so we're pretty stacked up this week. And, um, so maybe I'll get a video out tonight. I'll

412
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,800
mess around with some of that screencast technology. See if I can pull it together. Uh,

413
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,120
I'll check on, I got a lot to do. I'll check on the emails getting through to every single

414
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:49,960
ISP. So we can finally open up commerce on the pod safe music network. And, uh, last shoot, you know,

415
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:55,000
it'll just be busy. I'm ready to go home folks. I'm very, I miss my girls. I really do.

416
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,280
Uh, I'll see you tomorrow.

417
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,440
Bye, I can't last.

418
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,920
DailySourceco.com for the feeds. And add a Maccurry.com for the feedback.

419
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,600
Another pod show pod cast. Stick it in your ear.
