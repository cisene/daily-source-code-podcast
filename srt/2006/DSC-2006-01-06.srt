1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,800
Let's see, sound, yeah, spliff, yeah, senseo, yep, oh, we're good to go.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:16,680
Delta Sierra Charly 311, $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass, then the next

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,680
generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,680
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,680
I'm just taking this battle curry.

6
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,680
Hey, you're a dude, isn't it?

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,680
Yeah.

8
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,680
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do.

9
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,680
Oh!

10
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,680
20 years of winter tired, give up blow when you do it last.

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:15,680
The huge ballad, a huge ballad, a huge ballad, I do, you, you, you, you, you, while my mom dat I.

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,680
That's all

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,680
Time will die

14
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,680
Never take it

15
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,680
Time will die

16
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,680
I'll take it

17
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,680
I'll take it

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,680
I'll take it

19
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,680
Time will die

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,680
Time to die

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,680
I'll take it

22
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
I'll take it

23
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,680
I'll take it

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,680
I'll take it

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,680
I'll take it

26
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,680
Time will die

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,680
It's forever

28
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
In the world

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,680
They'll be fine, we'll be in a skylight

30
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,680
But it's fine, but it's fine, but it's fine

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,680
But it's fine, but it's fine, but it's fine

32
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,680
But it's fine, but it's fine

33
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,680
They'll be fine, but it's fine

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,680
They'll be fine, but it's fine

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,680
They'll be fine, but it's fine

36
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,680
They'll be fine, but it's fine

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,680
It'll be fine, but it's fine

38
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,680
They'll be fine, but it's fine

39
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,680
They'll be fine, but it's fine

40
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,680
But it's fine, but it's fine, but it's fine

41
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,680
They'll be fine, but it's fine

42
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
They'll be fine, but it's fine

43
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,680
They'll be fine, but it's fine

44
00:02:44,680 --> 00:03:14,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

45
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:44,680
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, real, got a fine and another thatア'll win the hit will the life. Tearалиu you tell a lot of things I hear. yeah, yeah, yes, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

46
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,680
oh

47
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,600
Goes without saying that you just can't go wrong in a Friday

48
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,640
with too much cowbell.

49
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,060
Golden Gods, found them thanks to Todd,

50
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,200
walked out, he sent me, I actually showed up this morning

51
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,760
in my email, he said, check out the Golden Gods

52
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,800
on the Podsate Music Network, totally dig it.

53
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,400
Just can't get too much cowbell.

54
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,920
I see that from the streets of London,

55
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,360
the cornfields of Iowa and the Gold Coast of California.

56
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,360
As they say, the Golden Gods make the kind of rock

57
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,160
and roll, you'd only find in your stone

58
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,280
or uncle's record collection.

59
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,880
Yep, somewhere I'm somebody's stone or uncle, I guess.

60
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,840
Back to doing the Delta Shara Charli Tag

61
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,920
at the beginning of the show.

62
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,760
Even if I vary to just a little bit,

63
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,280
you guys really seem to need that

64
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,400
for your mobile purposes.

65
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,960
So we'll just keep doing the tags at the beginning.

66
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,280
Hey, everybody, it's Friday.

67
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,600
Hi, yeah.

68
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,920
Last show of the week for me.

69
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,800
You know, I'm getting ready to head off to the Bay area.

70
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,080
And today we're going to do not just the Metro sexual moment,

71
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,600
but also we have got a Trinity segment.

72
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,280
And dude, the news came in yesterday

73
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,160
about John Stewart hosting the Oscars.

74
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,160
Wow, man.

75
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,360
That's going to be an awesome show.

76
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,600
I'm sure of it.

77
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,800
This guy is so good.

78
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,120
I finally found out where to where I can see the daily show

79
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,960
over here.

80
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,400
It's on, if you're in the UK,

81
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,160
he's on Sky Channel 165.

82
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,720
That's more for I think is the name of that channel.

83
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,960
They got some really good stuff on that.

84
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,720
So now I've pre-programmed everything.

85
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,800
Now I've got all the,

86
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,400
it's basically like a Tivo only.

87
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,600
It's made by Sky.

88
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,280
And you know, it doesn't have all the cool Tivo things.

89
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,400
As far as I know, I don't know if anyone hacking these

90
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,720
these skyboxes yet.

91
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,560
But now I also can record the tonight show

92
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,600
and late night with Conan, although, I don't think

93
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,240
I don't usually watch that.

94
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,960
Once in a while, I have an interesting guest on.

95
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,040
No letterman, unfortunately.

96
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,040
Boy, I certainly was able to see the letterman

97
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,040
or Riley bit didn't take long for that

98
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,360
to show up all over the net.

99
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,080
That's what I love about this stuff, man.

100
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,720
It's like, if something's, if someone's talking about it,

101
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,520
you'll get a hold of it.

102
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,320
You don't even have to go searching for anything.

103
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,400
It just kind of pops up.

104
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,080
Some friend will send that right along to you.

105
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,120
So congratulations to John Stewart.

106
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,480
That is phenomenal.

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,120
Man, and he is, he seems like,

108
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,720
I wish I could hook up with him again.

109
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,720
His people will definitely facilitate a meeting

110
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,920
if I have a proposal.

111
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,640
But I don't really have a proposal for him yet.

112
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,240
Nothing that'll make his people happy, I don't think.

113
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,480
Working on that.

114
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,080
But he was cool when he worked at MTV.

115
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,920
We worked at the first MTV B-Chowst together for a while.

116
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,920
Isn't this nice guy?

117
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,920
I genuinely think that he is the same guy

118
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,160
that you see on TV.

119
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,280
Okay, what else will we do today?

120
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,480
Some more pod save music now.

121
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,320
Oh, also a bug in my Macintosh,

122
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,760
one that I don't think has been documented very widely

123
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,120
and kind of stumbled on this bug by accident.

124
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,480
Let's do that right now, hold on a second.

125
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,760
I actually had some pro most stuff.

126
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,600
Well, you know what?

127
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,440
Now, I'll tell you what.

128
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,240
I got some really cool promos.

129
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,880
I think you'll like these three in a row.

130
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,880
I've been very selective today.

131
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,320
So listen those three promos.

132
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,240
Then we're gonna talk about this Mac audio program,

133
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,480
problem, this bug, which I'm not the only one

134
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,680
that has it and it's a really freaky one.

135
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,480
And quite honestly, it's pissing me off

136
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,120
as a podcaster who uses his Mac for sound.

137
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,080
What's up, everybody?

138
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,920
Hey guys.

139
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,760
This is Kyle.

140
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,600
And this is Jamie.

141
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,320
We do the naughty karate podcast.

On iTunes.

143
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,720
When you got a chance, check out our boy Squid.

144
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,040
Yeah, that's how that sounds like.

145
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,720
Yeah, that sounds like a comic book.

146
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,160
Yeah, that sounds like a comic book.

147
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,400
Six, six, three.

148
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,240
Did you hear it?

149
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,960
That was exactly what I was talking about.

150
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,840
And that's fathobo.com.

151
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,360
And after you check that out, check us out

Hi, yeah.

155
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,520
That was just around house, kicked to the face.

156
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,480
Hey Adam, it's J. Martinez from the TechX Podcast.

And I will be recording more.

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,280
And hopefully you'll stay subscribed.

167
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,400
And enjoy the rest.

168
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,760
Tonight, I'm just going to give you guys a preview

169
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,040
is called the title tonight's podcast,

170
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,600
which I'm going to be recording is called Abroca Password.

171
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,240
So if you'll tune in and enjoy what I have to say.

172
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,480
P to you later.

173
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,440
Oh, God, Christmas vacation.

174
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,280
Why have you done to me?

175
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,720
I've become a mini a chair out of curry.

176
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,960
I have botsers wedged at my butt.

177
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,760
I'm drinking, not some to say oh, but scar books.

178
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,040
And perfect.

179
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
Oh.

180
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,680
If this is happening to you and your podcasting daily,

181
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,960
you're a hardcore podcaster.

182
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,080
And you need to rock on man,

183
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,040
one of the revolution.

184
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,200
Yeah.

That's about R-O-X-P-B-O-C.

192
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,280
Yo, woo, elite.

193
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,320
I got to lift that one, T-S.

194
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,160
It's the revolution.

195
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,680
That's great.

196
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,280
He's 13, a budding podcaster,

197
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,280
doing just fine as far as I can tell.

198
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:07,960
So you heard it.

199
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
You heard the problem.

200
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,520
Some other people had heard this before.

201
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,080
In fact, Tim Pritlove said that he's kind of,

202
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,360
he admits he's sort of happy that I ran into the same audio

203
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,640
loop problems with my power book

204
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,320
in the last few minutes of Delta Sheriff Charlie 309.

205
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,760
This bug seems to be related to the new 15-inch power book

206
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,840
with optical audio interfaces only.

207
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,240
OK, I have the 15-inch power book.

208
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,960
I don't exactly know what the optical audio interfaces are.

209
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,800
Does that mean there's something new going on inside?

210
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Tim says he's suffering from the same problem.

211
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,120
And he knows at least three other people

212
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,080
with the same configuration with exactly the same problem.

213
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,840
He goes, and I think it would be helpful if you could bring

214
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,440
this one up in one of your next shows.

215
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,920
It's a really nasty bug affecting all podcasters.

216
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,360
And it more than one time ruined my recordings.

217
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,480
This is very, very freaky.

218
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,720
Now, I know that certainly some people

219
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,200
had Apple listened to this podcast.

220
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,320
So let's find out about it.

221
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,040
Is it something that can be fixed?

222
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,480
Is it a hardware problem?

223
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,920
Or is it a software problem?

224
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,760
It certainly seems to be very intermittent.

225
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,720
I actually rebooted my computer before doing the show,

226
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,520
just to make sure that I'd be kind of fresh with a clean boot up.

227
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,880
And amazing.

228
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,360
You don't hear it happen very often.

229
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,400
It usually happens when I'm using, you know what?

230
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,680
It could be a quick time thing.

231
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,680
Because I think that it only happens when I'm using iTunes,

232
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,200
when I'm using a quick time, I'm trying to think

233
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,360
if it's ever happened while I was watching like a Windows

234
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,520
media clip or something.

235
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,560
That could be, but certainly gosh, OK, well,

236
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,640
we have to start tracking this and start paying attention

237
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,720
to when exactly it happens.

238
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,760
Obviously, a culprit that comes to mind right off the top

239
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,920
of my head is a quick time.

240
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,880
But it certainly is not very good if you're using your machine

241
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,400
for podcasting.

242
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,720
Hey, what's going on Adam?

243
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,760
It's WooCash from Polish Detroit podcast

244
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,200
at Polish Detroit.com.

245
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,040
As you can say, from my strange, different accent.

246
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,200
I'm not native speaker, but I'm the host of one

247
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,680
and only Polish language podcast in the United States.

248
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,920
I just found out from Delta Sir Charlie Trio

249
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,640
and I that you have the same problem as I have.

250
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,520
I'm talking, of course, about this freaking audio loops

251
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,120
and new power books.

252
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,600
I'm just curious, maybe your listeners knows how to fix it.

253
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,440
It's really, really annoying.

254
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,120
You know, I have brand new shiny power book

255
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,760
and this loop just makes me crazy.

256
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,400
Yeah, yeah.

257
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,240
So I'm waiting, maybe somebody will help us.

258
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,120
Right on.

259
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,480
Polish side from Detroit, y'all.

260
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,960
I'm going to get on your ass, Apple.

261
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,080
So let's get working on this.

262
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,920
Let's figure it out.

263
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,680
You know, buggy's appear, buggy's do happen.

264
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,680
Let's see, we can fix it.

265
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,000
I hope it's not hardware related.

266
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,720
That's a real pain in the ass, for everybody involved.

267
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,160
Could just be a software thing, but it's definitely annoying

268
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,360
and it's definitely popping up at the wrong moment.

269
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,000
So far twice.

270
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,400
I think actually three times in a show.

271
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,880
I've never really restarted a show because of it.

272
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,360
Because, you know, I think it's kind of,

273
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,400
you know, oh, the, hey, look, if I had restarted a show

274
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,520
when it happened, then we never would have known about it

275
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,640
because I would have just thought it was an intermittent thing

276
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,040
that only I had, which I can totally

277
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,680
believe looking at all the stuff that I've got loaded on here.

278
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,480
So, all right, so we're going to pay attention to that.

279
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,880
See what becomes of it if you have any clues.

280
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,840
If you're a Mac, Mac head, send it on in.

281
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,160
Let's find out about it.

282
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,200
And since we still have more than 10 minutes to go on the satellite window,

283
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,240
I'd let everyone enjoy the Trinity moment.

284
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:50,680
Okay, for those of you who are new to the show, this segment is called Trinity.

285
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,640
That is the name of my Mercedes station wagon 300 turbo diesel from 1984,

286
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,520
which runs entirely on bio diesel.

287
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,720
I have learned quite an amount from the discovery show, dirty jobs,

288
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,720
and I'm really clued into how all this stuff I think should work.

289
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,240
So, let's see, things to point out in today's Trinity segment.

290
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,240
There's a, oh, this is kind of cool.

291
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,680
There's a car driving to China on biodiesel.

292
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,120
And you can check that out at ownisexperience.nl

293
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:34,120
I guess they're going from the Netherlands to China, entirely on the biodiesel.

294
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,120
That's cool.

295
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,120
Melanie Hartner says, Adam in response to your question,

296
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,120
hemp and cannabis are of the same plant family,

297
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,120
but hemp does not contain the same active ingredients.

298
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,120
The one we love so much.

299
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
And can be purchased here in Canada in any health food store.

300
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,120
I have someone my fridge in fact, she says it tastes great on salad.

301
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,120
It's quite expensive though, about 10 Canadian dollars for a leader,

302
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,120
but it's for human consumption, so maybe there's a less expensive version you can get for your car.

303
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,120
It says Melanie.

304
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,120
I mean, that would be the ultimate dream, right?

305
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,120
To be able to make biodiesel from hemp.

306
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,120
You know, that stuff grows like weas, right?

307
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,120
Okay, let me see, I've rigged everything here,

308
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,120
so I can do the audio comments much easier.

309
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
Here we go.

310
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,120
Hey Adam, this is Lucien from Planet TV.

311
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
Hey Lucien.

312
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,120
I wanted to see if I could give you a little more insight into the biodiesel bio fuel discussion

313
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,120
you're having about your new American ride, Trinity.

314
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,120
The first thing you need to know about bio fuels

315
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,120
is that when internal combustion engines were being developed,

316
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,120
two types of engines were designed.

317
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,120
Engines that ran off highly refined oils, gasoline type engines,

318
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,120
and engines that ran off of basically just purified oil,

319
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,120
or slightly refined oil.

320
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,120
And that was a diesel type engine.

321
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,120
An important thing to also note is that both of those engines

322
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,120
were originally developed to use either gasoline

323
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,120
or purified oils from both petroleum oil

324
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,120
and vegetable oil sources.

325
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,120
Now diesel type engines can run off either purified oil, vegetable oil,

326
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,120
or petroleum oil, or a slightly distilled version of that oil

327
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,120
called diesel.

328
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,120
Bio diesel is diesel fuel that is derived from vegetable oil sources

329
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,120
or animal fat sources.

330
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,120
Modern petroleum diesel engines could run on straight vegetable oil

331
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,120
but the engine wouldn't last very long.

332
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,120
They make it work and not ruin the engine

333
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
requires a conversion kit.

334
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,120
Not counting homemade kits,

335
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,120
the only professional conversion process available

336
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,120
for a modern petroleum diesel engine to convert

337
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,120
to straight vegetable oil replaces the injectors

338
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,120
as heaters to the tank and replaces other components necessary

339
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,120
to run the diesel engine on straight vegetable oil.

340
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,120
These professional conversions can also run on pure biodiesel

341
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,120
any bio diesel blend or on straight dirty or petroleum diesel.

342
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,120
A professional conversion of this type is the only conversion

343
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,120
that could be called a true bio fuel or bio diesel conversion.

344
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,120
And once completed these are true bio fuel cars

345
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,120
in as much as they can run on any fuel from purified vegetable oil

346
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,120
whether it's weight-special oil or pure pressed vegetable oil

347
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,120
or bio diesel or petro diesel or any combination of these.

348
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,120
Cars that have had these professional one tank conversions

349
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,120
have had hundreds of thousands of kilometers put on them in Europe

350
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,120
and in America.

351
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,120
And they afford their drivers a much broader variety of fuel sources

352
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,120
than a typical diesel engine.

353
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,120
This is possibly what you have in Trinity.

354
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,120
The Berkeley Depot will be able to tell you specifically

355
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,120
what type of engine and conversion you have

356
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,120
and also which type of fuels to use in it in order to make it last.

357
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,120
And finally, most engineers will tell you that even though

358
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,120
a professional bio diesel conversion will allow you to run any type of fuel

359
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,120
through the engine, most mechanical systems benefit from choosing

360
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,120
one type of fuel and sticking with it.

361
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,120
I hope this gives you some insight.

362
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,120
If you decide to try to make your own biodiesel,

363
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,120
there are several good systems that are available as kits.

364
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
Drop me an email I'll let you know.

365
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,120
Keep up the good fight.

366
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,120
And thanks again for watching my video podcast,

367
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
Planet TV.

368
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,120
You can still find it at dailyplanettv.net.

369
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
Thanks.

370
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
All right.

371
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,120
Thank you very much.

372
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,120
So yeah, please do send me any links you have to buy

373
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,120
a diesel manufacturing kits because that is what I finally decided upon.

374
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,120
We have to go through the process of adding,

375
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,120
I think it's what is it's glycerin and lie.

376
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,120
No, I'm sorry, methanol and lie.

377
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,120
A byproduct is glycerin.

378
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
There you go.

379
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
Methanol and lie.

380
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,120
And that then, you know, there's a process to base.

381
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
It's a refinery, a little refinery in your garage.

382
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
That's what I want.

383
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,120
I'm so into that.

384
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,120
I might even have a little bit of space at the condo

385
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,120
where I can sneak something like that.

386
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,120
And if no zs neighbors don't make too much problem.

387
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,120
I'd rather rent a garage somewhere.

388
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,120
We can set up a cool little factory.

389
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
You know, get our babe co running,

390
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,120
our Bay Area biodiesel corporate conglomerate.

391
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,120
And then finally,

392
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,120
Darryl Q-Lax has added,

393
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,120
and this is kind of what Lucien touched on.

394
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,120
Did you know that the first biodiesel was actually the first fuel

395
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
used in a diesel engine?

396
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,120
Yep.

397
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,120
The diesel used peanut oil in his original diesel engine,

398
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,120
including his demonstration at the 1900 World Fair.

399
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
He intended that his engine,

400
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,120
but used readily available biofuels.

401
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,120
The diesel engine was considered to be a strategic advantage

402
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,120
to the German war machine.

403
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
In fact, Mr. Diesel died mysteriously.

404
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,120
Shortly before Germany released a huge fleet of diesel submarines.

405
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,120
The fact that Mr. Diesel was friendly to the US,

406
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,120
great Britain,

407
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,120
and France is considered to be a factor in his death,

408
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,120
although nothing has ever been proven, of course.

409
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,120
It was only when the lubrication oil industry,

410
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,120
wow, direct spin around for a long time.

411
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,120
When they found that two of their useless byproducts,

412
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,120
gasoline and diesel could be used in these new engines,

413
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,120
and that these alternative fuels were even considered as fuel.

414
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,120
But soon after intense government lobbying,

415
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,120
gasoline and diesel fuels became the most common fuel

416
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,120
for engines around the world.

417
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,120
And these facts come from the book,

418
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,120
the clean power revolution by Troy Helming.

419
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,120
All right,

420
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:08,120
so we're up to speed with just a little more bio diesel industry information.

421
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,120
And almost 100% convinced now that the only thing

422
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
that is different on Trinity,

423
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,120
it does not have a straight vegetable oil heater and conversion kit,

424
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,120
but it does have new hoses because the regular rubber hoses

425
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,120
seem to dilute a little bit quicker using the bio diesel.

426
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,120
So that's it.

427
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,120
We've got to make one of these refineries in my garage.

428
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,120
She could talk.

429
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,120
You hear her fake.

430
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,120
I don't feel pooping.

431
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,120
You hear her fake.

432
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
You're Trinity.

433
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,120
Trinity.

434
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Yeah.

435
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,120
Right on, everybody.

436
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
Okay, let me see.

437
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,120
Still looking for a good word for video podcasting.

438
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,120
Ron Strupe says,

439
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,120
since podcasting uses an iPod,

440
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,120
this name podcasting.

441
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,120
If you use a video camera,

442
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,120
cam casting by a camcaster.

443
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,120
Yes, I'll take the credit for the term and share the history with you if you promoted.

444
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,120
Hurry before Steve Jobs takes the credit for it.

445
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,120
I don't know.

446
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
Cam casting.

447
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,120
Yeah, it's actually not too bad,

448
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,120
but I think that video podcasting.

449
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,120
We have to come up with some net a name for it all because,

450
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
you know,

451
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,120
what are you going to call it Photoshop casting?

452
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
You know,

453
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,120
it can all be casting.

454
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,120
I think somehow we've got to change that.

455
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
It's like having a mind space.

456
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,120
Wow, did you read that article?

457
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,120
It was huge on dig.com about the,

458
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,120
the corporate history of dig.com.

459
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,120
Very interesting where these guys came from apparently from xDrive.com.

460
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,120
And well,

461
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
there's a lot of,

462
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
I'd have to say,

463
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,120
almost accusations.

464
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,120
It has a very accusatory tone,

465
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,120
this article.

466
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,120
And I don't know if that's entirely warranted.

467
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,120
But it does talk a lot about what's happening with the data that my space users

468
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
are willingly providing.

469
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,120
Because, you know, you are basically,

470
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,120
you know, handing off all this information.

471
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,120
It goes back to one little piece in this article.

472
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
And I don't have the link handy,

473
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,120
but I got it off of dig.com.

474
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,120
So you can find it from there from the homepage.

475
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
What they're saying is that

476
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,120
there's a corporate culture that dates back to spam email lists

477
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,120
from the founders of my space.

478
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,120
The corporate culture is that people do not read the fine print.

479
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
So what is being insinuated?

480
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
And I do have a my space account somewhere,

481
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,120
but I haven't honestly haven't really used it.

482
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,120
What they're insinuating is something that could be very true

483
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,120
that basically all of the information you enter

484
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,120
and all of your data,

485
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,120
not just on aggregate,

486
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,120
but down to your individual,

487
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,120
your individual data is basically being used

488
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
to advertise to you.

489
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,120
And of course, that makes sense because that is entirely

490
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,120
the my space model is 99.9% advertising.

491
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,120
And so I guess the big question is,

492
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,120
does it really matter?

493
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,120
Well, of course it matters.

494
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,120
And it's your data.

495
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,120
I think it would be great if you could take all that information

496
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,120
and bring it over somewhere else and put it in some other system.

497
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,120
Maybe you'd want to have that data reside in Yahoo 360

498
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
or in Orcad or in Friendster.

499
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
And I think that this is the kind of stuff

500
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,120
that Steve Gilmore keeps hammering about.

501
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
I've listened to a couple of Gilmore Dailys

502
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,120
and Attention TechPodcasts.

503
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,120
It's really starting to dawn on me what this means.

504
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,120
For us users of this stuff,

505
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,120
you're not really thinking about it.

506
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
Because at the end of the day,

507
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,120
there are 35 million people who are using my space

508
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,120
who are just loving the experience,

509
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,120
having a great time.

510
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,120
Apparently they're clicking through on ads

511
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,120
that I guess are relevant to them.

512
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
And the whole thing is working.

513
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,120
The question is, do they know actually what they're doing

514
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,120
and what's happening with their data?

515
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,120
And I think that that's a pretty healthy conversation

516
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,120
to have because obviously if you're providing a service

517
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,120
to someone who's enjoying it,

518
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,120
you'll be even better if everyone knew

519
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,120
what's happening on both sides of the equation

520
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,120
and then you could probably even find tune that data.

521
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,120
You could get users of your product

522
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,120
to submit even more detailed information

523
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,120
about what they're really into

524
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,120
or what that particular online persona

525
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,120
of the day is interested in

526
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
that they're using.

527
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
And then Christina has a whole bunch of different accounts

528
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
for different stuff.

529
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,120
Hey, satellite folks, have a great weekend.

530
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
The Pacific Coast Hellway is coming up next

531
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,120
and I'll talk again on Monday right here

532
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,120
on serious stars 103.

533
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,120
And for those of you who are listening to the podcast,

534
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,120
this is where we really get down and dirty, right?

535
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,120
What's it going to...

536
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
Oh yeah.

537
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
Okay.

538
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,120
If you've never listened to Pacific Coast Hellway,

539
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,120
I suggest you subscribe to it.

540
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
It's a great show.

541
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,120
It's about 20, 25 minutes every single day.

542
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,120
So it's the perfect length for a podcast.

543
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,120
And Mark Yoshimoto and M.Koff went into...

544
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,120
I love it when he goes into these rants, man.

545
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,120
He went off into something so beautiful yesterday.

546
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
I want to play...

547
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,120
Actually, it's five minutes exactly.

548
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,120
So if you've already heard the show

549
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,120
if you are a subscriber or if you just don't

550
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,120
dig what he's saying, you can shuttle past it

551
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,120
and you'll find me on the other side of the next five minutes.

552
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,120
But it's brilliant, man.

553
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,120
So would someone please tell me?

554
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
What the fuck?

555
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,120
Mainstream media thinks it's doing with its feeble attempts

556
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,120
to get into podcasting.

557
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,120
I mean, do they really think

558
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,120
they can just slap any old program

559
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,120
into an MP3 file?

560
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,120
I can just see the execs talking about it now.

561
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,120
Gee, Bob, you know what sounds totally exciting in hip?

562
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,120
Hey, let's throw nightline into an MP3 file

563
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,120
and we'll be riding the bleeding edge.

564
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,120
You know what else rides the bleeding edge?

565
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,120
That's right.

566
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
A tampon.

567
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,120
And I'd much rather put that into my ear

568
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,120
than what Mainstream media is

569
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,120
shitting into the pipeline.

570
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,120
I mean, who are these guys kidding?

571
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,120
A national public radio is getting into podcasting

572
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,120
national public radio.

573
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
I mean, what?

574
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
Come on.

575
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,120
What can be more cool?

576
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,120
Then listening to a mind-numbing

577
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,120
all things considered peace

578
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,120
and resurrection of traditional dancing in Belarus

579
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,120
in the post-Soviet era on your iPod.

580
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,120
A piece of electronic hardware,

581
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,120
no one in Belarus could afford

582
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,120
even if they traded their children for it.

583
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,120
Speaking of which,

584
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
we had to intern guy in trade

585
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
for a use to us to drive

586
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,120
and I gotta say we feel kind of ripped off.

587
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,120
Now, do any of you even know

588
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,120
what NPR stands for?

589
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,120
That's right.

590
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120
No pulse required.

591
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,120
And then there's PBS.

592
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,120
I mean, who the fuck is listening

593
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,120
to Jim Lair's NewsHour podcast?

594
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,120
I can only assume that while

595
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,120
flipping through the channels,

596
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,120
people have accidentally stared deep enough

597
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,120
and the Lair's black soul is eyes

598
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
long enough to become hypnotized

599
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
into subscribing to this fun fest.

600
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,120
Hell, if you think watching

601
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,120
the NewsHour is boring,

602
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,120
think how boring it would be

603
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,120
with no exciting PBS graphics.

604
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,120
I mean, if PBS were so fucking entertaining,

605
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,120
they wouldn't have to send their young

606
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,120
female PAs out through my neighborhood

607
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,120
selling their bodies for donations

608
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,120
in the first place.

609
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Wait, make of it.

610
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,120
What?

611
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,120
She was from the Girl Scouts?

612
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,120
Oh, cookie?

613
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,120
Oh, I thought she said,

614
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,120
never, well, they're over 18, right?

615
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,120
Oh,

616
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,120
anyway,

617
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,120
you want really boring.

618
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,120
There are over 100 podcasts

619
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,120
on the iTunes directory

620
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,120
for weather.

621
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,120
Many of them from mainstream sources

622
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,120
like the Weather Channel

623
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
or your local television station.

624
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
I mean, is it just me?

625
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Or can't you just turn on a TV or radio

626
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,120
anywhere and get the weather forecast

627
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,120
in about two minutes?

628
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
I mean, first,

629
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,120
who thought this would be a good idea?

630
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,120
And second, who's putting this

631
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,120
onto their MP3 player?

632
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
What's next?

633
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120
Traffic updates?

634
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,120
I mean, listen,

635
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,120
we're not saying that every independent podcast

636
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
is great.

637
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,120
Lord knows there's a tremendous amount

638
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,120
of shite out there.

639
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,120
Ignition, I'm looking at you.

640
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,120
But you, as a consumer of entertainment

641
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,120
and information content,

642
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,120
should demand that if the corporate

643
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,120
powers that be are going to do something

644
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,120
that they call podcasts,

645
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,120
that they should at least give you

646
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,120
original content, taking other media

647
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,120
and ripping them into an MP3 file

648
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,120
doesn't make it a podcast.

649
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,120
It makes it a fucking repackage.

650
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,120
The only network doing anything

651
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,120
that requires a little bit of thought

652
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,120
isn't the major American ones.

653
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,120
No, it's the Brits.

654
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
Now let me say up front

655
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,120
that I don't really find the Ricky Jervais podcast

656
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,120
all that funny.

657
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,120
But at least you have to give the guardian

658
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,120
unlimited props for doing

659
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,120
an original podcast.

660
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
I mean, full of content,

661
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
you can't get anywhere else.

662
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
Now, what do we get from the American media

663
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,120
companies?

664
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
NBC nightly news?

665
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,120
Fuck, nobody's watching that on TV.

666
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,120
Why the hell would I want to watch

667
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,120
Peter Jennings on my little iPod screen?

668
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
What's that?

669
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,120
What?

670
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,120
He's dead?

671
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,120
Wait, wasn't that broker?

672
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,120
Jesus, who can tell?

673
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,120
Jennings broker, live dead,

674
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,120
not much difference to me.

675
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,120
Now, do you know what kind of fucking

676
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,120
con job box tried to pull off

677
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
as a podcast?

678
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,120
It's build as a Simpson's podcast,

679
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,120
but you know what it really is?

680
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,120
A guy just some dude talking

681
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,120
about the Simpsons.

682
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,120
It's like, well, last night Homer did this

683
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,120
and Bart did that tune

684
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,120
and next week when Homer does that

685
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,120
and Bart does this.

686
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,120
Did anyone listen to that

687
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,120
steaming pile of Matt

688
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,120
graining's post-Barito

689
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
bowel movement?

690
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,120
It's fucking pathetic.

691
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
They didn't even have

692
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
the wherewithal

693
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,120
to make a real commercial.

694
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,120
Why that crap cast

695
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,120
is still in the top 100

696
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,120
is a fucking mystery to me.

697
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
Actually, no.

698
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
It's not too much a mystery.

699
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,120
It's there

700
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,120
because it's got a Simpsons logo on it.

701
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
And they're lying to the public.

702
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
They do the same thing

703
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,120
for the family guy, please.

704
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,120
Oh, please.

705
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,120
American public run

706
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,120
from this shit on a stick

707
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,120
like you would run

708
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
from a guy

709
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,120
with shit on a stick.

710
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
Welcome back

711
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
if you've shuddled

712
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
through all of that.

713
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
Mark Yoshimone and Enco

714
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
from the Pacific

715
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
of Elco's players.

716
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Great job.

717
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
And that rant goes on

718
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,120
for at least another three

719
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,120
four minutes.

720
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
It's really, really good

721
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,120
and it's so incredibly true.

722
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,120
And you know,

723
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,120
look at iTunes.

724
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,120
You know, yes,

725
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,120
the directory

726
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,120
does have all kinds of podcast

727
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,120
available,

728
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,120
but look at what they're really

729
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
highlighting.

730
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,120
Okay.

731
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
Look at the ratio of

732
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
mainstream

733
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,120
to independent.

734
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,120
And I'd say two things about that.

735
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,120
One, first of all,

736
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
of course,

737
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
that's what Apple's going to do

738
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,120
because those are all the relationships

739
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,120
that Apple has.

740
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,120
They've been inside Hollywood.

741
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,120
That's how the whole iPod came about

742
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,120
is because of

743
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,120
basic concessions that they

744
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,120
that they made as a company.

745
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,120
And that's,

746
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,120
I'm pretty happy they made those decisions.

747
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,120
Now let's not rely on

748
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,120
the iTunes and the iPod

749
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,120
as are only source of distribution here.

750
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,120
Okay.

751
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,120
There's another shoe actually

752
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,120
that hasn't dropped yet.

753
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,120
There is another player

754
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,120
out there.

755
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,120
You know,

756
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
there is a really big

757
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
player out there that just

758
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,120
really hasn't

759
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,120
hasn't presented anything yet.

760
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,120
But I have a pretty good feeling

761
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
that something

762
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,120
will present itself

763
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,120
very soon.

764
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
Do you hear that radiator

765
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,120
man that we've got to get

766
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,120
those things?

767
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,120
We've got to,

768
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,120
what is it?

769
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,120
Where is that Roger

770
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
Smalls going through my trashy

771
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,120
hand?

772
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,120
No.

773
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,120
Sounds like it sounds like someone's

774
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,120
dragging a

775
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,120
note,

776
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,120
create a note bottles across the street again.

777
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,120
Since it's just

778
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,120
us podcasters and podcasters

779
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,120
and there's here,

780
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,120
a couple more things.

781
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,120
I do actually want to do

782
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,120
a metro sexual moment.

783
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
But there was some pretty

784
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,120
cool audio feedback

785
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,120
that I got

786
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,120
about advertising.

787
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,120
And I wanted to share that

788
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
with you from Ed Roberts.

789
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,120
Hi, Adam.

790
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,120
This is Ed Roberts from the

791
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,120
Kent City Weather podcast.

792
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,120
You know, I've been doing

793
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,120
some thinking here about

794
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
advertising lately

795
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
as many of us certainly have.

796
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
And I think we're really

797
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
missing out on something

798
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,120
that's really important

799
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,120
when it comes to advertising.

800
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,120
Yes, we definitely need

801
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
to market to something

802
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
that our listeners are going to

803
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,120
be interested.

804
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
Absolutely.

805
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,120
Mark research companies

806
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,120
make millions of

807
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
dollars every year

808
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,120
doing this exact

809
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,120
thing for traditional media.

810
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,120
So the idea certainly

811
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,120
isn't new.

812
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,120
The only difference

813
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,120
is in this respect

814
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
with regards to podcasing

815
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,120
is that podcasters

816
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
can reach a much narrower

817
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,120
and more specific

818
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,120
market than traditional media.

819
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,120
But most importantly,

820
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,120
podcasters have an

821
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,120
intimate camaraderie

822
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,120
with their listeners.

823
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,120
Traditional media has not

824
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
had this for years.

825
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
As a podcaster,

826
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,120
your listeners

827
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,120
respect what you have to say,

828
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
even trust what you

829
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,120
have to say,

830
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,120
which could be kind of

831
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,120
dangerous depending on the

832
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,120
podcasters you listen to.

833
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,120
But they respect you

834
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,120
in the fact that they actually

835
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,120
take the time to listen to you.

836
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,120
If they didn't

837
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
respect you,

838
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,120
they would not listen.

839
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,120
In a way,

840
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,120
you can kind of compare

841
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,120
a podcaster talking about

842
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
a product they enjoy

843
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,120
or even more importantly,

844
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,120
a product they use.

845
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,120
You can kind of compare

846
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
that to celebrity

847
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
endorsements,

848
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,120
at least what they were

849
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,120
supposed to be when they first

850
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,120
started.

851
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
Here's a person

852
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,120
that you respect,

853
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,120
and that you consider

854
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,120
maybe even knowledgeable,

855
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,120
talking about

856
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,120
and using a product

857
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,120
that they enjoy.

858
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,120
Hey, you know what?

859
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,120
If it's good enough for them,

860
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,120
you might be good enough

861
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,120
for me.

862
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,120
If they tested out

863
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,120
and really seem to enjoy it,

864
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,120
maybe I should do the same.

865
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,120
And really,

866
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,120
your listeners doing

867
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,120
the same type of thing

868
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,120
back to you or to your

869
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
other listeners,

870
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,120
does the very same thing.

871
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,120
This is

872
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,120
social networking

873
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,120
and it's fine.

874
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
A social networking

875
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,120
monetized.

876
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,120
Well,

877
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,120
I just want to stop

878
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
at that for a second.

879
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
This is social networking

880
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,120
monetized.

881
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,120
Interesting concept,

882
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,120
like that.

883
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,120
That's really what it is.

884
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,120
And that's what I believe

885
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,120
the future of advertising

886
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,120
is.

887
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,120
And generic,

888
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,120
one of the mil

889
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,120
blast you with

890
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,120
whatever type of advertising

891
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,120
simply does not work

892
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,120
in that type of environment.

893
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,120
It's not really

894
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
fair to your listeners

895
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,120
and in a way,

896
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,120
it's not really

897
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,120
fair to your advertisers

898
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,120
as they're really

899
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,120
not getting the full benefit

900
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,120
of what advertising

901
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,120
and podcasting can do.

902
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,120
And it also

903
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,120
required a bit with the feedback

904
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,120
that you played back

905
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,120
in episode

906
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,120
310 of the daily source code

907
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,120
talking about how we just

908
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,120
filter out

909
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,120
generic advertising

910
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
and to be honest,

911
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,120
I do that

912
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,120
with the earthling stuff

913
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,120
quite frequently,

914
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,120
actually.

915
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,120
And it gets worse

916
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,120
with the

917
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,120
broadcast across

918
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,120
the pod show spectrum.

919
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,120
I've seen several studies

920
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,120
here recently

921
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,120
that say,

922
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,120
you know,

923
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
those in the

924
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,120
18 to 35

925
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,120
age range,

926
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
which is prime target

927
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
for advertisers

928
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,120
that they have a pretty

929
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
highly sensitive

930
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,120
to BS detector.

931
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,120
And those kind of

932
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,120
advertisements

933
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,120
certainly follow

934
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,120
those links.

935
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,120
So we really need to

936
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,120
figure out how to

937
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,120
make that work.

938
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,120
And I really think

939
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,120
that needs to come from the pod

940
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,120
caster

941
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,120
or your family of listeners.

942
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,120
Shoot.

943
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,120
I was at the store today

944
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,120
and found myself

945
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,120
buying one of those

946
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,120
M3 Power Rangers.

947
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
Goodness.

948
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,120
Anyway,

949
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,120
keep up the good work.

950
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,120
If any of your listeners

951
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,120
happen to live in the

952
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,120
Kansas City area,

953
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
make sure you check out

954
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,120
my podcast at caseyweather.org.

955
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,120
I'll be hitting episode 300

956
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,120
here on January 7th.

957
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,120
So I'm catching up to

958
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,120
their Adam.

959
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,120
Good luck.

960
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,120
Right on it.

961
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,120
Thank you very much.

962
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,120
So yeah,

963
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,120
of course,

964
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,120
what you need to find for that

965
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,120
is also advertisers who

966
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,120
are open to that.

967
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,120
Advertisers are usually

968
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,120
a pretty conservative

969
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,120
bunch.

970
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,120
They spend a lot of money.

971
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,120
There's a very little way

972
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
to recognize how

973
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,120
stuff is working.

974
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
Except on,

975
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,120
you know,

976
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,120
the whole industry,

977
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,120
of course, is based on a whole

978
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,120
bunch of bullshit.

979
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,120
Statistics like

980
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,120
arbitron like Nielsen.

981
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,120
In an

982
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,120
own way,

983
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,120
banner advertising,

984
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,120
you know,

985
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,120
you really just can't

986
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,120
quantify it down.

987
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,120
You know,

988
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,120
the big dream of being able to

989
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,120
know exactly what's

990
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,120
happening everywhere

991
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,120
at every minute,

992
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,120
you know,

993
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,120
that is never appeared.

994
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,120
And that's not going to happen

995
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
because of just how,

996
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,120
you know,

997
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,120
the network just is not a

998
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,120
constant state across all clients

999
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,120
and all servers all the time.

1000
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,120
You've got proxy servers

1001
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,120
and all kinds of

1002
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,120
routing and firewalls and

1003
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,120
asynchronous communications.

1004
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,120
They're really just don't

1005
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,120
allow the tracking that

1006
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,120
advertises or marketers were

1007
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,120
promised,

1008
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,120
I think quite honestly,

1009
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,120
by techies.

1010
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,120
The probably is far back

1011
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,120
as as the mid 90's

1012
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,120
when the first dot com

1013
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,120
stuff really started to happen.

1014
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,120
So it will come down to that

1015
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,120
relationship.

1016
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,120
And it will come down to.

1017
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,120
Um,

1018
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,120
solidifying that relationship

1019
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,120
with your listeners.

1020
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,120
And that's why I like this

1021
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,120
concept of a registered listener.

1022
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,120
Um,

1023
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,120
Do it.

1024
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,120
If you were registered

1025
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,120
with your listeners,

1026
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,120
we could have eventually

1027
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,120
gone to your let.

1028
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,120
And, you know,

1029
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,120
had them send a,

1030
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,120
an M3 power

1031
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,120
razor tester kit to any

1032
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,120
registered listener who

1033
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,120
raised their hand.

1034
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,120
You know,

1035
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,120
hey, that will be pretty

1036
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120
fucking beneficial.

1037
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,120
For you,

1038
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
for me and for them.

1039
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,120
Metro,

1040
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,120
you know,

1041
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,120
Metro,

1042
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,120
Metro,

1043
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,120
Metro,

1044
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,120
Metro,

1045
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,120
Metro,

1046
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,120
Metro,

1047
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,120
Metro,

1048
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,120
Metro,

1049
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,120
Metro,

1050
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,120
Metro,

1051
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,120
Metro,

1052
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,120
And I really do appreciate it.

1053
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,120
Thank you for taking the time to send in some

1054
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,120
audio comments on today's

1055
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,120
Metro sexual my Adam.

1056
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,120
This is Luke.

1057
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,120
I never comment about the topic of

1058
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,120
skin conditioning that you've been speaking of

1059
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,120
during the Metro sexual moment.

1060
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,120
What happened to me is totally preventable.

1061
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,120
I live in an area,

1062
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,120
not known for much son,

1063
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,120
Seattle.

1064
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,120
And I'm in IT,

1065
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,120
which means I don't have a window in my office.

1066
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,120
I don't son Bay,

1067
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,120
then I've never been in Tanymuth.

1068
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:39,560
But last year I was diagnosed with skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, it's referred

1069
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,120
to the as the easy cancer.

1070
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,120
What I thought was just a pimple that had never healed quite right is now a 4 inch scar

1071
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,120
above my left eyebrow.

1072
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,000
When I go outside, I have to dress like the invisible man.

1073
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,120
Some protective clothing, gloves, a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, and the ever-present

1074
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,120
sunscreen.

1075
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,760
I'd like to encourage listeners to the DSC, both men and women.

1076
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,240
Then when they look into skin conditioners and moisturizers, to try and look for at least

1077
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:11,880
an SPF-15 in his multi-spectrum, it means it covers both UVA and UVB, or to use sunscreen

1078
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,920
and not just when they go to the beach or the pool, and definitely not just in the summer.

1079
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,280
My hope is that ensuring this, that one person out there won't hear the doctor say, it's

1080
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,920
positive.

1081
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,120
For more information, please check out www.skincancer.org.

1082
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,120
Right on, dude.

1083
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,120
Thank you.

1084
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,480
I've bombed out the Metrosexual moment there for a second, and hopefully that bites.

1085
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:40,120
But okay, heat of warning there, make sure you look out for moisturizers, et cetera, products

1086
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,760
that do have some sun protection factor in that, and that, of course, has been backed

1087
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,120
up by many doctors and many studies.

1088
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,120
Hi, Adam.

1089
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,880
This is Andy Bellittle from the AndyCast podcast at AndyCast.net, and I've got a little

1090
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,280
something for your Metrosexual moment.

1091
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,280
Go right.

1092
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,280
Hello there.

1093
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,280
This is Bunsen, how do you do it?

1094
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,280
AndyCast Labs.

1095
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,280
Personal hygiene division.

1096
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,280
I'm here with my good friend, Beaker.

1097
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:05,560
We were given the task of finding the best disposable razor for today's Metrosexual

1098
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,560
man.

1099
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,640
We found there to be no clear type winner, but there are some critical messages that

1100
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,640
need to be told.

1101
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,920
First of all, the lady's chick has estrogen implanted in it.

1102
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,640
She let Razor, has progesterone, and the vibrating extension in the vibrating razor is nothing

1103
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,640
for any man to eat.

1104
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:30,880
Some of the things that we found within Beaker did some testing was some breast tenderness.

1105
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,880
Did you see, baby?

1106
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,880
Desired to go shopping.

1107
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,920
A constant question about the size of what's asked in a pair of jeans.

1108
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,360
This has been Bunsen, how do you do from AndyCast Labs?

1109
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:46,800
I hope that put a smile on your face at him, happy new year to you, and love the daily

1110
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,800
source code.

1111
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,800
This is Andy Bellittle from the AndyCast podcast at edicast.net.

1112
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,800
Alright, do thank you very much.

1113
00:39:52,800 --> 00:40:01,960
Okay, and then the kicker for today, I'm really excited about this.

1114
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:07,960
Matthias Berser from Germany, first he sent in his tips, he says, instead of using foam

1115
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,720
or cream to shave, are you shaving oil, you've talked about that before, it's hard to get

1116
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,640
in Germany, says where I live, but available in boots stores all over the UK, so give

1117
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,640
it a try.

1118
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,640
Well, I will shaving oil.

1119
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:22,480
My favorite is summer sets shaving oil, but King of Shave is also great.

1120
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,880
I basically oil, it's basically all the rub your wet face with instead of foam or gel,

1121
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,360
but you can also combine those products.

1122
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,080
One advantage of you do not combine them is you'll be moisturized by the shaving oil

1123
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,200
and when your finish just dry your face done.

1124
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,800
Oh yeah, and you can also use together with electric shaves.

1125
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,680
I don't know, man, I think you should still moisturize even after you do all that.

1126
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,760
Now here's the, the, he's the got me really excited.

1127
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,360
The company I work for says Matthias Berser, high tech electron lithography tools.

1128
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:52,240
One of the core components is a scanning electron microscope which can be used to make

1129
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,480
quite high magnification images.

1130
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,840
Maybe I'm able to put some razor blades in and we can find the differences between

1131
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,840
the ones which come with the razor and the replacement blades.

1132
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,280
Also, some of the tools are equipped with a device called EDX and short this can give you

1133
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,920
information about material composition with a resolution of about one micron.

1134
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,400
So what do you think?

1135
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,280
My only problem right now is I broke my wrist no boarding after Christmas and I'm home

1136
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,400
sick, but happy listen plenty of podcasts since I have the time.

1137
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,080
No promises when I can do the experiment.

1138
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,120
Well, Matthias, no problem, my friend, can't wait to hear the results of that.

1139
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,600
Yeah, I think you should take it down to a micron level and find out if there is a difference.

1140
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:31,120
If those scumbags are given us great blades in the pre-sale pack and shitty replacements,

1141
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,120
be nice to know.

1142
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:37,120
Okay.

1143
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,120
Oh my goodness, what are we doing?

1144
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,240
I 41 almost 42 minutes, great.

1145
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,240
Okay.

1146
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,160
And that is the Metro sectional moment for today for Friday.

1147
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,120
It is the 6th of January, 2006.

1148
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,120
The next time we speak to each other will be from the Curry condo in San Francisco,

1149
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:59,560
it will be there for almost two weeks, so it is going to be quite a shift on the oil rig.

1150
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:03,120
And I'm going to miss the girls, obviously.

1151
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:09,200
Thank you all so much, by the way, for sending in your links to videos, videos cut to

1152
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,200
pod safe music, lots of videographers, people who have video editing tools, interested in

1153
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,200
the concept.

1154
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,480
Okay, this is what I want to do.

1155
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:23,280
I want to think about setting up something similar to the pod safe music network and have

1156
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,360
some kind of relationship between the two.

1157
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,360
I think this is all going to be a part of the unlabel as we discussed yesterday, so let's

1158
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:35,960
just don't stop experimenting, but I got to think on how we can mold or shape or put this

1159
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,960
together.

1160
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,960
I would love to have your input.

1161
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:44,240
I think we need a place where videographers, this really comes down to the unlabel.

1162
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,240
It really does.

1163
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,720
The videographers can make videos for a pod safe music tune.

1164
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,000
You of course, you could have multiple videos for it.

1165
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,240
Something that can be shared around, something that can be distributed, and the concept

1166
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:02,240
would be that people would get interested, would buy something, buy a CD or some merchandise

1167
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:08,920
or a track or whatever, and then the maker of the music video that instigated the purchase

1168
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,240
would get a piece of it.

1169
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:16,120
But that's, we got to fit all that together, and of course, it's never 100% accurate,

1170
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:23,400
and you can't really, as far as I know, it's not going to be very easy to track people

1171
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:29,520
from their devices through to a purchasing affiliate system, but let's work on it, because

1172
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,400
I think there is something there, and I think music videos, which originally were known

1173
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:39,680
as promo clips, video music promo clip, it's really what it used to be known as.

1174
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:46,680
It was a promo clip, it was to promote the video, and it's still used to promote the song,

1175
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,680
really.

1176
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,320
The video is used to promote the song.

1177
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,400
So there's something there, something there for sure, I've got to think about it.

1178
00:43:53,400 --> 00:44:01,160
Let's see, this is Betty Loveette from the Pod save music network, down to zero.

1179
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:16,160
What the feeling, when you're feeling, your step and light lift making your number

1180
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:28,280
one, down to zero, with a word to leave them, one of the ones, now I am walking which

1181
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:38,280
will feel that down on the ground, down to the ground, down to the ground.

1182
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:49,880
All the way down to the ground, round new demand, first glassing steel, just flows through

1183
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:56,480
the crowd, walks off with your man, send you rushing through the mirror, rush back

1184
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:03,480
out and say, there's no beauty in you, then get it one, all the rhythm of when

1185
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:10,480
I walk the warm sense beside you, more than your heel, little waves come rushing

1186
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,480
in.

1187
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:18,480
So take the word from your head, thin again, never again, she'll put you up alone, then

1188
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,480
you're hot and stiff, then you fall.

1189
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:31,480
You're gonna know how to steal more grind, when you're thinking about your mama's

1190
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:39,480
own this song, taking to your bed, think you're fine, eating, sleeping, but you dream

1191
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:49,480
of nothing but love and sin, and gonna hard hit you fine, can bring more pain than

1192
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:59,480
love, listen, listen, who would you fall, when you fall, when you fall.

1193
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:31,480
You know how to steal more grind, when you're thinking about your mama's own listen,

1194
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:38,480
take it to your bed, think you're fine, eating, sleeping, but you dream of nothing but love

1195
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:48,480
and sin, oh, when you fall, when you fall, when you fall.

1196
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:55,480
All at my door.

1197
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:01,480
Ready to live at, down to zero, from Epitaph Records, one of the many record companies who

1198
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:06,480
have joined the Podsafe Music Revolution, and it's real simple how it works, you go look at

1199
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,480
the show notes for a podcast, who plays music from the Podsafe Music Network.

1200
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,480
If you hear something you like, go to the show notes from the show notes, you should be able

1201
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,480
to link straight to the artist's page and the Podsafe Music Network from there.

1202
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,480
You can find out about them, listen, other songs, of course, links to their own websites.

1203
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,480
They might even have their own podcasts, places to buy, and very soon hopefully a purchase

1204
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,480
tag right there so you can buy the track or buy the album by some melts.

1205
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,480
Hey, everybody, have a great weekend.

1206
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,480
I'll be traveling.

1207
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,480
I will talk to you again on Monday from Curricondo in San Francisco.

1208
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,480
Bye-bye.

1209
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:47,480
Potcho.com makes no claims regarding the quality of its pod shows or the sanity of its producers.

1210
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,480
Listen at your own risk.
