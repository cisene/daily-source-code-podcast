96
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,600
from the affluent suburb of Surrey known as Gilford in the United Kingdom. A beautiful day

97
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,120
and we're inside doing our stuff. Lots of stuff today. In fact, recording a show with Christina.

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,280
A new show, B.G. Blasts. So looking forward to that. And it's kind of running down stuff that

99
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,640
you guys have been sending me. All kinds of different comments. I think we're kind of over the moon

100
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:55,200
stuff now. Over the moon landings and still some ideas about how to make certain chemicals come

101
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,600
up with highly high explosives. I really love this educated audience. You guys are you sending

102
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,040
all this cool stuff that it's just so fun to try out at home or was September coming?

103
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,200
You might even want to try this at the podcast expo. Hey, their daily source code listener. This is

104
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,840
KFC the pod check. How many times have you thought to yourself? Hmm. I'd like to see my favorite

105
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,160
pod casting personality thrown out of a plane at more than 14,000 feet above the earth,

106
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,720
plummeting down to their depth. And then just kidding, we'll give them a parachute.

107
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:37,360
Let the games begin sending your names now of who you'd like to see tossed out. KFC at podcheck.com.

108
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:44,880
Make them smile. Oh, yes, we will. I love that idea pod check. Yeah, if you've never seen what pod

109
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:53,040
check does, go over to podcheck.com. She's got some awesome videos that she's been working on of

110
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,960
basically hot girls jumping out of airplanes. It's something about it that totally totally gets me.

111
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,680
I'm loving it. So yeah, that's a pretty good idea. Who would we? What podcaster would we want

112
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:11,920
throw out of an airplane? 14,000 feet? Hello. Hello. Hi, babe. I have more food. Yeah,

113
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,600
well, I just started the show. I know what I saw. Do you need me more food? Thank you.

114
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,040
Nice crispy. I don't want to throw up being thrown out of a plane. What? I don't want to be

115
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,240
go. Go talk in front of the microphone so we can hear your ass. What's wrong with the microphone?

116
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,720
How come it's not working? I don't know. I heard you and I said, you said, oh, so cool. Yeah,

117
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,280
girls jumping out of a plane. Hot chicks jumping out of a plane. Hot chicks jumping out of a plane.

118
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,880
Okay, well, that's the thing I don't want to do. No, you're not invited. No. No. I want to stay in.

119
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,440
So no worries, babe. No, okay. So damn. You don't even want to fly with me. Right, this I do.

120
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,640
Just not over the water. Well, yes, I will, but you know, step by step because

121
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,760
don't trust me. Well, years and years ago, I didn't even want to go in a little plane like you have

122
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:10,320
right now. That's a little plane. Well, I mean, you know, planes like that. I said, I swear to

123
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,840
everybody, I'm never going to go in a plane like that. And I'm doing that now, so I'm going to be a

124
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:23,440
very brave. Yeah, I forced him. I'm going to get out of here. No, no, no, it's great. But, you know,

125
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,320
step by step, it's quite a long journey. So we'll get you out of the plane soon with it, with a pair of

126
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,280
hands. And then after that, you're probably pushed me out of the plane. Oh, please.

127
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,960
All right, by hand, you coming on tomorrow? I enjoy your sandwiches. Thank you. You're going to come on tomorrow?

128
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,040
Yeah. Okay. All right, baby. Love you. Love you, too. Yeah, good.

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,120
Hey, this is Scott with the Alaska Pod Show Adam. How are you? I was just catching up on my

130
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,400
DSEs. And I was listening to Triple Four. I fully expect by the end of the year, the price of

131
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,880
a barrel of oil crude oil to go up to $100. Mark my words right now. I said it August 18th, 2006,

132
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,680
by the end of the year, a barrel of oil will probably be about $100. You know, there was a huge

133
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:11,440
disaster in Alaska. Did you know that? I think they, um, there's 200, 200,000 barrels a day

134
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:19,520
they were coming out of Alaska. Who's doing that, was it? I can't remember which company was this

135
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,320
only a couple, of course. So they had to shut down because they were leaking shit into the sound

136
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:30,240
again. And of course, Alaska can't handle that. If Alaska has another exon disaster, Alaska will be,

137
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:38,640
basically dead. Okay, I was pretty excited to hear you talk about this. The oil spill situation

138
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,560
actually took place in Prudobay, which sits just across from the heavily debated Arctic National

139
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,760
Wildlife Refuge or Anwar. It was BP British petroleum who had not maintained their oil pipes that

140
00:08:51,840 --> 00:09:00,400
feed into the trans Alaska pipeline since 1992. As a result, this past March, the largest leak

141
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:07,360
in the Norse low production history took place as much as 267,000 gallons of oil

142
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,920
poured out of the pipeline for five days straight before being discovered. The moral of the story here

143
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,760
out of my think is if we want to take control of the price of oil, we need to take a firm position

144
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:25,600
with oil companies like BP. And we do that through voting, who we place in office in our

145
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,800
states to help advocate for oil exploration, but to be done safely. So none of this happens because

146
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,120
we are paying for this at the pump. And I was quite honestly shocked to hear that BP was involved

147
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,120
in this and that they admitted their fault. They market themselves here in Alaska on a daily basis

148
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,280
on television as a forward thinking company and as green as can be. A hundred bucks, a barrel

149
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:57,040
sure. This spill we had is going to make it very hard to do further drilling and exploration in the

150
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,560
Norse slope. And you know, I could go on here Adam. I don't want to take up too much of your time.

151
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,880
If you're interested, show 100 is a good place to start Alaska.podshow.com to hear more. Take

152
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:17,440
care yourselves and yeah. Folder. Of course. Bye bye. I'm so sorry I'm being very disgusting here.

153
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,800
I have my mouth full. I almost made it. Wait, let's do a jingle. I finish up my sandwich, okay?

154
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:45,360
Right, um, Harper's Bazaar. A lot of people sent me this has in their September issue an excerpt

155
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:54,320
from diary of a lost girl, the memoirs of Colah Booth, a former writer for the days of our lives.

156
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,960
Who claims? That's the soap opera, right? Who claims that she was once. Oh, so I'm going to be

157
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:07,040
in Laden's sex slave in this. Booth says that bin Laden was obsessed with Whitney Houston.

158
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,560
And desperately somehow wanted to arrange to meet her. In his briefcase, she said, I would come

159
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,920
across photographs of star magazine as well as copies of Playboy. I would soon come to the point

160
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,000
where I was sick of hearing Whitney Houston's name, Booth writes, hang the bin Laden would go on

161
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,960
about how beautiful she is, what a nice smile she has, how truly Islamic she is, but it's just

162
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:34,160
brainwashed by American culture and by her husband Bobby Brown. Oh, man. Why didn't Osama bin Laden take

163
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,120
Bobby Brown out? And then let me, let me would have been getting somewhere, you know what I mean?

164
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,400
Yeah, Adam. I have a question which may qualify for a tin foil hat moment. Well, hold on a second.

165
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,280
Let's do it properly.

166
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:04,400
And now it's time for the tin foil hat moment. All right. Better be good then.

167
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:10,400
I want those listeners of podcast who doesn't actually listen to them on a portable MP3 player.

168
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:16,000
I listen to podcasts on my PC. My problem is that I haven't yet found a player, which is a

169
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,840
resume feature. I listen to podcasts and music during my workday, and whether I'm listening with

170
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,800
iTunes or Windows media player, if I'm in the middle of a podcast when I need to leave my

171
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,080
computer at the end of the day, I have to write down what time code I'm up to, so I can continue

172
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,520
from the same point the next day. This obviously isn't a problem for three-minute music track,

173
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,600
but with podcasts of 40 minutes to an hour, I have to do this regularly.

174
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,160
So I'm asking you and your listeners, do you know of a player which you can resume where you left

175
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:54,240
off last time in the 11 MP3 file? I realise it's not the end of the world to have to write it down,

176
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,800
but it's literally the only thing that isn't perfect in my podcast listening experience.

177
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,800
Any pointers would be appreciated. As a listener, I would like to mention one of my favorite

178
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:12,080
podcasts, one up yours, which discuss his games on all platforms. I'm not a heavy game player myself,

179
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:17,200
but these guys obviously have a lot of fun arguing with each other, and it's entertaining every week.

180
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,800
Thanks for the Charlie. Finally. Scruncher.

181
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,600
I write Christine. Thank you so much. Well, I think it's pretty valid tinfoil had moment question.

182
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,760
Now, I believe that the actual MP3 format doesn't really lend itself that well to bookmarking.

183
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,760
Of course, there's the enhanced audio format from Apple, which I believe actually the podshow player

184
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:49,200
can handle. If you are listening to, you can actually listen to an AAC.

185
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,760
I'm pretty sure I'll have to check this after the show. I'm pretty sure you can listen to an AAC.

186
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,120
The pictures will show up and you click on the picture and I'll take you to the link of whatever's

187
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:07,360
linked to it. Any quick time-based format, I believe, like a quick time movie, so video will

188
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,480
you can enhance that with the URLs, with the bookmarks. I think we can handle all that, but the actual

189
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:19,920
closing of a window that has a player in it, and window being a web browser, and then reopening

190
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,680
that, and remembering where you were, I think that is a pretty big technical challenge, actually.

191
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,520
It would have to have some kind of cashed information on your machine.

192
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,000
Maybe, first of all, I presume anything is possible, but I haven't seen anyone actually do it.

193
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,520
So if you know a player that can handle that, or the system, and quite honestly, I would think

194
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:46,720
that we should be able to do that inside podshow plus, because podshow plus is pretty much based

195
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,760
around two forms of listening or viewing, doing that right there at your computer or subscribing

196
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,160
to a show or to channels of shows or collections of shows, whatever you want it to be,

197
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,040
so that those can go automatically to your hard drive or to your iPod, through iTunes,

198
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,920
whatever you need it to do. Let me know if you have any solution for that for bookmarking

199
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,920
with a player inside a web page.

200
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,080
Let's conclude this tinfoil hide moment.

201
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,640
Let's see three pieces of email from the inbox.

202
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,720
Oh, okay, this is a, this is from Brian No, from the, oh, have you ever heard the No Zone yet?

203
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:44,000
Brian Show? You'll like it. It really kicks ass. He sent me this link to a page on MSNBC.com.

204
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,680
I'll just read the highlights and anonymous senior British official knowledgeable about the

205
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,440
quote, Hair Joe bombers told NBC that there was no threat to airplanes last week.

206
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,960
The terrorists have been under surveillance for over a year, and the UK government didn't plan

207
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,280
on arresting these guys until it surveyed them a while longer, but moved when they,

208
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,440
when they did because of U.S. pressure in contrast to previous reports, the official

209
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,720
suggests that the attack was not imminent saying the suspects had not yet purchased any

210
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,240
airline tickets. In fact, some did not even have passports. I'm sure this is going to be circling around

211
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,840
the internet for a couple more weeks. Just kind of puts an interesting, interesting twist on anything

212
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:24,240
on, on to everything about how the UK and the U.S. are working together. Timothy Freywin

213
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:30,480
in response to how do you actually make liquid explosives that you can carry that could really

214
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,120
blow up an airplane? He says, dude, haven't you seen diehard three? All they need is what

215
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,400
it looks like a carton of Rebeena and a bottle of Avion and Presto, you got one hell of a bomb.

216
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,320
You know, the red liquid and the clear liquid that are completely safe until mixed together.

217
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,840
U.P. K.A. motherfucker? That's what Tim says. And this was kind of funny.

218
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,680
There's a, I love it when you, you know, this is something that you get in the radio industry

219
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:05,760
all the time. You get emails and all kinds of communication from PR agents who are looking to

220
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,520
promote, usually it's authors of books. And so the subject line at the email says,

221
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,720
a radio interview opportunity, experts to reveal the hidden dangers of my space.

222
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,680
So Kate Richie sends this to me. And so it's basically it's a pitch to get this person on a radio

223
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,040
show. So in this case, I guess you're sending it to podcasts, which I think is pretty smart.

224
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:36,800
67 million my space users are more at risk than they know. The new myspace.com the new myspace.com

225
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,440
social networking phenomenon has become the focus of recent headlines with an average of 250,000

226
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,120
new members daily. It is the latest internet fad already. I don't like the way she's communicating.

227
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:53,520
But what she's saying is that there can be at least 30 different kinds of spyware programs

228
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,680
that are on my space that obviously, you know, spyware can really mess up your computer.

229
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,600
And she's almost insinuating in this entire email that, you know, myspace might even know

230
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,760
something about it. And of course, there's this expert you can talk to about. I'm sure he's either

231
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,480
one of the, what is he prepping? What is his deal? Let me see what the guy's name is. The guy's name is

232
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,360
sorry. I'm so lame. I didn't have all this, uh, prep's. Schron. What's the guy? That's his last name.

233
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,640
Schron is a lively entertaining guest for our familiar typical computer geek. He's engaging.

234
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,600
Oh, going and we'll light up the switchboard as he educates and advises your listeners to

235
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,880
engage in safe PC actions. Maybe bullshit, but it'll be perfect for another tinfoil hat moment.

236
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,640
Let me know if, uh, if there is indeed some form of huge risk with the way myspace operates with spyware.

237
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,760
Accured.podshow.com want to mention that. We have a big push for this target cast. It's kind of a

238
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:09,200
new concept. I would basically call it a new version of an infomercial where we were totally telling

239
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,920
you about a product. It's about selling you a product. The main difference is we don't have to do it in,

240
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:20,000
you know, 22 minutes or 30 minutes to rush it in after hours time. We actually can do multiple episodes,

241
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,680
look at all aspects of the creation of the car. And you're more than welcome to interact. There's a

242
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,240
lot of stuff you can do on the, it's a podshow plus plus page. So you can do all the, the normal things

243
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,520
of reviews and comments. Accured.podshow.com. Go check that out. Yes, that I did a clue number two

244
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:42,000
of the, the promo that's a riddle. This English girl calling in, giving me riddles. So I can figure out

245
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,520
what, you know, what the name of the podcast is. I don't know, I'm just playing along so far.

246
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,320
It's been kind of fun. And she gave me a clue yesterday, which I wrote down. I think I wrote it down.

247
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:02,640
Yeah, um, the first letter. Uh, what was it? You know, the clue was what used to be called

248
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,400
fly boys and is now a popular movie. I couldn't come up with it yesterday. But of course, lots of

249
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:16,400
people figured it out really quickly. A-b-r-r. A-b-r-r. A-b-r-r. A-b-r-r. John Glasscock figured it out

250
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:24,400
said it was aviator, um, most of me I've heard, Daniel Smelter, aviator. And then Troy, was it Troy?

251
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:33,120
Yeah, Troy Rutter from Troy needs an op iPod says, hey, uh, a crap. That's not the one I wanted

252
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,160
is it? Someone actually, I thought Troy had figured out what, what it was going to be.

253
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,920
Shoot. All right. I don't know. This is, it's kind of getting boring. And especially because they

254
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,040
didn't send me a third clue today, hurry up. Well, yeah, I have no time for this.

255
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,120
Carl Dearshow. Adam, several times now you've given the voice mail line number,

256
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,280
omitting the one before the 201. So you're saying plus 201. What I really wonder about is whether

257
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,640
this important cabin Egypt whose country code is 202, who's wondering why he's getting all these

258
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,480
calls about scrunchers versus folders. Have you ever tried calling the number to see who's at the

259
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:19,440
other end? Okay. So Carl, who's a scruncher by the way, says that sometimes instead of saying plus

260
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:28,160
one 201 625 6357, that sometimes as a plus 201, which would be the incorrect number and you'd

261
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:33,840
be calling someone in Egypt. So why don't we see? That's a good idea. Actually, hold on. I got, uh,

262
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:51,760
I got Skype a clue up here. Um, can I? Yeah, so we can do plus 201 625 6357. Let's see if anyone picks

263
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:59,840
that up. This'll be cool. No, yeah, I'm using Skype. We'll just say I'm a scruncher folder.

264
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:09,360
Okay. There's your answer, dude. Doesn't work. But luckily, I do have a fix for this problem.

265
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:31,120
Hey Adam, it's Jack Pitts here over at the pitcast.com. Let me start by introducing myself. I'm a

266
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:37,520
father, a husband, and just all downright lover of podcasting in general. Recently a friend of mine

267
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:44,880
and I were having a discussion about podcasting and how he thinks all us podcasts are idiots.

268
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:52,880
More so us podcasts that play music. He also went on about rambling how he thinks that once our cities

269
00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:00,640
are lit up with Wi-Fi that it'll make podcasting obsolete. Now, what does your take on this? Do you

270
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:07,280
think that podcasting will go away? Do to the capability that will allow listeners to be able to

271
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:15,200
just tune into streaming audio such as internet radio stations in their cars, on planes, on trains,

272
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:22,160
or will podcasting just take a different route. Anyhow, inquiring minds want to know and also

273
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:29,520
Adam, thank you for the pod show plus. It's just an awesome site and I'm really digging it and also

274
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,560
folder. Dara. Thanks, dude. Okay. So that's a very good question. We've talked about this before.

275
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,040
What you need is not just blanket Wi-Fi, which of course is going to happen. There's going to be

276
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:44,160
connectivity everywhere you go, except on airplanes made by Boeing because they stopped that service

277
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,240
for whatever reason. Because they say it wasn't working out. Well, I never got to try it.

278
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,560
What will need is new devices. And I think a lot of that is coming out of the cell phone industry,

279
00:23:54,560 --> 00:24:00,400
but there's a real, you know, there's a real conundrum there, which I'll get to in a second. But first of

280
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:08,400
all, podcasting was based on really the advent of having a player that you could take with you

281
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,440
that you at some points would connect up to your computer. And of course, that happened way before

282
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:22,240
the iPod really had some critical mass. And in order to create the illusion of or the ease of

283
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,920
radio, I should say with some extra benefits, it was necessary to be able to get these shows onto

284
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,160
your device without you actually even knowing about it, which, of course, is what iPod are

285
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:39,040
lemon did and still does or juice does, what iTunes does. And yeah, so whenever you connect up

286
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,240
your iPod, just the charge it even, it's going to transfer all of that stuff. Now, of course,

287
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,920
you could be listening to this story on a serious stars 102 and thinking, yeah, okay, so what is the

288
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,160
future hold force? Where's it going to go? Where's all this technology leading us? It's podcasting

289
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:59,440
stupid. Is it dead? Will it continue to find out? You'll have to download the rest of this podcast

290
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,120
at dailysourcecode.com. It's a two for Tuesday. Stay tuned for more on serious. Again, here on the

291
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,280
podcast, we'll continue with that because of course, I know what's going to happen. It's it's very easy.

292
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,440
So let's just step back again two and a two years ago. We needed a way to create this

293
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,480
this ease of use. So people weren't just thinking about iPods as something from music, but

294
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,160
I waited a minute. Here's something else. And all I did is I installed some software and clicked

295
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,320
on a few things. And now, whenever there's a new program from this particular producer, it just

296
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:39,200
shows up onto my iPod. Done for two reasons. One, because bandwidth is still reasonably

297
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,960
problematic. Certainly two years ago, it was tougher than it was now to be able to just

298
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,600
get something on the fly. But you were still tethered to your computer. And I think that's really

299
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,040
where the revolution is is taking this entertainment with you. We've had mobile devices for a

300
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,880
long time. But what's the entertainment stuff? You actually have on these mobile devices? What's

301
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:06,480
pretty poor? It's piss poor, really. And the reason is because, in my humble opinion, the telco operators

302
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,520
have absolutely no incentive to start pushing large volumes of bandwidth around their network.

303
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,280
That, you know, they're happy they can handle the text messaging, the multimedia messaging,

304
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,720
and voice calls. They're just happy that they can handle all that. These things do get

305
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,800
pretty tax when, you know, at peak hours. So there's no incentive for them to start shoving all kinds

306
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:34,080
of data around their, you know, their precious networks. So, you know, the stuff that they,

307
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,800
first of all, they want to tightly control it. So, they know that means compression and

308
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,720
formats, et cetera. So, the gatekeepers of their own networks, which, of course, is fine.

309
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,920
And what do they do? You know, typical big company hooks up with big companies and Hollywood.

310
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,840
And so their repurposing stuff is ring tones, of course, which is extremely successful,

311
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,280
particularly the real ring tones. And they are offering some content now. But it's,

312
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:04,320
there's really, I don't think there's any money in it for the content producer. And, you know,

313
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,000
just doesn't seem like there's an economic model there that is sparking and coming alive.

314
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,040
Otherwise, I'm sure we would be able to see, you know, like MTV on our cell phone 24 hours a day.

315
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:20,560
It just doesn't feel like that's going to happen. Now, for independent producers,

316
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:29,120
I believe most mobile network operators want you to pay to get onto their networks. So,

317
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,000
they just really haven't quite figured that out. And there is something that, to be said,

318
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,480
for, you know, what, what that is their networks is not a part of the public internet.

319
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,080
So, of course, now we're seeing companies like Nokia come out with Wi-Fi built in.

320
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,760
Now, Wi-Fi is still pretty messed up, unfortunately. You know, the, just the whole authenticator,

321
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:56,800
so many, you know, the authentication methods and, excuse me, since I said, I'm willing to

322
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,240
buy a project throwing your favorite podcast right out of an airplane in 14,000 feet.

323
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,240
Check it out at project.com.

324
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:14,160
I'm sorry, distracted myself. So, some of these, you know, the cell phones with Wi-Fi.

325
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,840
I don't know. We've got to come down. It's got to come down to design. It's got to come down to

326
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:26,160
efficiency of these networks. You know, was it, why max may be a future possibility?

327
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,160
Whatever's going to happen, it's going to be all access all the time. And it's going to be fast.

328
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,800
So, you'll literally be able to navigate a menu whether it's an application on your phone or

329
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,440
through a web page or whatever it is, click on something and it'll just start playing because it'll

330
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,680
come in that fast. You know, you can do that already today with most home connections with the

331
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,760
PC and a web browser. You know, you click on something and pretty much the minute the first

332
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,720
couple seconds of data have come in that your player will start to play it, whether it's audio

333
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,440
or video. So, I think that's what we're going to go. And of course, everyone will be able to utilize

334
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,680
this technology. You know, it's, and you'll see that mainstream media will use it as well.

335
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,840
And they're going to get really, really smart. Look at what some of the big television networks

336
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,960
are doing already. They're creating their own little my spaces and YouTube's. So, it's going to

337
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,600
be, it look, there's not going to be a lack of content offered. That's for sure. But what's going to

338
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,720
be new and fresh and different? What are we going to like? And will we have any form of control

339
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,640
over putting that onto our cell phones? I believe so. But it's not going to be through the

340
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,320
mobile network operators. It's going to be through the device makers. Who, of course,

341
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:40,000
are constantly fighting with the operators. If a, if Nokia does something that the cell phone

342
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,200
operators don't like, they just won't order the Nokia phones. You know, that's a pretty heavy

343
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,800
incentive to play nice with each other. It's actually, it's kind of, it's kind of cartelish.

344
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:55,920
You know, it's kind of Microsoft-ish when you think about it. Again, that's not really my problem.

345
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:01,440
We just want to make cool stuff. Enable creative people to get stuff out there and distributed

346
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:08,720
as wide as possible. Hello Adam. This is Chris and Philadelphia of Egladex.com. Two things

347
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,760
for you on your riddle segment that you had. I believe the answer, the first letter would be A,

348
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,360
which is an article that is spoken often. I'm sure you got a bunch of calls about that. And

349
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:28,000
separately, I asked this back into why, but it's around July 4, and you know, have stuff kind of

350
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,880
get lost. Kind of got lost back then. But about this web 2.0, moving all the stuff into, you know,

351
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:43,280
the internet, all the kitchen of the flicker, all your stuff on the online work processors. The

352
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:49,440
question for you is, how often do these things fail? I'm not too worried about big brother looking

353
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,440
in my files, but I am worried about actually a data center going down and loops there goes

354
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:02,880
on my pictures or loops there goes on my art or music or something. Since you are a businessman,

355
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,320
assistant, and maybe know about these things, failing or not. Just trying to need a little more

356
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:16,720
confidence in how often these data centers fail. So hoping to get back to me, good show,

357
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,320
and one more thing, reformed folder. Thanks to you, Adam. Bye bye. Good to have you on board,

358
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:30,160
my buddy. Well, you know, this is kind of like saying, will airplanes crash? Of course,

359
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:36,640
they will. Will big data ware housing systems crash? Of course, they will. Now, I think it's really

360
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:42,000
becoming kind of you. Oh, there's that word. You big with us. It just really doesn't matter anymore.

361
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,240
You know, where the stuff is on your hard drive, where the stuff is out there somewhere on a

362
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,280
server on the net. It almost doesn't make any difference. Yeah, you know, big files, some files,

363
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,760
it isn't really appropriate to access them. If you have to access them a lot, you may want to just

364
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,680
be a tad bit faster on your on your local hard drive. But that's really the way you got to view

365
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,960
with these things are big hard drives with with the web-based front ends. Now, I store my pictures

366
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:12,320
on Flickr. Why? Because I know they have a backup policy. I know that, well, you know,

367
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:18,160
I know about their own by Yahoo, so I think they're going to be around for a while. Obviously,

368
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:24,480
the smart thing here to do is to have a backup, a local backup. But, you know, your question is

369
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,240
right. One thing I know is with my stuff stored on Flickr, my stuff stored, like Gmail, I use

370
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,720
exclusively for all my email, all of my audio and video output to create the final mixes and

371
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,760
creations, at least are stored on the PDN Pod Show Plus. Any one of those, of course, could have

372
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:49,920
some catastrophic event. But in most cases, well, we even had this a couple of weekends ago. Remember

373
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55,680
when I something went wrong and there was like a basic delete Pod Show button and it erased

374
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:02,320
400 gigs of content. Well, of course, we had a backup. It took us, well, it took a crazy

375
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,640
ass a long time to get everything backed up. Back onto the hard drives, a restored, I should say.

376
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,320
But, you know, we have a backup because that's a professional facility. Now, do you create

377
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:20,480
backups at home? On your from your PC, you may, most people don't. I'm notoriously bad at it.

378
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,560
But I'll tell you, I've had zero data data loss from data centers and services on the internet

379
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:31,200
in the past couple years, in the past three years. But in the past three years, I have had three

380
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:40,640
computers, Mac power books I might add, have the drive crash totally and I've lost some actual data.

381
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,920
So that's kind of what you got to look at. But as I said, you know, this ties into this whole

382
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,840
everything connected everywhere. I'm pretty sure that we're going to be doing quite a lot of

383
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:55,520
storing our stuff in other places. The real clue is not about the backup policies. I'm pretty

384
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,840
sure that that's going to be okay. But how can you integrate it all? How can you take something

385
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:06,320
that you have posted on Pod Show and how can you add that somewhere else? Not just within Pod Show,

386
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,280
but how can you add that to the Pod Save Music Network and vice versa and how can you

387
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,440
move that over to my space? There's a lot of people working on these things.

388
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,120
I think it's a Mark Canter doing the people aggregator, which is a very confusing name to me.

389
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:26,000
But I think he's always talking about how we should be able to connect flicker to my space and

390
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,480
et cetera. And I'm keeping an eye on that because I love it. I love it when you can integrate

391
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,400
with other applications, other technologies. Even this said this video program that I've been using

392
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:41,120
to create a perversion for profit, my video podcast. I have another one almost ready to go by

393
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:46,640
the way. It's just a little more complicated than doing an audio podcast. There's a lot of

394
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:57,120
transcoating and conversions. And of course, the hair and makeup. But even that program, which is

395
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:03,120
a visual communicator studio. It has 15 different ways to output. So I'm already talking to them saying

396
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:08,240
hey, why don't you just make it so you can output right to the podcast delivery network. It's what

397
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,600
we call an open API. You can hook right into it and have your customers post it right up. There's

398
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,720
your storage, your bandwidth, your show notes, everything all goes. And it's done. It's published.

399
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:25,760
I love it when stuff like that is possible. So you all reminded me diligently that I was going

400
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,720
that I wanted to play Carmen Tyler. And of course Carmen picked up on it too. And I've been asking

401
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:38,400
for naked pictures. She sent me a picture, which is of her as Miss Louisiana. And this is with her

402
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:49,840
blue dress off the shoulder and a crown. That's great. This was what she said. It was like,

403
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:55,760
I want you to send me an email here. Was it like 10 years ago or something like that?

404
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:03,120
I don't remember. Carmen without a doubt is beautiful. She has a beautiful voice. She's uploaded

405
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:11,760
some new tracks, songs that were written by David Patillo. He wrote 10,000 Angel's cried,

406
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,080
which Lee Ann Ryan's recorded a couple of years back. But there's another song that she's had

407
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,600
up there for quite a while on the podcast, music network. Obviously, linked to it in today's show

408
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,400
notes at dailysourcecode.com. And it's a song that you never ever hear on the radio. You don't

409
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,480
only hear it in church typically or at a funeral, which is maybe why not a lot of people like

410
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,800
the song. But this is a song that's known the world over and people absolutely love it for

411
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,960
for different reasons. And maybe just, you know, it's not really like a real Charlie song,

412
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,080
but I'll just play it. And I want to accompany that with a poem.

413
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:54,560
Yesterday from my sister Willow and Adely, she sent me, she sent me this email and she said,

414
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:00,960
I was looking for mom's manuscript, Dead Grow's the Ivy. I didn't know that she had a manuscript

415
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,760
called Dead Grow's the Ivy, which by the way, Willow says she couldn't find. But she found this poem

416
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:13,600
amongst her files. And she also enclosed the original word document, which was created September

417
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:23,520
9th, 2004. So this is before my mom found out about her cancerous tumor.

418
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,400
So I want to share this with you because you guys have been along for the ride for the past couple

419
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:36,560
years. And I want to play the song by Carmen Tyler. Here we go. It's called Miss Me but let me go.

420
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:44,560
When I come to the end of the road and the son has set for me, I want no rights in the gloom-filled

421
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:52,640
room. Why cry for a soul set free? Miss Me a little but not too long and not with your head

422
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:59,920
bowed low. Remember the love that we once shared, Miss Me, but let me go. For this is a journey

423
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:06,400
we almost take and each must go alone. It's all a part of the master plan, a step on the road

424
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:13,760
to home. So when you are lonely and feeling sad, go to the friends we knew and bury your sorrows

425
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:22,320
and do in good deeds. Miss Me, but let me go.

426
00:38:36,400 --> 00:39:06,240
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound and that saved our ranch like me.

427
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:36,080
I want was lost, oh by now I found that was blind, oh by now I'll see

428
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,400
you.

429
00:39:47,200 --> 00:40:06,320
The remaining dangers, tolls and snails. I have already

430
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:36,160
caught his grace that's all my heart to feel and grace will lead me home.

431
00:40:36,320 --> 00:41:03,280
I believe in death, and now, 10,000 years, but I shine in us, the same

432
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:26,400
way we've known. Let's dance, to sing, to sing God's praise, then when we first

433
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:54,640
we go, then when we first we go on, on the roof of the city,

434
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:06,320
rag!

435
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,740
One in the last time you actually sat in listen to that song.

436
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:20,840
Pretty damn nice. Thank you very much feeding rays amazing voice. Amazing beauty.

437
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,040
beauty. I still use it since I'm naked pictures.

438
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,840
