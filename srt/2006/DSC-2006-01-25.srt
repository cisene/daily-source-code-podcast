1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Delta Sierra Charlie, three, two, three.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped my ass.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Today's news!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We don't mean us thinking crazy.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm just kidding.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's so curry.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Today's source code is on coming here from the Curry Connage and say a cold.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And someone missed me foggy today.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You're in Surrey.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's like a back of the 60s, by the way.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's hard to confirm it on the week show.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Turned out by so smokey as I waited on the corner.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Not watching over the people passing by.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Played up my way too for the girl.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's special.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
She's a girl in life.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's like a giant.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's like a giant.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's like a giant.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's like a giant.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's like a giant.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's like a giant.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's like a giant.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's like a giant.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's like a giant.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's like a giant.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's like a giant.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's like a giant.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's like a giant.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's like a giant.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's like a giant.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's like a giant.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's like a giant.

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's like a giant.

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's like a giant.

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's like a giant.

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's like a giant.

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's like a giant.

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's like a giant.

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's like a giant.

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's like a giant.

44
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's like a giant.

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's like a giant.

46
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's like a giant frog.

47
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's like a giant.

48
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's like a giant.

49
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's like a giant.

50
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's like a giant.

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's like a giant.

52
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's like a giant.

53
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's like a giant.

54
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's like a giant.

55
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's like a giant.

56
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's like a giant.

57
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's like a giant.

58
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's like a giant.

59
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's like a giant.

60
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's like a giant.

61
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's like a giant.

62
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's like a giant.

63
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's like a giant.

64
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's like a giant.

65
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,400
Love that you are smarter than me

66
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,500
I can't love this because I don't speak your language

67
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,600
Love feels it fun, no, what you want to say

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Love feels it fun, no, what you want to say

69
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Love feels it fun, no, what you want to say

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Love feels it fun, no, what you want to say

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Love feels it fun, no, what you want to say

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Love feels it fun, no, what you want to say

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,100
Love feels it fun, no, what you want to say

74
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,900
Love feels it fun, no, what you want to say

75
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,800
Love feels it fun, no, what you want to say

76
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Love feels it fun, no, what you want to say

77
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,600
Love feels it fun, no, what you want to say

78
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,000
Love feels it fun, no, what you want to say

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I've never faced a high cause I don't speak out of my way

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But I feel as if I know what she wants to say

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I've never had the sunshine in her eyes

82
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's run the dawn and I hope that she won't smile at me today

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I've never faced a high cause I don't speak out of my way

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But I feel as if I know what she wants to say

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I've never faced a high cause I don't speak out of my way

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But I feel as if I know what she wants to say

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I've never faced a high cause I don't speak out of my way

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So, actually a very interesting band

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I was a hunting around the Potsay music network

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Actually, I think it's not a band. It's a guy

92
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He'll reach from the buy on the Potsay music network

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The cinnestrels is a project from Steve Dix

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
A British musician residing in Colone, Germany

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Steve's music harks back to the British sound of 1966

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Do I hear it like an echo or something?

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What is that?

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He's got an interesting website

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Interesting story about this guy

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And I heard the song was like yeah, that's kind of like a kinks dedicated

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Follower of fashion type vibe

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'd decide to play it

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I got a lot to do today

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
A lot to talk about

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And as I was putting today's show together

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I had a whole bunch of mini epiphanys

107
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'd have to say, well there we go

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Now it's gone

109
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I think I had something misconfigured

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Sorry about that

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Oh, I know what it is

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's the other headphones we're feeding back

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What do you get when you're doing it all in your own studio

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But still running on cast blasts

115
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Here on the Tashiba portage

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Loving it very much working perfectly

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
We're gonna stick it to the man

118
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
On today's show a couple of promos

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
New announcement of a new show

120
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Join the network

121
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
We've got more pod safe music and a whole album you can download for free

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll talk about that

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I also want to talk about my pod show

124
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And

125
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
If that's not enough

126
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't know what is

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
A lot of people ask me

128
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
How do I prepare for the show?

129
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This is one of the first things that really hit me this morning

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The way I do it actually is throughout the day

131
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Whenever I receive an email that I think is interesting

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Or I want to talk about it

133
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I just want to put in the show

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
If I'm in Gmail I'll tag it with a label with a DSC label

135
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And so it's shuttled off elsewhere

136
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't see it anymore until I need it

137
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If I'm on the blackberry since there's no direct communication

138
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I actually have a way to forward it to my Gmail account

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And through a whole bunch of rules that then shows up in the same DSC folder

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And then what I do basically in the morning is I just start at the bottom

141
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And work my way up towards the top

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And I realize that

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Well over 70% of this show is put together by the people that listen to it

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And it makes so much sense

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You know this is

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay, so let me just follow on that for a second

147
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This is a tremendous opportunity

148
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Remember when when we were talking about mashups and how they were put together

149
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And the problems with mashups the rights issues problems

150
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You can't really even create a mashup and sell it on a CD

151
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Because you know a mashup often consists of so many different songs

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That it's almost impossible to clear all the rights to it

153
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Now that's not a technological problem

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That is my gosh when songs are played on the radio

155
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
There are actual computers that are registering that sound

156
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And it's called BDS and what it does is it takes off the number of airplay

157
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So that basically the whole music industry

158
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Which includes the broadcast industry knows which songs have been played

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
How many times at any given moment

160
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So the technology is there it's just the licensing has been difficult

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But now I'm podcasting now that we're in this digital realm

162
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm thinking you know there's there's an opportunity here

163
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
To create identifier

164
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So basically if you sent in an audio comment or if I played one of your songs

165
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You know pod save music network

166
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Then you would automatically be notified that your audio or your video

167
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Even for that for that matter had been traced to this

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You know let's just call my podcast a mashup for a moment

169
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
To this mashup and it would be you know identified

170
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And this is something a lot of musicians ask me about who upload their tracks

171
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The pod save music network they say well if someone uses it as a promo

172
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
How can I be accredited for it?

173
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And of course you know I'm sure pod castle will put that on their show side

174
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Or you know the put some permanent link

175
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But you know it is of course not you don't get credit every single time

176
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That someone plays a promo particularly not if other pod castes are playing

177
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You kind of get my drift right?

178
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So this is one of the things that

179
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
George's Russian scientist is working on and I'm very excited about about the really the endless possibilities of this again

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't think it's tremendous science although there is definitely some science in it to get it done

181
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But I think the technology is there to make it all work

182
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Excuse me

183
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yep, I have a fresh cup of it right here

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
George's mom listens by the way too

185
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
She's I think his whole family a Russian scientist living up in Canada

186
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Hey George is mom glad you tuned it in

187
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,000

228
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Thank you for inviting shrink wrap radio into the pod show family

229
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm a regular DSC listener and I'm definitely on board with all the big dreams that you and Ron are bringing into reality

230
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
shrink wrap radio features interviews with interesting people in and around the broad world of psychology

231
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The format is a weekly show that runs around a half hour in length

232
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Ending with a piece of pod safe music that ties into the week's topic in our first 20 shows

233
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
We have covered such topics as the meaning of dreams psychedelics developing intuition Islamic psychology

234
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Consumer research

235
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Gestalt therapy

236
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Buddhist meditation mythology

237
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And we've even touched on the inner workings of the infamous zodiac serial killer

238
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We've got a lot more interesting topics planned who knows?

239
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
We might even get into the psychology of the trans oceanic metro sexual

240
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Free wrap radio is must listening for anyone interested in what makes us tick

241
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:42,000
This is the show that brings you all the psychology you need to know and just enough to make you a little bit dangerous

242
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So Adam thanks again for bringing shrink wrap radio into pod show

243
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
This is Dr. Dave saying it's all in your mind

244
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah, no kidding back

245
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And I like these types of shows

246
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Just like the skinny on sports you know fastest ten minutes on your iPod

247
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
This is like just no enough to be dangerous, you know, so you can be a cool guy at that cocktail partay

248
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Welcome Dr. Dave great to have you on board. Welcome to the pod show podcast network fantastic

249
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Um, and as you heard Dr. Dave could be our guy. He could be the guy that would actually help us out in our metro sexual moments

250
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Metro sexual

251
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Metro sexual

252
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Metro sexual

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Metro sexual

254
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's Adam Curry's Metro sexual moment

255
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And Curry's Metro sexual moment

256
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yes, indeed. It is time for the Metro sexual moment

257
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Try to move it up a little bit in the formatting of the show

258
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So that we can have our friends on the serious stars one or three

259
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Participating all the joy

260
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Adam says John Dwyer in regards to the Metro sexual moment from DSC 321

261
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
There was a question about moisturizers and acne. My dermatologist highly recommends moisturizing every day

262
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
This helps reduce the overproduction of oils in the skin that cause acne

263
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The key to this is getting a moisturizer that's oil-free. There are many brands available all at any surprise

264
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I use Johnson of Johnson's purpose. It's oil-free fragrance-free high-poilogenic and contains SPF-15 sunblock

265
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This way you get all the benefit but no girly smell

266
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
For you or UK listeners when I lived in England I used a moisturizer from Nutrigina that I got at boots that did the same thing

267
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
If you're wondering what the hell this is all about

268
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The Metro sexual moment is where us guys huddle around and just kind of talk about stuff that we normally

269
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Wouldn't feel comfortable talking about in the locker room or around the water cooler, you know, but it's a and by the way

270
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
To Chris Rockwell dude, I'm not taking away the man out of us. It's important stuff

271
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Become a little bit more Metro sexual my friend

272
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And you might actually get laid

273
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Bob Brown says hey Adam first off damn you

274
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Due to your constants and sale references I went out last week and bought one

275
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I have to say for the most part systems great simpler than making regular coffee and faster than making instant coffee

276
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And then it goes on to complain about pods, there's a Germany

277
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But what it be prudent he says to add to the Metro sexual moment is and say oh minute or something

278
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'd love to get advice as to what I could drink

279
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And it could in turn beef up sales of particular coffee product

280
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
God knows I had that sales since I opened my air for six months

281
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm sure the promoting your coffee pot would be just as effective

282
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Okay, well you mean so like what to drink and how to be swive and what to serve

283
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Is that is that what you're talking about?

284
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yeah, I'm okay with that

285
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Send me some stuff audio comments by the way what I really need to the Metro sexual moments

286
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Little tired of just reading a G-mails

287
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Back to our shaving topic

288
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Shoot, I don't have the name of the person who sent this to me

289
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But Gillette has a new razor that will likely replace the mock three five blades instead of three

290
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Also available in a powered version

291
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Excellent

292
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Well, we will try it out of course and I'm still working towards

293
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You know trying to talk to the Gillette people see we can get every registered listener of the

294
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Daily source code at least he wants one a a mock three or who knows maybe a mock five power razor

295
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'll talk about registered listenership and a bit and then finally Kevin Shelombog Adam

296
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I was listening to DSC today while walking along Michigan Avenue in Chicago

297
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Oh man there's show reaches doesn't it

298
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
During the Metro sexual moment right about the time you said something about women digging a well groomed man

299
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
A gorgeous woman walked up next to me at the stop light

300
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I could not help but take a look

301
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
She was absolutely beautiful with long blonde hair and sexy high heel leather boots

302
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
What's more?

303
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
She glanced back at me almost with a giggle

304
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Just then I realized I'd been humming the Metro sexual theme song

305
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Well, was there any continuation to the story my friend?

306
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Inquiring minds need to know

307
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Quick update on developments back at Pod Show HQ

308
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I know I have my extra long days now that I'm in the cottage where I can do everything I need to do

309
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Until about four o'clock. That's one San Francisco wakes up

310
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And then we continue until about 11 or 12 o'clock. It's double duty

311
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But I somehow I really am I get to stay on top of things

312
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And I get to listen to so much more during the day undisturbed. It's lovely

313
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I got an email from Rockstar Kevin

314
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:45,000
He really has a lot of the lead development on the what we're actually what we're calling my pod show because you know

315
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Besides creating the pod cast delivery network for the pod casters

316
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Which and with that comes a shitload there's you know show sites and all kinds of modules

317
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You can put on it with the you know the last top the last just an example

318
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Last five song pod safe music songs you played from the network

319
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's very simple system cast blaster integrates into a beautifully

320
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
He sent me because basically I think the beta is starting is starting getting ready to roll

321
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And it's out of my hands you know yesterday of Brian from operations

322
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Sent out an email is like okay we're moving people and I think a girl a guy in the bottle of the first ones

323
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That are going to be migrated onto the podcast delivery network

324
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So when you think about you know just some of those modules I'm talking about it

325
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Makes a lot of sense to give listeners a lot and you access to a lot of that to and by the way

326
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Is there difference between a listener and a pod cast or maybe not in many many cases

327
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And I'm so excited about what actually so I want to say you know

328
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The whole team but definitely wanted to sing about Kevin for a second because in the past couple of months

329
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
He's just

330
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
He's gone to kind of a and I've talked to him about this personally

331
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So I don't feel like I'm revealing anything by saying it but he went kind of from an introverted guy into just a superstar

332
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
He'd like like a switch went on

333
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And he's you know now he's he's managing all these other developers and just this shit is really coming together

334
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And it's very very exciting and I think we get our maybe I guess we get our logins today or whatever

335
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So I'm just you know it's just an excitement thing for me

336
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And you know that means that a lot of these podcasts that are joining the network

337
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You've been hearing announced on the daily source code

338
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
They'll also have access to that portion

339
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So you know as we grow we're going to grow this beta and then of course the point at the end of the day is that everyone can come in and use it

340
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So but we're just taking it safe and rather get some you get some stuff out now and let it break and work on it and continue because

341
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Like almost like the pod safe music network sales system which I'll talk about later as well

342
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You know we're not building a store we're adding functionality and we're doing it as a part of the unlabel concept

343
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
If we just want to go and recreate a store then you know why don't we just put pod safe iTunes on the front door

344
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You know I don't think that's what we want to do anyway excited

345
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And I got the tickets for Christina's show

346
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I think I mentioned that she wanted tickets to go to panic at the disco

347
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Which is essentially an independent band that just recently got signed and they're really catching some fire

348
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's pretty good band and so she found two tickets on eBay

349
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You know the sales prices like 20 pounds

350
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I think she wound up buying them for 60 pounds

351
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Fucking scouting what a scam that is

352
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm so not used to it because you know always used to get free tickets or backstage passes or whatever to get to almost any show

353
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And I probably could still do that if I wanted to

354
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But you know you forget how you know what an industry has been built up around all that

355
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Including people who buy tons of tickets and then auction them off for three times the price on eBay

356
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You know it's just the way it works in fact make no mistake

357
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I know many many artists

358
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Who as a part of their contract with any venue will demand a certain you know blocks of seats

359
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And they literally turn around and sell them off to scalpers

360
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's and usually the artists themselves don't do it, but their managers do famously accused of this was

361
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Ah, was it Arnold?

362
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I want to say this is a fool or was that the pig on green acres?

363
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Uh, Rod Stewart's manager was accused of this in New York

364
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I don't know if he was actually convicted but

365
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So I don't want to say that it's true for a fact

366
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
But trust me when I say there's a lot of money going around in that business

367
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
A sheet load

368
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Let me see, I think I've time to do this before the satellite window closed

369
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
The creepy sleeping show podcast

370
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Intensive music

371
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Inturn to the parts of us

372
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And now a message from the president of the United States George W.

373
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Good morning

374
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
This week members of a House and Senate Conference Committee

375
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The police and agreement on reauthorization of the Patriot

376
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Art of victory is able to

377
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
The Patriot acts tougher criminal penalties and increased resources to come back

378
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
The dangerous spread of facilities

379
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Creepy sleeping

380
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Judge Carl

381
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I wanted to mention that

382
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Although I've said it before and I will say it again for a few more weeks

383
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
We're very happy to have a review sponsoring a podcast

384
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Heather and John L.

385
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
This is an exciting development in advertising in podcasting

386
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Where you have a company that understands what its audience is

387
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Basically supporting its audience

388
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Of course in exchange for

389
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
For getting young girls to switch on to active use

390
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I like the product myself. I've used it ever since I've had contact lenses

391
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
But the show is pretty cool

392
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's Heather and John L

393
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
What is a tagline here

394
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I think it's like two girls

395
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Let me see

396
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm actually looking at the banner for a second on the site

397
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Two friends get a microphone

398
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Will they get an audience?

399
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
There you go download.acuview.com

400
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Those of you listening to this on the series stars

401
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
103

402
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Thanks for listening

403
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
We'll be back tomorrow

404
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Pacific Coast Hellways up next for you

405
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
If you want to hear the rest of what we talk about here in podcast land

406
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You gotta go download it

407
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I

408
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Actually got an email from Mark Szeeda

409
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Hey Adam just wanted to give you a comment about your sound

410
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Or to win your satellite window closes

411
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And yes, it's kind of related to sound

412
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Virtising

413
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Apparently it's a TV show in Australia called

414
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Rove Live

415
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's a Letterman type variety show. He has a segment called

416
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
What the

417
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I guess isn't what the fuck

418
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Where people send in pictures of funny signs

419
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Newspaper ads and stuff like that

420
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
They don't make sense or give a different meaning

421
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
To what it's meant to me and you understand

422
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's like headlines so I'll jail and I'll call it

423
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
He uses the same musical signature to introduce his segment

424
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And as a regular viewer of the show

425
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'm accustomed to hearing the sound and associating it with

426
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
What the?

427
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So every time you announce that your satellite window is closing

428
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You play that sound like get the natural reaction of saying what the

429
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Interesting

430
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
That stuff works man

431
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It really does

432
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And you just can't deprogram people profit

433
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Which is the beautiful thing of the Vulcan mind trick

434
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It came standard with and that is kind of interesting

435
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It came standard with this application called Countdown Clock

436
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Which I think I have another 20 days to use before

437
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm going to I'm probably going to buy it

438
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It works well

439
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I like it. It's very simple. It does everything I wanted to

440
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And so the question is

441
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Is the sound

442
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Clear or the rights cleared or is the guy

443
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Is Rove Live using the sound of the countdown timer

444
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
All these questions and more will not be answered

445
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Oh

446
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
What was that?

447
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
That's weird

448
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
This is the first time I've seen this happen with cast blaster

449
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
What is that?

450
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Well, maybe this is just a cropped sound file

451
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Hold on

452
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Oh, that's not right

453
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Let me try another one

454
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
That works

455
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I do want to play that jMac thing

456
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Hold on, let me just open it up then

457
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Try a media player

458
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Oops, so that would be today

459
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Oh, man

460
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Okay, so this is where windows breaks down for me

461
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Find it so difficult to navigate through the file structure

462
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Here we go. I mean the folder I want

463
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Where is

464
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Oh, man

465
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Tell us this

466
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Oh, here it is

467
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
JMac. Okay. This is going to come through on the other sound

468
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Mr. Curley to jMac

469
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Out of light dot com

470
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I wanted to say thank you very much for playing that promo for us

471
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
We got a lot of great feedback

472
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And sort of the artist megatron

473
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
He's pretty excited about that

474
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
We put a lot of hard work into it

475
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So it came out really good and we're really excited about it

476
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And megatron wanted me to say thank you very much

477
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
for sending that off to your buddies over a series

478
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
So he's really geeked about that

479
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Another thing I wanted to talk to you about was

480
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
The pot safe music network

481
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
We're really really excited about the pot safe music network

482
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Being able to sell artists tracks

483
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Because a lot of artists we work with will be really excited about that

484
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
They'll be able to make money off of people here in the music

485
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
But however it's hard for us to keep up with the latest and greatest

486
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
That you guys have had submitted to you

487
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
By artists so it's hard for us to keep up on the latest tracks

488
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And being a producer I never realized how much work it is

489
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I'm sure you already familiar with it

490
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
With all your experience in the in the radio business

491
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
But I didn't know it's so busy

492
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I mean I'm constantly busy

493
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm constantly doing things research and looking things up

494
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So it's really hard for me to keep up with new submissions

495
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
On the pot safe music network

496
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And get them over to our reviewers to check out

497
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
To be put on the show

498
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So here's the deal

499
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
My idea is to maybe place an RSS feed

500
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
For each genre of music

501
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So that we can add and remove whatever genres we would be interested in

502
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
To our feed readers

503
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
That way we can stay up on the latest and greatest tracks

504
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
That have been submitted to the pot safe music network

505
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And maybe in that feed you can supply a link

506
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Rate to that artists pot safe music page

507
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Now I think that could be done with relatively little effort

508
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
On your guys' sights since you guys have some world-class developers over there

509
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So I think it would be a great thing

510
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I think it would be really great for me and other podcasts too

511
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So we don't have to go search in a mile all the time

512
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It's conveniently there if we need it the RSS is there

513
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I'm sorry there I apologize

514
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I guess I haven't done my homework and it's hidden in the site somewhere

515
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And I didn't see it

516
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Otherwise thanks

517
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And I look forward to hear your feedback on this

518
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Thanks for taking the time

519
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I'll be in touch

520
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Thank you

521
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Well the good news is this whole site is completely RSSified from the ground up

522
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So actually let me just check for a second if you go to

523
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I'll check for you

524
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm pretty sure it's what you're asking for is not there

525
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
But I know it's very easy to do

526
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
So I'm looking at the new submissions

527
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
No

528
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Okay

529
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Doesn't I don't think that'll be a problem

530
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
As you know there's an RSS link for your most recent

531
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Shows played there's an RSS feed for

532
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I think the top 10 songs

533
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
So I think it would be relatively simple to create an RSS feed

534
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
For new submissions and do it by category

535
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And I'll ask Chris Rockwell if you can if you can put that in

536
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It may have to wait

537
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You know a week or two before we can implement that

538
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Because it got like Jersey Joe

539
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And I think Dan going over all the code

540
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And we're tightening everything up again

541
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
We're about to do credit card transactions

542
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And we definitely found a couple things that we wanted

543
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Different done differently

544
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
So I apologize it jumped a gun a little bit

545
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Although I have made the purchase

546
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I have made actually a purchase pod say for peace

547
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
You know we brought slowing to the mix

548
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Just for testing purposes

549
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And it works fantastically

550
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And again we'll talk about pricing in a second

551
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
But a lot of second I'm rolling one up here

552
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Remember this is just us podcasts is not on the satellite

553
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
You know I can do whatever I want to do

554
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Yeah, let's definitely get that going

555
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
That's a very good idea

556
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And it would be I mean obviously what we can do is we can do

557
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
An RSS feed within closures

558
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Because then you know at least not

559
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
No that doesn't I mean that's just not a good idea

560
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I don't think that

561
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Well maybe it is a good idea

562
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Hmm

563
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It's just you know because it's such an open honor system

564
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Where you know you can download all this stuff if you're a podcaster

565
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And by the way with the system I was talking about Russian

566
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Russian George scientist George

567
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
You know we'll be able to keep a little bit better eye on that as well

568
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
If we see that you're only downloading and it never reappears

569
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And a mash or something that you know you can put back into the network

570
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Then you're not contributing and you know the way you should be

571
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You can't just all be taken not give

572
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Oh man I can see this so clearly

573
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I can really see it happening

574
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And it's going to go beyond audio for sure

575
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
For damn sure

576
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Lots of comments about the sound quality of the show

577
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And I had some thought about that as well

578
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
There are

579
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You know since I started using cast blaster

580
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I think that

581
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
There's a difference in MP3 encoders

582
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I used to use the lame libraries

583
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Which I think are probably the best

584
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
But it really adds a whole extra step to the show

585
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
So I didn't feel like doing that every single time

586
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
But I basically reencode

587
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Either I'd make an AIFF

588
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Of my show on the Mac

589
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'd do it with

590
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Audio hijack pro

591
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And then I'd encode that to MP3 with the lame

592
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And I had some custom settings

593
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And it was really really good

594
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
But it's just too much of a hassle

595
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Now I'm using cast blaster

596
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I think cast blaster uses the windows media player

597
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Codec to create the MP3 files

598
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I'm not too sure about that

599
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Since Mike did the whole re-writing

600
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
By the way

601
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I think he just released another re-writing

602
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
The problem that you just witnessed

603
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And I'm using beta 51

604
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Is now gone

605
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And there's some other little buggies that are gone

606
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
So I just haven't had the time

607
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Yet to back up my files and switch to

608
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
To the new version

609
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
But I'm sure it's working well

610
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Along those lines

611
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
This is interesting from Finland

612
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Verve

613
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Victor India

614
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Victor India Romeo Victor Echo

615
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Greetings from Finland

616
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
From Finland Adam and listen to your show

617
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Since last summer

618
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I've been somewhat addicted to it

619
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I'm not a Mac user

620
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Don't have an iPod

621
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
But I've enjoyed the world of podcasting

622
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
With my creatives and micro

623
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
This is what we're talking about yesterday

624
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
You don't even need the portable player

625
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
You can just listen to it on the

626
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
You know through the website

627
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
DailySourceCode.com

628
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
So I bought that in August

629
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I've been very happy with it

630
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And I, of course

631
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I have to use Windows MediaPlayer

632
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
To put my MP3s into it

633
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
After downloading them to iTunes

634
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Yeah

635
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
That's a pain in the ass

636
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
But now I have a problem

637
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Since you started using Cast Blast

638
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I haven't been able to transfer

639
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
The DailySourceCode files to my Zen micro

640
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
With the Windows MediaPlayer

641
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I get an error message reading

642
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Quote invalid access to memory location

643
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And then the MediaPlayer just crashes

644
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
This is strange because all the other podcast

645
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Transfers with no problem

646
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Including the earlier episodes of DSC

647
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
For instance, 316 works

648
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I did some testing

649
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Open322 audacity

650
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And saved it to MP3 again

651
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And I worked fine

652
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So I'm thinking the problem could be in publishing

653
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Or in the ID3 tags

654
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I don't know

655
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I'm a girl

656
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It's too technical

657
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
The hell is that

658
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I know lots of girls who are very technical

659
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But it's cute anyway

660
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
This does sound like a problem

661
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And I wonder if it's a problem on the encoding side

662
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Well

663
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
That wouldn't make sense

664
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
If what I just said is true

665
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
That Cast Blaster uses the Windows MediaPlayer in Coder

666
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Then I should make any difference

667
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So I guess I'll have to hop into the Cast Blaster form

668
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And find out what that is

669
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Ver if I'm sorry about that

670
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
We'll work on it

671
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
We'll figure it out one way

672
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
The other that is pretty critical

673
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
That it works on Windows MediaPlayer

674
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Here's a question from Mike from West Fargo

675
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
North Dakota

676
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Oh, this is about making videos

677
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
He says he's a little bit behind on his

678
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
See, listening to the conversation we had earlier

679
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
He'd like to make videos for Podsafe

680
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Music songs

681
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Is any way I can do this and report back

682
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Mike, yeah

683
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I think this is exactly what we're working on

684
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Where it will be automatic

685
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And this is going to be a part of the unlabel

686
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
It makes so much sense for

687
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
You to create a music video

688
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And then help the artist sell

689
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Some music

690
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I thought somewhere I had a question about

691
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Podsafe

692
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Music network

693
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
What was that

694
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Shoot, you know what?

695
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I think that's I probably saved that for tomorrow's show

696
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
About the pricing

697
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Well, there was one thing I wanted to say

698
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
When we do put the unlabel pieces in place

699
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Of course

700
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
If you help sell

701
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
A song by the artist

702
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
But you don't want to take any commission

703
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Of course, we will enable it so you can give that to the artist

704
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
That's just the one thing

705
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
And I think we will bump into this again tomorrow

706
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
When I play that, when I play that audio comment

707
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
But that's a given

708
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I just want to make sure

709
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And again, as we roll out testing

710
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
We don't want anything

711
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Let's just get this thing rolling

712
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Let's get it all working

713
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Before we even talk about what Penny's pod show

714
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Would like to have

715
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Um, okay

716
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
This is very fun

717
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm so excited about this

718
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Hi Adam

719
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
My name is Mark

720
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And I'm from a small town in New Hampshire called Cornish

721
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And yes, it's named after the town of Cornish in England

722
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I've been listening to your podcast for quite a while now

723
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I just finished listening to DSE32

724
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And I'm sorry to hear that you had to go out and buy a windows computer

725
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
In order to solve the audio looping problem

726
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I even more sorry to tell you that I have a windows computer

727
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I've always had windows computers

728
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And I've experienced the audio looping problem numerous times

729
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
When playing back audio files, especially MP3 files

730
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
In Windows Media Player

731
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
And my favorite player called BS player

732
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
When playing back recordings that I made in audacity

733
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Which is what I'm using to record this comment

734
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Hopefully this is just a quirk of my system

735
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And you'll never experience it with your brand new to Shiba

736
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Anyway, I just want to let you know that it may not be that easy

737
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
To get away from the looping problem

738
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And that I think what you're doing with the pod show

739
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And the pod safe music network is really great

740
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
How do I become a registered listener by the way?

741
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Thanks Adam, take care

742
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Right, so that's going to happen through my pod show

743
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And it's going to be a really cool interface for listeners

744
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
To keep track of their shows, to share the shows, to share episodes

745
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
That they like to connect with other listeners

746
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And to get free shit, I hope

747
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
If you're registered to listen to this show, that's what I'm going to do

748
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I'm going to try and get you free shit

749
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
So about the looping thing, I don't think

750
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
These problems are related

751
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
In fact, yesterday and I posted this at curry.com

752
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
A new site was brought to my attention called

753
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
PowerBookDefect.Info

754
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
PowerBookDefect.Info

755
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I'll just read a little bit from the site

756
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
We are power book owners that are experiencing a sound defect

757
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
In the latest PowerBook G4, the problem occurs on the high resolution

758
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Models 15 and 17 inches

759
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Update, also on the 12 inch

760
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And probably on all the new PowerBooks being sold in shops today

761
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
A lot of people says that the say

762
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Oh, this is interesting, a lot of people says

763
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
That the echo slash loop problem disappears

764
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
If you use an external sound card instead of the internal one

765
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
This insulates that all new PowerBooks have some sort of damage

766
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
On the internal sound card that provoked this error to happen

767
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
This of course is exactly the problem you've heard here on the daily source code

768
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So far Apple's official statement is

769
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
No multitasking, only use one sound app at a time

770
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And this is a lesson for me as well

771
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
You know, this is like

772
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You can't do this as a big company

773
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
You know, with such dedicated followers

774
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Look, I got wronged by my partner

775
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
By 17 inch, the new G4

776
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
He's got all kinds of audio shit and he bought logic

777
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And he's got a different problem

778
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Where logic just overloads it overloads the CPU

779
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
When you use like three tracks or some MIDI tracks

780
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
It's just fucking crazy

781
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
It's something's wrong with these machines

782
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I can feel it, you know

783
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And it seems like tens of thousands of people are having this problem

784
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And all Apple really has to say at this point

785
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You know, hey, we take you seriously, we're working on it

786
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I'll be good for another three months if you tell me that

787
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
No problem at all

788
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
But just tell me, don't tell me that

789
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
You know, this is a problem we'll update you

790
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And in the meantime, I'm only used one sound application

791
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
What do you think we use these things for?

792
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
We use them for sound applications

793
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I've been the biggest promoter of this platform

794
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Guy, yeah, yeah, yeah

795
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So powerbook defect.info, okay

796
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
It's still going to demand

797
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Taking the lawn to our own hands

798
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Something like that

799
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Let me see, I'm not going to do this next

800
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Let me just see

801
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Shoot man, yeah

802
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
These shows are getting too long

803
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
There's too much for me to say

804
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm just skip this next bit

805
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I'll move that over to tomorrow

806
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Hold on, we're going to do Trinity tomorrow as well

807
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I think

808
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
You know what?

809
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I'm going to skip all the rest

810
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I'm going to leave that all for tomorrow

811
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
So we have some other things to talk about

812
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Except for the financial aid podcast

813
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I was, he's got, oh, he's always has some good stuff to say

814
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So check this out

815
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
This is Chris from the financial aid podcast

816
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Here to talk to you about money

817
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Specifically the money from the pot safe music network

818
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Music store

819
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Maybe the pot safe music store, I guess

820
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Regarding what I as a podcast

821
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
It would be looking for in terms of revenue from

822
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
What you call the splits

823
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Not a whole lot

824
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Because I'm already getting the music for free

825
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I'm getting the license to play for free

826
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
It's really very generous

827
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Of the artists to share that

828
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
To be willing to take the risk of that

829
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
A podcast doesn't go just fling it up

830
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
On one of the peer-to-peer networks

831
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And completely undermine the AD artist's efforts

832
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So I would say at most

833
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Maybe a penny

834
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Or another idea which I'd be hugely in favor of

835
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Would be credit

836
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
A song credit

837
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So for example

838
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Let's say I refer 80 people to play

839
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
To a buy a drive away by Matthew evil

840
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Hey Matthew, that's a plug for you

841
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
In return for that I would get maybe 80 credits

842
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
That I could use towards

843
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I could give them out to friends

844
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I could say, hey, why don't you pick up

845
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
A free song on the podcast

846
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Music network courtesy of the financial aid podcast

847
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Here's a free credit

848
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Or you know, it wouldn't have to be one one

849
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
It could be 10 to one

850
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
10 credits

851
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Give away one song

852
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Something so that people who are not

853
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Not, you know, not podcasts

854
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Just can get a piece of free music

855
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
That is unencumbered and unrestrict

856
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Anyway

857
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Just an idea from the financial aid podcast

858
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It's financial aid podcast.com

859
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
See you around

860
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Yo dude

861
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
See I knew I was right

862
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And actually I was better prepared

863
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Than I thought I was

864
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
This is what I should have played when I was talking about

865
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
The pricing thing

866
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
This is the comment

867
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
From that I thought was going to be played tomorrow

868
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
So I'm sorry about that

869
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Absolutely

870
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And I love that thinking

871
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I love the idea of the credits

872
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And you can give credits away

873
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Fantastic

874
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And we should be that flexible

875
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
At the unlabel

876
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
To be able to make those choices

877
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Like that very much

878
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
We'll definitely work on that

879
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Finally then

880
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I got one more piece of music

881
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I want to share with you

882
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And the reason why is because of this email

883
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
A reodrebica

884
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Says

885
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Adam I manage the San Diego band Bill

886
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
You played their song

887
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Sound Scientist

888
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
A while back just wanted to drop

889
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
You line about a promotion

890
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
That we are doing this week

891
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
This is cool

892
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
As a bit of a thank you to the podcast community

893
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
We have made Bill's new album

894
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Birthday Suit available for free

895
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Download for this week

896
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
We spent over six months on the

897
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
In the recording studio

898
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And we put everything we've got into it

899
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Really look for people to hear the music

900
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
We thought this would be a good way to accomplish it

901
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Being played on your show and the pass gave us a big swell

902
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
In listeners in the past

903
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
We're hoping the same might be true for getting the album out there

904
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
If you think your audience would be interested

905
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Please let them know that the album is available

906
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000

Bill's music.net slash podcast playback

911
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Dude

912
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I love this

913
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Man and you know what?

914
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I think this is so smart

915
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I really really do

916
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And I downloaded the album

917
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I've loaded it into my iPod

918
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Love it it's all kind of the same vibe

919
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
As a sound scientist

920
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
And well obviously

921
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I want to play

922
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I already had a copy of course

923
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Since I played it on the show

924
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
But this one's from your download

925
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
This is Bill

926
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I'm the source code

927
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
On a girl's case

928
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Highly classified confidential

929
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Interface against the guy

930
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
You look like you could use a brick

931
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Said as I lived in my head

932
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And I'm a working from a dead tree

933
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Not sure how long I was on foot

934
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Looking for the cloth on a star

935
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
On the show when I look together

936
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Thought I had been mistaken

937
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Lookin' in the wrong direction

938
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And I can question David

939
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Just do the answer

940
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Again a chance

941
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Cause when I hit the wall

942
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Just come to the back

943
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
And send me up for the ball

944
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Love a lab test

945
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
And some men too go

946
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I love a lab test

947
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Mix it up, mix it up

948
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Stir it in a cup

949
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And turn it into

950
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Mix it open to the double tree

951
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Step on the glass

952
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
And we're catching on here

953
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You better act now

954
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And I'll think you might have lots of you

955
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
A trick, trick, trick, trick, trick

956
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
See the wind's all the medicine

957
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Baby, little something

958
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Take the edge of while you wait and don't come

959
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
But I'm out of blood

960
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
It's kickin' hooked on us

961
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Hopin' up your hands

962
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Let me get you into

963
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I'll just stop

964
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
We're just somewhere

965
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
To go

966
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And I know

967
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I've got this day

968
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Yeah

969
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
In search of the truth

970
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I lost

971
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
For ever better stay

972
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I've got this day

973
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
