1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
For the first time ever, the Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. in one action-packed DVD collection,

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,000
own all 27 episodes, the cult hit, including all new interviews with Carlton Koo.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,560
First thing that Brisco did that impressed us was, we're not only to come in and really read the dialogue well as an actor,

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,720
but he also did a standing flip in our office.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,640
You flipped too for Brisco County!

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,360
If you like the kind of TV you can't get on TV, get your copy of the Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,360
Available now on DVD!

8
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:16,360
You'll just do show 475 and you'll come back at 500 and give me what's in your pipe.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
A $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,480
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

11
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,480
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

12
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:49,480
I'm casting his family curry.

13
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,480
Kids today don't pay no attention.

14
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,480
They're bouncing right off the walls.

15
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:07,480
They're supposed to be still, they're supposed to have fear, that's supposed to be all.

16
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,480
And all the children can't seem to focus.

17
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,480
They're acting out of their minds.

18
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:24,480
They've been running up a tape and stirring it up, they've been crossing the mind.

19
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:32,480
We found this thing that comes and comes and we've got enough to go away.

20
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,480
We've got enough to go away.

21
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,480
We've got to do it now.

22
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:49,480
Let's put them all on the riddle.

23
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:56,480
The children need discipline now.

24
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:04,480
Before we land this awful condition, they call it being a child.

25
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,480
I guess they couldn't tell that the kids weren't well.

26
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,480
They let them run wild.

27
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,480
The kids won't mind taking their schools.

28
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,480
They've got it all in their lives.

29
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,480
If they start feeling blue, they get stuff to let you.

30
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,480
It's worth it, we've got enough to go away.

31
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:39,480
We found the thing that comes and we've got enough to go away.

32
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:49,480
We've got enough to go away.

33
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:57,480
Let's put them all on the riddle.

34
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,480
Let's put them all on the riddle.

35
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,480
The children need discipline now.

36
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:15,480
We've got enough to go away.

37
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,480
We've got enough to go away.

38
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:28,480
We've got enough to go away.

39
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,480
We've got enough to go away.

40
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,480
We've got enough to go away.

41
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,480
We've got enough to go away.

42
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:51,480
We've got enough to go away.

43
00:04:51,480 --> 00:05:00,480
We've got enough to go away.

44
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:19,480
We've got enough to go away.

45
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:26,480
You've got to feel free to sing along if you're there.

46
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,680
phonics, riddle in, different Tennessee.

47
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,840
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

48
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,120
Welcome to the Daily Source Code episode number

49
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,880
four, seven, five.

50
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,480
Once again in the Curricondo in lovely Northern California.

51
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,920
San Francisco to be exact.

52
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,280
Hey, it is really dark outside at the moment.

53
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,920
I'd forgotten that even in Autumn and Winter,

54
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,760
it even gets a little dark in San Francisco,

55
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,600
at least it doesn't get light as early.

56
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,000
Just past six AM hour and we are rocking to go

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,360
in other two weeks here in partially in San Francisco,

58
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,360
at HQ and I think we're going to go to Los Angeles

59
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,960
and New York for sure and sometime next week.

60
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,280
And all right, I might as well come out and say it.

61
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,240
I mean, we were talking about,

62
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,040
yeah, the so we played the song, Riddle in there.

63
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,960
I think that we may have up the dosage,

64
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,160
a little bit too much for some of the Pachio kids at HQ.

65
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,880
I woke up this morning and guess what?

66
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,880
It appears that somebody did not reregister podshow.com.

67
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,240
I might as well just cop to it right now

68
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,680
because I know what's going to happen for the next week.

69
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,280
It's going to be nothing but headlines.

70
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,280
I'll write the headline for you, okay?

71
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,880
Bloggers, you ready?

72
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,360
Whoa, unbelievable, a company that raises almost $25 million.

73
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,280
Can't even register their own domain name.

74
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,360
Go ahead, go ahead and do it.

75
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,840
I'm just going to presume that's exactly what happened.

76
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,600
And however stupid it is, it did happen.

77
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,080
Luckily, we've got a really good relationship with GoDaddy.

78
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,920
So I'm sure we'll be able to get, hopefully,

79
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,760
by the time you're listening to this has been fixed,

80
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,200
but it's just unbelievable.

81
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,560
A stupid can we get?

82
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,800
Ah, this is not the way to wake up.

83
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,000
I really, really hate, if you're listening to serious stars

84
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,960
102, you're thinking the fuck as he talking about.

85
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,320
And didn't this happen with Yahoo at one point?

86
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,200
Or I think it happened with Microsoft,

87
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,920
but it's so unnecessary and so stupid.

88
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,840
And then all of a sudden your domain name gets parked.

89
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,680
And then all your email doesn't arrive.

90
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,480
And people can't get a podshow.com as,

91
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,360
oh, it's so incredibly lame.

92
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,840
I just feel so dumb.

93
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,920
I'll take full responsibility for it.

94
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,280
So yesterday afternoon arrived in SFO,

95
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,880
and I had made a very conscious decision upon leaving.

96
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,840
I had said, I even said to Patricia, I said,

97
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,160
look, I'm so tired of carrying around this studio.

98
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,920
And I don't mind taking the microphone and stuff,

99
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,160
but just unplugging everything.

100
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,760
There's every piece of equipment has its own power cord,

101
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,680
which, of course, needs a U.S. power cord,

102
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,600
or it needs an adapter, and then the adapters

103
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,960
and strong enough, we've been through that before.

104
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,600
And it's just a whole bunch of wires,

105
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,120
and it weighs a frickin' ton.

106
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,480
So I decided to force myself

107
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,880
into finally setting up a full blown studio here

108
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,320
at the condo, by not taking anything.

109
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,600
The only thing I took, of course, was the high LPR 40,

110
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,480
and as we got in around, was I set the condo yesterday

111
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,360
around two in the afternoon.

112
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,000
And like, okay, I'm gonna set out,

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,800
and I'm gonna go get some stuff.

114
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,560
Now, I went down to the garage,

115
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,360
and I was gonna fire up Trinity,

116
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,360
which she fires up fine, but there's a flat left rear tire.

117
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,680
Yeah, it just goes from bad to worse here.

118
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,320
So the rear tire was flat,

119
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,720
so I couldn't go to guitar world.

120
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,120
So I figured out what the F,

121
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,240
I'm gonna walk around, see if I can find anything.

122
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,680
Now you have to know where the condo is situated,

123
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,520
which is south of market, but it's very much,

124
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,280
it's right near the Bay Bridge.

125
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,920
It's kind of in the twilight zone.

126
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,120
There's three or four blocks of nothing whatsoever.

127
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,400
But I figured this is San Francisco,

128
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,360
this is a music town, I should be able to find something.

129
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,200
So I set off, and finally,

130
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,840
it was a third, and

131
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,160
dot Harrison, a little bit further down,

132
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,600
but on third, actually the address is 493, 3rd Street.

133
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,480
I see this really funky small store,

134
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,920
called Black Market Music,

135
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,960
and it's owned by Rock and Rick.

136
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,160
And so I walk in and the proprietor,

137
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,360
Rock and Rick immediately says,

138
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,880
hey, Adam, how you doing, man?

139
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
I'm like, okay, I'm feeling good.

140
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,120
And this store is literally,

141
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,640
it's where old music gear, and I'm talking instruments,

142
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,440
but also PA systems,

143
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,800
a rack-mounted system.

144
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,640
This is where that shit goes to die, I guess.

145
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,440
It's kind of like that the airfields out there

146
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,280
and what is it?

147
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,160
In the desert in Arizona, where airplanes go to die,

148
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,080
and so I explain the situation, and he's like,

149
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,560
oh man, okay, let's see what we can do.

150
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,000
He's like, I just sold a Mackey board,

151
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,360
which is a well-known brand of mixer.

152
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,920
I just sold out the other day.

153
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,600
He didn't really have any, in fact,

154
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,240
he didn't have any mixers at all.

155
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,000
He had all kinds of outboard gear,

156
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,720
all kinds of rack-mounted stuff, compressors,

157
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,800
limiters, oral, like, ciders,

158
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,800
and we need more oral, like, ciders in our lives, don't we?

159
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,280
All this stuff, and so he basically loads me up

160
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,200
with a whole bunch of cables and stuff,

161
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,720
and so I come back to the condo,

162
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,440
I'm trying to piece everything together,

163
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,200
and I literally found one piece of kit,

164
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,880
which I'm using now, which is just unbelievable.

165
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,240
We've actually been talking about this device

166
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,680
in just in the past week or two,

167
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,800
when we're talking about the Apple,

168
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,840
trademarking endeavors for the word pod,

169
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,320
an iPod, and podcasting, et cetera.

170
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,800
This is, so what I'm doing is I'm running the microphone

171
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,920
through the pod.

172
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
That's right.

173
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,960
This is, if you've never seen one of these things,

174
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,800
what do I call it?

175
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,920
It's the ultimate guitar direct box.

176
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,120
So I just plugged the higher into it,

177
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,960
I selected two preamp, I selected compression,

178
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,880
and a low and behold, it kind of works.

179
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,880
I got a little noise gate on there,

180
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,200
and I'm plugging that directly into cast blaster,

181
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,440
so doing all the mixing on cast blaster itself,

182
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,200
because I couldn't just couldn't get all these other things,

183
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,160
all the work together, they were humming and whatever,

184
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,000
but it was so cool that rock and Rick was able to help me.

185
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,440
He didn't even, he said, go ahead,

186
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,640
come back to Monday or Tuesday or whatever,

187
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,320
and you can pay me then for whatever you use.

188
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,760
It was so awesome, it really was a very nice,

189
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,960
and it's just funny to be using this thing,

190
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,080
this red pod device, pod, you hear that pod, pod, pod, yeah.

191
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,720
I'm calling it a pod, everybody.

192
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,280
A little bit of hiss, but it's working.

193
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,680
So we'll have to use that for for today,

194
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,200
and I guess sometime this afternoon,

195
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,320
I'll see if I can find a board,

196
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,680
maybe Michael Butler has a board that I can borrow,

197
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,560
but I'm kind of vibing on this pod,

198
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,040
they's not bad at all.

199
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,640
We got new members of the pod show family,

200
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,040
who have just announced this,

201
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,520
and some people who've been talking to over a long time,

202
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,880
I think probably three quarters of a year,

203
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,400
trying to get, have you heard me talk about Chef Mark,

204
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,200
and trying to get him into the pod show,

205
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,960
podcast network?

206
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,680
Well, he and some friends are there.

207
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,680
Hi Adam, it's Jennifer from Food Philosophy.

208
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,840
Now that we're officially in bed together,

209
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,480
I'd like for you to step into my kitchen,

210
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,200
where I can evoke your senses with supple textures

211
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,840
and titillating flavors.

212
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,320
I'll try to make sure we're always alone,

213
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,040
but sometimes you might hear from Chef Mark

214
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,400
and the kitchen elves.

215
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,640
Damn it, I'm trying to record over here.

216
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,920
And found!

217
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,720
Sorry, Jennifer, it's these kitchen elves,

218
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,880
they just keep getting into everything.

219
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,320
I'm sorry, Master.

220
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,440
We love the trafals.

221
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,960
As I was saying, Adam,

222
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,960
you can find me at Food Philosophy.podshow.com.

223
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,120
Bring your apron, and we can cook up a little something.

224
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
I can't believe you did that,

225
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,920
we know that I'm very powerful.

226
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,920
You know, it's for nothing but trouble.

227
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,280
The hell is going on there?

228
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,960
Food philosophy.

229
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,520
That's right, I'll part of the Guild of the Fork.

230
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,560
And I think we're gonna hook up with them in New York

231
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,720
if we're lucky.

232
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,400
I'm doing some things,

233
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,400
advertiser, like huge advertising agency,

234
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,040
what we call it, conference, I guess.

235
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,480
It's a full day.

236
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,240
And I'm on a panel with the guys from my space

237
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,200
and the guys, I think the guys from YouTube as well,

238
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,800
so that should be pretty interesting.

239
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,480
If they haven't been bought by Google by then,

240
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,840
although somehow I don't really believe that rumor,

241
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,800
everyone's talking about it.

242
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,720
I think that YouTube must be talking to a lot of different people

243
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,680
and someone let out the Google thing.

244
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,920
But the genies out of the box,

245
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,080
which actually, if they weren't really in deep conversations

246
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,040
and ongoing negotiations with Google, YouTube, that is,

247
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,960
they could probably get a hard time finding anyone else

248
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,160
now at this number of $1.6 billion

249
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,080
has been put out there.

250
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,720
It'd be very interesting to see.

251
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,920
Now the guy that we've been working on

252
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,360
to get into the network,

253
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,080
haven't worked out all the details just yet,

254
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,600
but he's been a fan of his for a long time

255
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,200
and I've talked to him several times.

256
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,560
We've had a lot of back and forth

257
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,520
between his show, I love the company,

258
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,720
and the chacha, the charlie here.

259
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,400
His name is David Epilito,

260
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,360
that guitar man from Central Park,

261
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,560
and he put out a song.

262
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,040
I think he put it out over the weekend.

263
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,320
You've just got to hear this.

264
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,720
This is what I love about music today.

265
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,800
Is it can be topical?

266
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,520
You can have a song out within seconds,

267
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,200
put it up on the podcast, music, network,

268
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
have people all around the globe enjoying it,

269
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,400
playing it on podcasts and just sharing it.

270
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,240
Mama, please, don't let your boys grow up to be pages.

271
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,240
They'll something from thatkatarman.com.

272
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,240
Kids go to DC to learn how the government works.

273
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,240
They'll soon find out that it's all run by sleazebags and jerks.

274
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,760
They'll run countless errors,

275
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,040
stay late, nuts, and weekends work hard,

276
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,320
and then hardly get paid.

277
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,000
By fat sanctimonious self-rack just phony's,

278
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,200
but often just won't get laid.

279
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,200
Mama, don't wreck your babies grow up to be pages.

280
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Or head down to Congress where they'll be in touch

281
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,200
with hypocrites, hasty white perverse and such.

282
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Mama, don't let your babies grow up to be pages.

283
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,200
The belt weighs a black hole that don't have no soul.

284
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,200
Better just let them stay home.

285
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:23,200
Congress has always been good at protecting their asses.

286
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Especially so close to elections that need to be won.

287
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,200
They're out of memory, they shrug and sweep it under the rug.

288
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Say the good old boys, just having fun.

289
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Some well-written spin can't erase any sin.

290
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,200
Just wink, have a drink, and it's done.

291
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Mama, don't let your babies grow up to be pages.

292
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,200
The sex is the least of the dangers they'll know.

293
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,200
They'll soon learn to push it and lie like a pro.

294
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Mama, don't let your babies grow up to be pages.

295
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Yeah, that belt weighs a black hole that don't have no soul.

296
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,200
Better just let them stay home.

297
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,200
I'll see y'all on the Wednesday wake-up call.

298
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
That's David and Polito.

299
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,200
Mama, don't let your boys grow up to be pages.

300
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
I've got a topical soul.

301
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,200
So cute because Christina did another pod save the queen.

302
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,200
If you weren't already subscribed, you didn't get the show already.

303
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,200
It's pod save the queen dot com.

304
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
She really rocked out this time around.

305
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Now I heard from Patricia.

306
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Christina preps her show.

307
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
She takes all kinds of notes and she gets the song.

308
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
She's going to play the Christina my daughter,

309
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,200
which is so I love that.

310
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Following in the family footsteps of show business.

311
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:12,200
And she said, hey, mom, she had some questions about the whole folly thing.

312
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
And she said, but this is so wrong, right?

313
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,200
It's okay if someone's gay, but not with teenage boys.

314
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
And then she did this whole spiel in her podcast,

315
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,200
which you really should hear because it was just cute.

316
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,200
It was so cute to hear how kids perceive these stories,

317
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,200
how they talk about them, how they process them, basically.

318
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Pod save the queen dot pod shot dot com or pod save the queen dot com.

319
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,200
Hey, I just got an email in.

320
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,200
It looks like the planning permission that we've put in on the house that we've been looking at for.

321
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
Oh, shoot, I don't know.

322
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
What is it now?

323
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Three, four weeks.

324
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
The one that had the covenant on the garage.

325
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
The garage.

326
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
It looks like we got all the permission we need.

327
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
So we can go ahead.

328
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Of course, don't you figure that always happens.

329
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
The minute I'm in a different time zone.

330
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
I'm eight hours away.

331
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,200
So now I'm going to have to be doing stuff in the morning and late at night.

332
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
And getting all this stuff squared away.

333
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,200
Because there's just a tremendous amount of paperwork that has to be done in the UK.

334
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,200
And of course, nothing's final until you've completely gone to contract, etc.

335
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,200
So now we have to take the planning permission approval.

336
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
We have to take that to the insurance company.

337
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Because if you do any kind of modification, you want to have some form of insurance.

338
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,200
And so we've got a little rigger moral there that we have to do.

339
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,200
It's going to be, it's going to be quite interesting, my friends.

340
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Hi.

341
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,200
This is your invitation to join me Ed Ovet on a podcast that's out of this world.

342
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:33,200
With a new episode weekly, you'll hear independent artists from all music genres.

343
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
Some comedy?

344
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,200
They know your podcast, there's voice contest with prizes.

345
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,200
And sometimes even a software tip.

346
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:48,200
So why listen to four different podcasts when you can get them all rolled into one on the Ed's Mix Bad Podcast.

347
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,200
You can find me in the iTunes directory.

350
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,200
So I'll be looking for you on the next episode of Ed's Mix Bad.

351
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Just point your browser.

352
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,200
Where else?

353
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Two Ed's Mix Bad.com.

354
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Alright, so this is where not having a Mixer really breaks down when you have no more volume

355
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
left than what people are saying.

356
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Oh, I gotta get that squared away today.

357
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Okay, so...

358
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,200
Cricky, what am I going to tell you?

359
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,200
I'm still a little bit fuzzy just from the jet lag and from the trip.

360
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Although jet, I don't really have jet lag last night, man.

361
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,200
I still had to do some stuff for serious that I was going to record.

362
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,200
I promised PW fenton that I would have all that done by Monday AM.

363
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,200
So this morning, early, so I had to do it last night.

364
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
I couldn't stay away.

365
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,200
I literally passed out on the couch with my glasses on.

366
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,200
You know, glasses completely bent out of shape.

367
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Work up at around 11 last night.

368
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,200
And you know, where you wake up and you've got that completely staggering drunk.

369
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
You just fallen over yourself.

370
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,200
So I had some orange juice, had some tea.

371
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
You know, really had to psych myself.

372
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,200
It wasn't a lot of work.

373
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,200
It's like five minutes worth of work, but I was just so completely trashed.

374
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,200
So we're going to do this week at Pod Show HQ.

375
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,200
We've got a lot of stuff that we've been working on.

376
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,200
And one of the things is video and have some specific ideas that will be coming out with very soon.

377
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:29,200
Actually, over the weekend, some of you may have seen some testing that I was doing at curry.com.

378
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Accidentally kind of flopped out onto the homepage of my weblog.

379
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,200
And then I shoved it over to another place just so I could test it.

380
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,200
If you found it, and you can actually email me because our domain name works again.

381
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
What do you think?

382
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Just messing around trying some stuff out.

383
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Also brand new.

384
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:55,200
This is the season finale, which is the six and final episode of the season of Shadow Falls.

385
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,200
It is out now if you've not heard Shadow Falls immediately go to Shadow Falls.

386
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
PodShow.com.

387
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Do not wait to hear the rest of this show.

388
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
Unless, of course, you're mobile and you can't help yourself.

389
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
You can always find the address on the show.

390
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
It's a daily source code dot com.

391
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,200
Add Shadow Falls dot pod show dot com.

392
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Audio drama and it's best.

393
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,200
And you want cliffhangers?

394
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,200
We got cliffhangers.

395
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
Hi, this is Kappa Victoria Wood.

396
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Hi, Holly Jenkins.

397
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Hello, this urban.

398
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
And Tracy Crouch.

399
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:30,200
We're the babes from the cast of Shadow Falls at Shadow Falls dot pod show dot com.

400
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:37,200
And you're listening to Adam Curry's daily source code.

401
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:44,200
See, we got to get Shadow Falls back for our second season.

402
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Because now all of a sudden, the ladies from the show are waking up.

403
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,200
Now I've got the hot babes calling me.

404
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
Hmm.

405
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,200
And I speak in of which no phone calls today because I can't play external sound effects.

406
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,200
It's a whole long story, but it's all a part of the not having a mixer.

407
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,200
So I hope you'll just bear with me and be able to get through it.

408
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Oh, man.

409
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
I'm so totally spacing.

410
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
It's so weird.

411
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,200
You know, you get used to a certain sound when you're doing this stuff.

412
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:22,200
And my studio at home at the cottage is so precisely just everything like that.

413
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,200
You really become conscious of listening to listening to everything.

414
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,200
Yeah, let me just, I'll play on, I'll mess with this pod for a second.

415
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
First of me take the noise gate off.

416
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
So now you hear the noise in the background, right?

417
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Isn't that interesting?

418
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
This works really, really well.

419
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Now I'm going to put the noise gate back on.

420
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
There we go.

421
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Now I could actually change any of the settings on this thing.

422
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Because this is meant for guitars, right?

423
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
So.

424
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Oops.

425
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Hello.

426
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Hello.

427
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Wait a minute.

428
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Wait a minute.

429
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
I can't get it through.

430
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Screw it.

431
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
I didn't work very well.

432
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,200
It's going to give you a little example of how that work.

433
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,200
We got a brand new sponsor, which I'm going to tell you about.

434
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,200
I'm very excited about because it's a product that I actually use.

435
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Haven't used it in the UK yet.

436
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
But hold on.

437
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,200
I'll give you that in a second.

438
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:24,200
Where is the, what I'm looking for actually is the,

439
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,200
Oh, man, I can't believe I can't find this.

440
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,200
Here we go.

441
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
See what I was looking for.

442
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,200
Right on.

443
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
Okay.

444
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,200
So please do call me.

445
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,200
Let me know if you were finally able to get through and listen to the show.

446
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,200
And I'll have a mixture and all that stuff ready to roll by tomorrow.

447
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,200
And we'll, uh, and we'll continue with yet another Charlie.

448
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
Okay.

449
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,200
New sponsor.

450
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
I don't know if you ever heard of this stuff.

451
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,200
It's called Splenda.

452
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
And it's, uh,

453
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Yeah.

454
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Well, it's a sugar substitute.

455
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,200
Um, if you go to destinationflavor.com.

456
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Uh, that's the website that explains all the new products.

457
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
Basically this, uh, the sugar,

458
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
do they even call it a sugar substitute?

459
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,200
Let me see if they have a name for it.

460
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
Uh, uh, um.

461
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

462
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...

463
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Product background.

464
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
Here we go.

465
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
I've got the whole background around it.

466
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
So let's figure this out together.

467
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
Splenda.

468
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Flavor blends for coffee.

469
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,200
It's a delicious new product from the makers of Splenda.

470
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,200
It's a no calorie sweetener, uh, each flavor blends for coffee,

471
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,200
packet contains a combination of Splenda, no calorie sweetener.

472
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
And one of three delicious flavors.

473
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
So you can sweeten and flavor your cup of coffee at the same time.

474
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:04,240
time. So they're available in vanilla, French vanilla, mocha and hazelnut flavors. So what

475
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:12,000
I thought we'd do is have you tell me what your flavor is? I'll be experimenting this

476
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:20,200
week. As you know, I'm a big proponent of the Senseo. So I don't have a Senseo machine here

477
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:26,840
at the condo. It's actually better. I have a cappuccino maker, espresso maker. So

478
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,840
now we have all these different flavors at the office. I think we've had them for a while. They've

479
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,320
been hanged. At least ten, ten weeks, maybe even three months. Since the last time I was here,

480
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:41,960
I know that they were laying around near the Beverage Center at Potio HQ. And I'm going to

481
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:47,640
be testing a different flavor every single day and giving feedback to you. And I'd like you to

482
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:54,600
try it out as well. In fact, there's a special number that is set up for you to call in and tell

483
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:05,320
us about which flavor you like. You ready? You might want to write this down. It's a 206-604-145-206-604-155.

484
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:10,280
Of course, I'll put the number in the show notes. But give it a try. Let me know what you think.

485
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:15,880
Do we have any goodies or anything at the Send-Anybody? I want to send people this stuff so they

486
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:23,400
can try it out. Hmm. Okay. I really should have read this whole. This is an incredibly long briefing

487
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:31,160
that I've got here. Oh, they have even, they have a Q&A. What is Splendid No Calorie Sweetener? Answer?

488
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,600
Splendid No Calorie Sweetener is especially formulated brand of sweetener. There's made from sugar,

489
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,760
so it tastes like sugar. It's available in distinctive yellow packets. Ah, that's the trick. The yellow

490
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,280
packets. Right. Convenient for sweetening drinks and sprinkling on cereal. Oh, man. What else could

491
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,640
you sprinkle it on? Use another question. Is Splendid No Calorie Sweetener suitable for the

492
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,360
entire family? Yes. Splendid No Calorie Sweetener suitable for everyone, including children and

493
00:27:54,360 --> 00:28:01,400
people with diabetes. Hmm. Is it considered a natural product? No. The sweetener used in Splendid

494
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:09,160
Sweetener products is sucralose. Sucralose? Those sucralose is made from sugar and has sugar like

495
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:16,440
taste. Sucralose itself is not natural. I like it though. I have to be honest. I have tried the

496
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,440
French vanilla. I'm not tried the other. I don't know about hazelnut. I don't know a big hazelnut

497
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,320
guy. If you've seen these or if you've tried them out, or if you want to, let me know. I think

498
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:33,880
I should be able to send out packets of this. Again, call us at 206-600-4415. One more sign to get

499
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:41,240
out of here. This is from those wonderfuls. They all call it a wonderfuls. This is the Hillbilly

500
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:47,640
song. Unsign band from the UK, now on the bot save music network. This should get you rolling.

501
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,640
Hey, what's up, Naver?

502
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,120
I'll leave him all alone and I'll do that one nobody else.

503
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:41,800
I got what you want, Naver. I got what you need, Naver. I got what you want, Naver. I'll save it for myself.

504
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,040
I'll leave, I'm a silverat. I just don't want nobody else.

505
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,240
I'll leave, I'm a silverat. I do not want nobody else.
