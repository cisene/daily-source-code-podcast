00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Dilta Sierra Charley, 3-3-0.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
$16 billion worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Transmores?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We don't need nuss thinking crazy.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm just kidding.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We got a whole fresh week

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
that we can look at with great resentment.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's Monday everybody how you do it.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is the daily source code.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
No sign of weather, not a cloud in the sky.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Taking it easy, I was doing just fine.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's got as my witness.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I was minding my business when she knew.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In the tenest like it, drop it to the breeze.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Face like an angel exes along as she pleased.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll never forget it.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I got all caught up in it.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
She was the object of my affection, then.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
When changed direction.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Like that, you shutters in your doors.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But you love your phone as your lawyer.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Mercy when she raised down on you.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You've been telling you've been warned.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You don't know what you're meant for.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
She's a perfect star.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Once she comes, you'll never be the same.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So you better stay away from her, I can't change.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
She held like thunder when the sky opened up.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I started shaking when the lightning struck.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
My poor heart was breaking.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Where they removed.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
She was making them.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
She blew right over just as quick as she came.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
She probably don't even remember my name.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm a romantic speechless trying to figure the pieces.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Just another seduction in her path of destruction.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Like that, you shutters in your doors.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But you love your phone as your lawyer.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Mercy when she raised down on you.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You've been telling you've been warned.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You don't know what you're meant for.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
She's a perfect star.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Once she comes, you'll never be the same.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So you better stay away from her, I can't change.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Once she comes, you'll never be the same.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So you better stay away from her, I can't you.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Once she comes, you'll never be the same.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The way from Hurricane Jane, once she comes, you'll never be the same, so you've got to stay away from Hurricane.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I can't get you shutters and your doors, but in a hurry, you've got to stop.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Lord and mercy, when she race, I don't know you.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You've been told you've been warned, you don't know what going for.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
She's a perfect storm, better stay inside, where it's safe and warm.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And once she comes, you'll never be the same, so you better stay away from Hurricane Jane.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Once she comes, you'll never be the same, so you better stay away from Hurricane Jane.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Colin Ray, Hurricane Jane, on a Spirion Spearion Records.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You can find that at the pod save music network.

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Nothing like a bit of country to get you going, eh?

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Find that at music.podshow.com.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's Monday, everybody.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
How you doing?

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Whole new week of daily source codes coming your way.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
My last week here in the cottage before it's off to New York.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
London, San Francisco, Netherlands, all kinds of traveling coming up.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's going to be very, very busy couple of weeks.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Let me see.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Kind of slow start today.

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I tried to watch the Super Bowl last night.

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It was on Sky One.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And it started, well, of course, the pregame started at 10 a.m.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
10 p.m.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And the actual game kickoff didn't start until 11.30.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So I sat there and watched, I sat there and watched most of it, actually.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What the hell was going on with the sound?

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't know if we were listening to a different feed of stuff,

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
or if it was just crap, I mean, tell me, please,

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
but the Stevie Wonder pregame show, dude.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It was like, here's just stone.

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And you could hear microphones were all over the play.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And the music track was just that.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The track, no one was actually playing in the instruments live.

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But they could not get the sound right.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It sounded totally crap.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't know if it was wireless mics interfering with each other.

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Actually, I did see that they were using a particular type of microphone

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
that I would not have chosen for just stone.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Nor for a read the Franklin and Aaron Neville, who did the star-spangled banner

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
same thing.

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You know, and Aaron Neville's already, you know, he kind of has a wimpy voice.

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It was just, it was like there was a gate on it, or some just, it was messed up,

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and it was horrible.

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And then, of course, I watched a kickoff, and I was like 12, 15,

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and, you know, the first quarter just about ended, and I can't handle it.

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So congrats to the, to the Steelers, of course, coming from a short stint

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and West Virginia at school, both the Steelers.

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And, of course, the penguins are teams that I followed quite a bit.

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And not bad, the way the sea hawks presented themselves, I think.

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That was damn good.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And I read this morning, because, of course, I didn't make it to halftime.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Because, gee, we really needed to see the rolling stones.

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm sorry, the stones now in my mind are officially just pathetic.

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You know, they agreed to do all this stuff, and I didn't see the performance,

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
so I can't really say too much about it.

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But apparently, sensors deemed too lyrics too sexually explicit to be broadcast.

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
They were cut from the three song shows.

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Starting me up in rough justice, we're subject to censorship, says the BBC.

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The satisfaction was left intact.

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Again, what did they pull out?

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You make a dead man calm, is that it?

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Isn't that why we haven't been playing that on a radio for 30 years?

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's just crazy.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And that the stones would agree to do that.

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It was just, that was just disappointing.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Do people really care about the rolling stones anymore?

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It just seems like, let me Patricia, who grew, you know, back in the day before I was born.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You, well, I was born, but before I was cognizant of what was going on in the music world,

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
you either were for the Beatles or you were for the stones.

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You rarely were for both, you know, you stood behind one of those.

120
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And Patricia was definitely a stones fan.

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
She was just, she was like, this is dumb.

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This is no good.

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You know, the press conference, there's, I don't know.

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Whatever.

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That's fine.

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
To each zone, I guess.

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Lots of work being done over the weekend.

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And just the end of last week between PW Fenton and Cast Blaster Mike.

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I've been bitching and moaning about my computer apparently not being able to keep time,

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
or at least not being able to keep time and sync with other computers,

131
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
specifically PW Fenton's computer.

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Didn't know if it was cast blast or didn't know if it was this countdown time,

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
or everything seemed to be all over the map.

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And, well, some work was done.

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And Mike is going to explain it all himself.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hi, Adam.

137
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's cast blast or Mike.

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
With a very boring story, so I'm not sure if you're going to play this.

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But at least, you know, how it works.

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Just wanted to explain the time of problem.

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Everyone's been talking about.

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yes, there are different timers in each,

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
B.C.

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
There is the clock, which is what you see in the screen.

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You see in the bottom right corner of the screen,

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
which runs even when the P.C. is off.

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And then there are several timers in the hardware,

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
which only run when the P.C. is on.

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And then there is the timer in the sound card,

150
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and often there are more than one,

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
one for playback, one for recording.

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And they are all not calibrated,

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
simply because it's too expensive.

154
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The problem you had with cast blast

155
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
was actually in the error of,

156
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
of me of Mike.

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It was a little rounding error,

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and the more it added up.

159
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And so in the end, after in your case,

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
24 and a half minute, the error was five seconds.

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But it wouldn't have been too bad

162
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
if you would have watched that timer.

163
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But anyway, I fixed a bug,

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and now it's accurate up to a microsecond.

165
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And it's independent of the clocks and timers in your machine.

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's basically the time pro in the MP3 file itself.

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So if serious uses an accurate timer,

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and playing the file,

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
which they do as a P.C.

170
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and then all problems are fixed now.

171
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And it's far more accurate than it's necessary.

172
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So I'm going to send you new beta soon,

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and you can get that a try,

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and hopefully we can like,

175
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
heat up alive a little bit,

176
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
a little bit better.

177
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
No, yeah.

178
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's my mission.

179
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That's it for now.

180
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Bye-bye.

181
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Cast blasted Mike on the microphone, everybody.

182
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And he did indeed send me another special

183
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
podfather edition data.

184
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And it's really cool because now in the title bar

185
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
of the window of Cast Blaster, it actually has a countdown timer

186
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
that is counting back.

187
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I can see 13 minutes and 49 seconds now.

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You pre-configure that under the Configure tab.

189
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And what's really nice is one minute before the time expires,

190
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
the whole window, the Cast Blaster,

191
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
basically starts to kind of flashing glow,

192
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
not irritating,

193
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
but enough to catch your attention.

194
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So we'll see how it works out.

195
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I mean, the theory behind all of this is what Mike has now done

196
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
is he's basically taking the dividing the samples by the sample rate

197
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
and that should equal the time exactly out to a microsecond

198
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
or something like that.

199
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'd be couldn't get a little more precise,

200
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Mike only a microsecond.

201
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And so this should play back exactly the same amount of time

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
as it was recorded.

203
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's cool.

204
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's great that we came up with this issue

205
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
and we're able to fix it really quickly.

206
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I like doing that.

207
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
That's the kind of development I like.

208
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Lots of talk about this about AOL and Yahoo,

209
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
who are going to start charging,

210
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I think it's a quarter cent per email cent

211
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
to anyone within their network using their email system.

212
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The details are intricate,

213
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and there's basically there's a white list

214
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
and then there's a guaranteed delivery list

215
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and there'll be a read receipt list.

216
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It seems like,

217
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
yeah,

218
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
it seems to me like not the best way to do this.

219
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I think drawing the analogy to the old postal world

220
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
really misses out on a lot of exciting things that we could be doing.

221
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And already a lot of people said,

222
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
hey, you know, why don't you just use RSS for that type of stuff

223
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
which is basically the published and subscribe mechanism

224
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
that podcasting use and web logs use it with your newsletter.

225
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And I think that that as an underpinning

226
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and you know, a way to basically unsubscribe

227
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
from a stream of information coming in

228
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
rather than trying to figure out how to block it.

229
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Of course, it makes total total sense.

230
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But we're going to have to do a lot of work on the interfaces.

231
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The first thing we have to do is hide RSS.

232
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You know, that's maybe this is where the stuff like newsletter

233
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and the plugins that you put into your outlook.

234
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The basically make the new stories look like email messages.

235
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I think that's probably the way to go

236
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
and then of course you still need to figure out

237
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
how people discover and subscribe to things that they're actually interested in.

238
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I do believe that people will subscribe to RSS feeds

239
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
of just commercials.

240
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
In fact, I do it all the time.

241
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I subscribe to promo.podshow.com

242
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
which is nothing more than a feed of commercials.

243
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I love listening to it.

244
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
From time to time, I pick something out and play it on the show.

245
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But we have to do a lot of work on hiding it.

246
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Wait it with email.

247
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
If you want to make it basically email that you can unsubscribe

248
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
from commercial messages, then we're going to have to do a lot of work.

249
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's really the same magic that I always intended RSS to,

250
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
that's always the way I intended RSS to function with podcasting

251
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
because you don't see it.

252
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You know, it's just keep it away.

253
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And of course, it is still very, very prevalent.

254
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Right up there with the VHS and beta

255
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and all those other wonderful acronyms that we come up with,

256
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
that we think consumers are really interested in.

257
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Lost it update.

258
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't know if I told you, but on the 28th of February, 2005,

259
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
my suit against the publisher of magazine

260
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and the chief editors,

261
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
is two of them of magazine and Netherlands.

262
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
We'll come before the court in Amsterdam.

263
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Very bullish about this, obviously.

264
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Professor Lawrence Lessick has checked in

265
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and said that he's available to do anything necessary

266
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
to help he thinks it's very important, obviously.

267
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And this is being followed very closely by many people,

268
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
many of them lawyers who are interested to see really what

269
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
the power of the creative commons license will be.

270
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
For those of you who don't know what happened,

271
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
a magazine basically took my pictures off of my flicker page,

272
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
which are very clearly marked with a creative commons license

273
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
of attribution non-commercial share-like.

274
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And I want to ask me, and of course, they're completely commercial.

275
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
In fact, they promoted the fact that these pictures

276
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
were on the inside on the cover full page.

277
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And in my mind, and this is something that I'm working on

278
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
with my team on, we have to draw the analogy and say,

279
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
look, you know, if you download one song illegally

280
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and you're caught as a consumer,

281
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
immediately you get the RIA and their settlement bureau,

282
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
nagging your ass, you know, they'll give you anywhere from

283
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
15,000 to $150,000 fine.

284
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Which is, by the way, is not a court fine,

285
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
it's just they say that that's what they're going to sue you for

286
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
and then you can usually wind up settling for $4,000.

287
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And I feel that if that can be happening in today's day and age,

288
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
then it should work the other way around.

289
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
When mainstream media becomes so arrogant,

290
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
they think that they can take stuff from us.

291
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Well, they're going to find out what that means.

292
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I can't mention the person who sent this to me,

293
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
but he says it's been listening for about 10 months now.

294
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
This was my question about Defra.

295
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
This is the agricultural department that has a building

296
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
very close to the cottage that has these huge cell phone towers,

297
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
which may or may not be affecting our health,

298
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
the jury is definitely still out on that.

299
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
He says that most of the building is now occupied by IBM staff.

300
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
He works for them as well,

301
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
following the outsourcing of Defra's IT last year.

302
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
He works there about 50% of the week.

303
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Hey, neighbor, how are you doing?

304
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Not sure where you got your information about the mobile mass in 2007,

305
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
but all I know is that as part of the outsourcing contract,

306
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
IBM will not allow to relocate X-Defra staff

307
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
from the site for three years,

308
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
starting October, 2004.

309
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I think the picture beyond that is still unclear.

310
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
If you hear anything else, I'll let you know.

311
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Okay.

312
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And so I wasn't allowed to say who we was,

313
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
or give any more clues and understandably so.

314
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We don't want you in trouble,

315
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
because you are my deep throat across the street.

316
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Hey, and on Saturday, Christina wanted to go visit Owen.

317
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Owen the emo her boyfriend,

318
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
who lives in South Hampton,

319
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
which is about 40 miles,

320
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
so all in all about 55 minutes to an hour's drive,

321
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and Patricia and I said,

322
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
ah, what the hell, you know,

323
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
of course we'll take you down.

324
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
We'll drop you off and we'll go mess around

325
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
for a couple hours.

326
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
We'll find something to do.

327
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And as we neared South Hampton,

328
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
we saw the signs for Bournemouth,

329
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
and I've heard many things about Bournemouth.

330
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's really, it's on the southern coast of England,

331
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and it's kind of like a co-type situation

332
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
where the warm golf stream flows through.

333
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And there are even palm trees,

334
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
another tropical foliage to be found

335
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
in that particular part of the UK.

336
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And it was really only what?

337
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
There's another 30 miles or 40 miles from South Hampton,

338
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
so we dropped Christina off.

339
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It was shitty weather, unfortunately.

340
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Right, right, man.

341
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
By the way, I'd never driven the jag

342
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
for such a long distance.

343
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What an enjoyable car.

344
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Oh, man.

345
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Particularly the,

346
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
was it the predictive,

347
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
is it called predictive cruise control?

348
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Not predictive.

349
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Maybe it is what that's called.

350
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Where basically maintains your speed,

351
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
based upon the speed of the car in front of you,

352
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
what an enjoyable way to drive,

353
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and just a nice ride.

354
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
We set the cruise at 90 all the way down,

355
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
and it was like we were doing 50.

356
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It wouldn't have made any difference.

357
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It was quiet.

358
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
We could have a nice conversation.

359
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It was comfortable.

360
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Of course, this is a huge highway,

361
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
so it was really quite okay to do that.

362
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What are the, what actually are the speed limits here in the UK?

363
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I mean, what is the speed limit when it's not posted?

364
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'd like to know that.

365
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I know that in some zones at 60,

366
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
it's 50, I've seen 30 signs,

367
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
but I really don't know what it is on the,

368
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
on the open freeway.

369
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Hopefully, I should know this, of course,

370
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
being a licensed driver.

371
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But Bournemouth was really nice.

372
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I've heard a lot of people kind of slide it off saying,

373
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
oh, you know, it's where old people go to die.

374
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But I liked it.

375
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You know, we had tea,

376
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
overlooking the ocean and the beach,

377
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and there's a great airport there.

378
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Bournemouth,

379
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
international airport,

380
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
which has an ILS instrument landing system.

381
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Hey, that might be a potential place to build,

382
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
to build the next house.

383
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Which, of course, is still,

384
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
you know, at least a year away from now,

385
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
but very interesting, very interesting indeed.

386
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Let's see.

387
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Hey, Adam, this is KFC from the pod chick show at pod chick.com,

388
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
and also on the pod show now.

389
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Thank you so much.

390
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Hey, I wanted to tell you that I'm just a series

391
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
as those quasi-poly guys are.

392
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And I would love,

393
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I mean, love to be on before the beep of,

394
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
hey, the satellite window is closed.

395
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So if you could please do that,

396
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
we could save a lot,

397
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
a little goats,

398
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
because you know how that little goat got it?

399
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Well, there's lots more little goats out there,

400
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and I'd hate to see them lose it.

401
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So if you could get us on,

402
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
we're very serious about it.

403
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So, make them smile.

404
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Help me out.

405
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Do you believe anything is possible?

406
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
We do.

407
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
We're our flank.

408
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
We believe in an internet

409
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
that's safe from viruses and scammers.

410
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
We're our flank.

411
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
We believe your personal information

412
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
to be just that, personal.

413
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And we believe your internet

414
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
should be a friend, not a foe.

415
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
We're our flank.

416
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Make this smart choice.

417
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000

418
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000

419
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000

Earthlink.

421
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
We revolve around you.

422
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Okay, all you, this is out there.

423
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I only have one advice.

424
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Quit your job.

425
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Quit your job.

426
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I've got to make a mortgage pay.

427
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm here.

428
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I've got a wife and kids.

429
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm telling you.

430
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I listen.

431
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I've got expenses.

432
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Good work.

433
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You can have that job.

434
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I said,

435
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I listen to this podcast on business success tips.

436
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I quit my job.

437
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I'm now rich in payments.

438
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I get laid all the time.

439
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I have lots of fun.

440
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You can do the same thing.

441
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Hey Adam.

442
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
This is Chef Mark from the remarkable Palette podcast

443
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
in New York City.

444
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And here's one of my kitchen quick tips.

445
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
A tip for poaching eggs.

446
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Add a splash of vinegar or lemon juice

447
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
to the poaching water.

448
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Just before adding the eggs.

449
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
The acid in the water will help to quickly

450
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
coagulate the egg proteins

451
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and keep the egg white from running all over.

452
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Ensuring an attractive poached egg.

453
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
For more tips, recipes,

454
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and interviews with food professionals,

455
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
listen to the remarkable Palette podcast.

456
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You can find me at remarkablepalette.blogspot.com

457
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
or on the iTunes directory.

458
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And now back to the daily source code with Adam Curry.

459
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You'll buddy.

460
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That's kind of confusing.

461
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So there's a Chef Mark in New York City.

462
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And then of course there's Chef Mark in San Francisco

463
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
who travels all over the place to London

464
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
and did the big PIA for us.

465
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
That's confusing.

466
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I think that you guys should do a three round mud vessel

467
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
battle it out for the name.

468
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And it's both spelled the same way.

469
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The satellite window has about two and a half minutes

470
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
before closing.

471
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So those of you listening to this podcast on

472
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
serious stars 103.

473
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Pacific Coast.

474
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Hellwide coming up in just moments.

475
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
East radio with Madge Weinstein.

476
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Don and Drew.

477
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
All the kids.

478
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
They'll tell 10 p.m. Eastern 7 p.m. Pacific Times.

479
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Syria stars 103.

480
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I did want to just say,

481
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
you know, well, everyone's listening.

482
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
They said this is Bruhah.

483
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
This violence really.

484
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
About pictures of the profit Mohammed has caught me

485
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
a little bit by surprise.

486
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I had no idea.

487
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
First of all, I had no idea that there's a law.

488
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
That says if you disgrace the profit Mohammed that you

489
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
should be killed.

490
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And apparently it's also illegal by Islam.

491
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Muslim law or Islam to even depict the profit at all.

492
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Boy, I think we're certainly learning some lessons here

493
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
because the outrage of this is sparked is I'd say

494
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
concerning at the very least.

495
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I mean, if someone's pissed off at a newspaper here in the UK

496
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
as an example or in the US, what typically happens is there's a

497
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
boycott against the publication.

498
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The publication is held to account.

499
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And yeah, someone might throw some rocks and some firebombs

500
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
and maltov cocktails at the offices of the newspaper

501
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
that offended anyone at this group.

502
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But instead, everyone's taken to burning embassies.

503
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
This is, I didn't expect that, which means and probably

504
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
of the thousands of people who demonstrated outside of these embassies

505
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
and torch them.

506
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I would wager that a large portion didn't even see the pictures.

507
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And that they were just driven by pure emotion and anger

508
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
and feeling of misunderstanding.

509
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And this is a problem.

510
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It really, really, really is a problem.

511
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Because this just shows you how many people are extremely offended

512
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
by this and are willing to take violent action.

513
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And it's much, much more than I ever anticipated.

514
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
We're going to continue talking about this on the podcast.

515
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
But first, I want to say goodbye.

516
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Hopefully, exactly on time this time for the satellite window

517
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
to our serious listeners.

518
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
We'll catch you all on the Tuesday's edition of the show.

519
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Boom, exactly 24 minutes and 30 seconds.

520
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
We continue now.

521
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And I really don't know what to say.

522
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
First of all, I'm kind of looking for other Muslim leaders to stand up

523
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
and call for some calm and for some thought about this.

524
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Clearly, everyone has to learn.

525
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And it has to go from both sides because we're very used to being ridiculed

526
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
for anything here in, I'll just say the West.

527
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I don't even know if that's correct to say it that way.

528
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
But shoot, I got ridiculed all the time.

529
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
People make character chores and say nasty things.

530
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And I don't go out and threaten to kill anyone.

531
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
If they say it about my family, about my parents,

532
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
about what I believe in, what else is there?

533
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Maybe that's a better question.

534
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
What else is there that we should know?

535
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
What are the ground rules of other things we can't do to avoid this?

536
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I'm not saying we have to, but I'd really like to know

537
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
where the pressure points are going to be.

538
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Because for me, the big question is,

539
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
did the Danish publication know about this?

540
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Did they know what kind of outrageous was spark?

541
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Were they doing it just to prove a point?

542
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
That's the stuff I'd like to know.

543
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And let's keep our eye on this.

544
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
There's something going on that we need to pay attention to.

545
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Linda Smith sent me an email saying that she's having big problems

546
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
uploading her feed, getting it to work.

547
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Actually, I have a whole segment.

548
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I want to talk about a whole bunch of different people

549
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
who've been having trouble getting started in podcasting.

550
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Linda says I'm getting very discouraged.

551
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Recording it was easy.

552
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I've already spent $80 in a very good microphone.

553
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
One recommended by podcast solutions.

554
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I await its delivery even as I type.

555
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And then she set it up a show site at blogger.com.

556
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Worldwide eroticlove.blogspot.com.

557
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And this is one of the got me.

558
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It would be an honor to be promoted or praised on your show.

559
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I call you the John Peel of podcasters.

560
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You remember the British rock DJ John Peel?

561
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
What he did from any British rock bands?

562
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
He died.

563
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
He's dead.

564
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I don't want to be the John Peel of anything, please.

565
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Let's listen to a little bit of Linda because it kind of caught me by surprise.

566
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Everybody.

567
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
This is got us, Linda.

568
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Live on erotic podcast tonight forever.

569
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Berkeley, California.

570
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Just what the heck am I supposed to say now?

571
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Why believe that a quality sexual education is going to be a

572
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
American and the world's the safer place.

573
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Far better, more active.

574
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Far better, more effective than.

575
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Ask this only program.

576
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
You see, so far I was like into it, right?

577
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm like, okay.

578
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
This, this is interesting.

579
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Let's listen to it.

580
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Don't they tell you just say no.

581
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Is, why take a sexual education.

582
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And entertain it.

583
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And every y'all says sexual.

584
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Please, keep you put me.

585
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You can set the adults only.

586
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Anyway, what the heck am I supposed to say next?

587
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
The podcasting book tells me you just focus talking to one person.

588
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So the heck with it, am I supposed to pick somebody who I love?

589
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Why am I really hot and sexy?

590
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
My darling favorite rock star, jibby page.

591
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Oh, jibby page.

592
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Beautiful, sweetest, sexiest, silkyest lips.

593
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Oh, my darling, your jibby page.

594
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I want to ride your cock.

595
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Oh, no.

596
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Right.

597
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So, and it goes on for like another minute and forty-six seconds.

598
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I think it definitely gets some attention.

599
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Linda with your podcast.

600
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Let me give you about the URL again.

601
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Was it?

602
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But this is, I was just interested to hear how many people are definitely having issues

603
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
getting up and running.

604
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And they're following the books and the websites.

605
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Worldwide eroticlove.blogspot.com.

606
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
That's it.

607
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
So that'll just be an intro to a couple of different types of feedback I got.

608
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Here's one from Frank and apologize for emailing you like this.

609
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
My question regarding the website aspect of podcasting.

610
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I know about blogger, lives in a feed burner, but I have no clue what these do.

611
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It seems like I need a combination of several of these services.

612
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I just don't know why.

613
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I have a domain name register, but I don't know what to do from there.

614
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I would like my webpage to have its own email and its own name without a dot

615
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Lipsin dot com after my own domain name.

616
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And then it just goes on, you know, to basically clue this about how to get this started.

617
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And you know what?

618
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It is rather daunting.

619
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
There's a lot of steps you have to take.

620
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:24,000
This of course is what we set out to solve with the podcast delivery network and the pod show podcast network.

621
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And we now have, I think, I saw the last list about 20 people beta testing now.

622
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And again, this is two sides.

623
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
This is a listener side that seamlessly because you can be a listener.

624
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
You can be a podcaster at the same time.

625
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
So kind of flows seamlessly into each other.

626
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And it takes away all of those problems.

627
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,000
In fact, if you use cast blaster and I have that set up now, you'll just record, you'll hit publish and it's done.

628
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Your show notes go in, your feed is taken care of everything.

629
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Everything is completely done.

630
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So look forward to that coming.

631
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I think we're about ready to let some more beta testers and I looked over the weekend and even more stuff that started to change.

632
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
So it's definitely getting very, very exciting.

633
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
More questions about the pod safe music network and the podcast delivery network.

634
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Hey, I'm Russell Henson here.

635
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Just wanted to provide a bit of feedback on my experience trying to join me at

636
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
music.putshare.com as a new podcaster.

637
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I'm trying to put together my first astronomy podcast.

638
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And I wanted to include some pod safe music in there.

639
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So I went to the music.

640
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
The pod shared a calm to try and find a sample.

641
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I could put in and put out for people to have a listen to and give me some feedback.

642
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And I find out I can actually download any music that I can insert as an audio file until I sign up, which is all good.

643
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:58,000
But going through the silent process, I find I have to have all my details such as my podcast name, blah, blah, blah.

644
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And my podcast feed, which has to be a valid feed, all sorted out and ready to go.

645
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Maybe I'm doing things back to front to everyone else, but I'm trying to get all the audio together and have a show done up.

646
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
So I can then create my feed and my show and my links and all that sort of stuff.

647
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
But I can do that unless I'm already signed up and got the music.

648
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
So I'm feeling a bit lost here.

649
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Do I need to sign up first to get some music?

650
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Have I got something wrong here?

651
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Do I just have to go with some dummy audio loop for now or something or other until I get it all sorted out?

652
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And then I can add the music later.

653
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Not sure, but it's just confusing to me and not that might be some confusing to other people signing up as well.

654
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So just sort of put it out to you see if you had any solutions, if I missed something or whether that's the way it is.

655
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And I just have to keep with it for now.

656
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Okay, thanks a lot.

657
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Well, yeah, that is the way it is.

658
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
For right now, you would have to cope with it.

659
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
The reason why we did that, of course, is the pod safe music network is really intended for two groups.

660
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Initially, for podcasters and for artists who want to make their music available for podcasters to play.

661
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:22,000
So we're going to we presume that you have a podcast and you have details of that podcast when you register.

662
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Otherwise, you're invited to do anything you want browse through the site as a listener, which means you can't download the songs, but you can listen to them right there streaming.

663
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Just click the little play button next to any one of them.

664
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Now, of course, another feature of the podcast library network means you'll have a single sign on one log on and it will log you into podcast alley.

665
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:51,000
For all, you know, if you really want to get down to the dirty in the backstage business of podcasting, that's the place to go.

666
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Seamless log into the pod safe music network.

667
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Oh, man, it's a double-senseo show.

668
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And so all your details, of course, that's another step you won't have to take because, you know, obviously when you sign up, you're a podcaster.

669
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
We have all your information about your feed, et cetera, and the details of the show.

670
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,000
So you're automatically registered and in fact, it's a couple more extra widgets that will become available.

671
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And it's just what this next comment is about.

672
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Adam, this is Chris from the fallout at Disciple Zero.

673
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
That's z-e-r-o dot c-r-x dot com.

674
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I've been working on some radio software, and we've got some pretty cool ideas.

675
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,000
We're planning on making a slightly stripped down version, basically pulling satellite keys and such.

676
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Anyway, we're thinking about putting in a newsy interface to the PMN.

677
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
So it could automatically register plays and pull music, pre-cash, and that sort of thing.

678
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
So, so people didn't have to worry about that kind of stuff.

679
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Question I had for you is, is there a way to pull RSS feeds of categories or searches,

680
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
since in an XML format, rather than scraping the web pages.

681
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Thanks for your time, Adam, and don't bother checking out the file quite yet because we're still working on switching our web hosts and such.

682
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So it can actually support that.

683
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Thanks a lot again. Have a great show.

684
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I love the idea, and we actually have set up a developer program, specifically for stuff like this.

685
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And first of all, yes, the answer is yes.

686
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
The whole, everything is all based on XML.

687
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
So you'll be able to get RSS feeds of searches, of categories, of songs you've played.

688
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
We even have modules like that for the show sites automatically.

689
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It'll, it'll, uh, throw up a list of, uh, of the song, the last songs that you played,

690
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
or the top songs and the positive music network.

691
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
So of course, whatever this tool is that you're making, which sounds really cool and secretive.

692
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Uh, yeah, a go to a podshow, a developer dot podshow dot com Andrew Grummit, who, of course,

693
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
you probably know from juice or iPod or lemon.

694
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,000
He, uh, worked from day one, basically, on that project is now running the, uh,

695
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
the developer community at podshow.

696
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And in addition to, uh, whatever your, your radio tool is or your recording tool,

697
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
you can also tie it directly into the pdn.

698
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And so, um, you can post directly, uh, into the pdn from your application.

699
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Same thing, api is available and nothing really new or fancy as far as I know.

700
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It's all based on open standards.

701
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I think actually for the pdn, we're using the, uh, the meta web log api.

702
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
So you'll be able to, to, to scrunch it in no problem.

703
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Uh, I suggest you drop by a developer dot podshow dot com and, uh,

704
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
give Andrew a shout and, uh, and start the dialogue up there.

705
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I'll be more than happy to hear from you.

706
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And finally, uh, Bruce, I guess Bruce basically says the same thing, uh,

707
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
looking to, um, looking for RSS feed output of searches.

708
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
So for instance, uh, and, and by the way, I'm mentioning all this because I know that the guys and

709
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
gal's developing are not listening in.

710
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So, um, Bruce's idea is, for example, genre would be hip hop upload would be,

711
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
you know, within the past seven days, download count would be less than five.

712
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Uh, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

713
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Um, and yeah, I think that would be, that would be an awesome, an awesome tool to add for,

714
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
uh, for podcasters at the Apothecate Music Network, you betcha.

715
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Um, okay.

716
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Oh, my goodness.

717
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Where are we at now?

718
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Okay.

719
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Look at your iPod or look at your MP3 player or look at, you know, whatever it is that's playing,

720
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
you should now see, and if not, I want you to email, you should now see the time at

721
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
36.

722
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
35.

723
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
36.

724
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
37.

725
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Okay.

726
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
That means that the countdown timer is working.

727
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And, oh my gosh.

728
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Stephen Hawking is.

729
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Hello.

730
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Adam.

731
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I wanted to commend you on your use of a biodiesel algorithm appeal.

732
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Your efforts to help the environment with Trinity are much appreciated.

733
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And, I'm sure that will help offset the four miles per gallon of your

734
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
bedding with your gas.

735
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Guzzly, well-selling to Jaguar of shit bucks.

736
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Excuse me.

737
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Jaguar.

738
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Anyway, keep up the good work.

739
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Tailwinds.

740
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Buddy.

741
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Sensei.

742
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Hello, Adam.

743
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
This is Pick from the Pickcast.

744
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I am my podcaster originated from Hong Kong, but right now I'm staying in Canada from

745
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
my study.

746
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:27,000
During my Christmas vacation, I travel back to Hong Kong to visit the new Disneyland.

747
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
On the other hand, I also met with a group of podcaster in Hong Kong.

748
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Pa from the CMM podcast.the idea that we should get the podcaster in Hong Kong to make a song.

749
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So, we did it.

750
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
We transform on a podcast into Chinese version.

751
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And we even make an MV on that.

752
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:58,000
So, if you are the listeners of Daily Sauce Cook, wish to take a look at the music video,

753
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,000
as well as listening to the song, you can check the alpha pause website, which is

754
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
CMM.HK.

755
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Thank you very much, Adam.

756
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
See you.

757
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Yeah, no problem.

758
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
You gotta listen to that.

759
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It happened on a podcast in Chinese.

760
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
It's freaking awesome.

761
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Absolutely.

762
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Warning.

763
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
The following promo and welcome message from Soccer Girl Incorporated is definitely not

764
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
family-says.

765
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Soccer Girl Incorporated.

766
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You're one-stop shop girl.

767
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
You're podcasting.

768
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Fuck me the snooze.

769
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Yeah.

770
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Near the highway by Eleanor's middle school, your protege has been through like 45 interviews.

771
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Your stomach muscles are shredded completely.

772
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Your candy corn candies are no longer appealing.

773
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
You hate all the same.

774
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
You need something crazy.

775
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
More crazy than will to be babies on acid.

776
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
More crazy than people who get long fake nails.

777
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Though they're pretty crazy.

778
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Those nails are dangerous.

779
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Seriously, though, you should come listen to Soccer Girl Incorporated.

780
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
SoccerGirl.podshow.com, which is known official podshow podcast.

781
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Just between you and me.

782
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I don't think they know what they're getting themselves into.

783
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
If you're feeling down and you're running out of drugs.

784
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Just come listen to my show.

785
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And make you feel like you're on me.

786
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
My stomach muscles are completely shredded.

787
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Yeah.

788
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Soccer Girl Incorporated.

789
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
A proud member of the podshow podcast network.

790
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
There are a whole bunch of people who ran out of ban with the Soccer Girl was one of them.

791
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Did her host go down?

792
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I think that's what happened.

793
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I don't know if she ever actually was able to get her files and her posts back.

794
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Which really sucked.

795
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
But she's now assigned up with the network.

796
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And we welcome her.

797
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
No, of course we know we got into Soccer Girl all kinds of crap with you.

798
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And I love it.

799
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I love it.

800
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
You know, I got you.

801
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I got you, baby.

802
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I got mad.

803
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I got dawn.

804
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I have such a harem of women.

805
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I love it.

806
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Of course, if that's not entirely your style.

807
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
You could also check out Heather and John L.

808
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Accuview are underwriting the entire podcast at download.accuview.com.

809
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
They had an interesting guest on.

810
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
It's funny because I read a lot of crap in the forums.

811
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I wonder if people have actually listened to the show.

812
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Now, I didn't listen to the first two episodes.

813
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I caught the third episode.

814
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I have the first one.

815
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Apparently they did a sound seeing tour of a contact lens shop.

816
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Obviously, to satisfy the sponsor and boy, that got a lot of flag.

817
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
But I think they're learning.

818
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And, you know, for all the yelling and shouting that's going on,

819
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I think that we should be really happy about what Accuview actually

820
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Johnson and Johnson is doing.

821
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And listen to the episode number three.

822
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
There is only one mention of the sponsor.

823
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I found a very appropriate time, very appropriate man.

824
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
But they actually had a pretty cool guest on.

825
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
They played some music from the podcast and music network.

826
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
But they're starting to come into their own three episodes.

827
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Give them a chance.

828
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And yes, absolutely.

829
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I don't mind getting paid to talk about that.

830
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Because it's worth it.

831
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Check it out.

832
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
One last audio comment and one last positive music song for you today.

833
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Yeah.

834
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I don't even have a podcast.

835
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Guess what?

836
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I am going to jail because of podcasting.

837
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
That's right, Adam.

838
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And what did I do to deserve this?

839
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Well, it's not that I talked about politics or religion or anything like that.

840
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Apparently, as it turns out,

841
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
you just can't say anything negative about anyone or anything.

842
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
For example, if a company produces a lousy product,

843
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
you can't say that.

844
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Or if someone cheats you or does something wrong or illegal,

845
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
you can't say that.

846
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
You just cannot say anything that's negative in any way whatsoever.

847
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
In my case, I mentioned in one of my recent episodes

848
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
that a one of the local media organizations has started podcasting.

849
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
But I said that they shouldn't call it a podcast because

850
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
what they do is they just take content from their existing media

851
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
and put it on an RSS feed and call that a podcast.

852
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
So, you know, I said, you can't call that a podcast, right?

853
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
So apparently, I can't say that because now they can sue me

854
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
for everything I'm worth and more.

855
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
As if that's not bad enough, it seems that podcasting itself is illegal here.

856
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Any form of communication that can be heard by the public

857
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
must be regulated and licensed by the government.

858
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And Adam, if you think you have problems with ASK at BMI,

859
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
thank whichever God you pray to that you're not in measure.

860
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Because here, these people have the right to shoot you.

861
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
That's right.

862
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
A couple of months ago, a street pedal was shot in the chest

863
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
for selling pirated music and DVDs by the local trade enforcement officers.

864
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
So I just want to point out to you, Adam,

865
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
that I'm not being negative about anything.

866
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I just want you and all the other podcasts in the US and the UK

867
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
to feel so much better tonight, knowing that you can say things like

868
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
f***ing use and sale without going to jail.

869
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
So thanks for everything, Adam.

870
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And I hope you forgive me if I don't hear any more DSTs

871
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
because I don't think they're going to let me download podcasts from jail.

872
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Thanks for listening.

873
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Back to you, Adam.

874
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So I don't know if that was real or spoof

875
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
the bleeps was self-centered.

876
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And so I won't name the place where this audio comment

877
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
apparently came from, but it's a place where if you spit on the ground

878
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
or if you actually can't buy chewing gum there.

879
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
So most of you probably know what country I'm talking about.

880
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I don't feel good, dude.

881
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
That makes me feel really bad, actually.

882
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
It's like it just boggles my mind that there's a government.

883
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And actually in the country you're in,

884
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I think in some ways a progressive government,

885
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
in some ways not obviously,

886
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
that there's a government that can actually create a law

887
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
saying when you talk to the public and at large

888
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
it has to be licensed by the government.

889
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
That's pretty scary stuff.

890
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And you know what?

891
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I think that could definitely spread.

892
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I think that could go, that could spread across other

893
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
democracies, no problem.

894
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
So yeah, so I'm definitely counting my blessings

895
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
and thanking my lucky stars.

896
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
But I do not feel good at all that this is happening to you.

897
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
So if it is true, let me know.

898
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
And let me know if there's something that I can do.

899
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
One last song I was perusing through my playlist

900
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
on the Pod Save Music Network.

901
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I'd added this one a long, long time ago.

902
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I think I've actually played it before.

903
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
It's nice for kind of a great day outside of Curry Cottage

904
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
and Gilford.

905
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
The amphibians and rain came down.

906
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
But yeah, I want to stranger.

907
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
You're maybe selling your soul

908
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
to the devil with a dangerous face.

909
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,000
And don't give your soul to a stranger.

910
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
You call us the same as we're in the deal with the devil

911
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
and tell those names.

912
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:11,000
When it's falling down, it's falling down.

913
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And let me know if there's something I can do.

914
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
It's falling down, it's falling down.

915
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
It's falling down, it's falling down.

916
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:27,000
It's falling down, it's falling down.

917
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
And let me know if there's something I can do.

918
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
So yeah, so I'm definitely counting my blessings

919
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Why sell your dust so cheap?

920
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And revisions in every day, they're got a lot of dust in all this way.

921
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:58,000
To run, run, change your face so neatly.

922
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I think it's on your heart.

923
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I don't wanna say goodbye.

924
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I was the one that went into my eyes.

925
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
When it's broken down, it's all in time.

926
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
It's all in your sight.

927
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
It's all in time, it's all in time.

928
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Just like the sky.

929
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
When it's the sun.

930
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
When it's the sun.

931
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
When I look close, when the sky is falling.

932
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I think it's on your heart.

933
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I think it's on your heart.

934
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
When it's the sun.

935
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
When it's the sun.

936
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
It's the way you go away.

937
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Why do you go away?

938
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Why do you go away?

939
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Why do you go away?

940
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Why do you go away?

941
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Why do you go away?

942
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Don't give your heart too strange at all.

943
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
You're never sorry to me, to be honest, may it stay.

944
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
You'll never be as sure to me, tomorrow.

945
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
What's more than dan months going on.

946
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It's all in time, we're going in prison.

947
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
It's all in time, it's all in time.

948
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
It's all in your sight, it's all in time.

949
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I think it's on your heart.

950
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
You'll never listen to me.

951
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
When I look up to the sky, it's full of air

952
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Where is the sun?

953
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Where is the sun?

954
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
When I look up to the sky, it's full of air

955
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Where is the sun?

956
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Where is the sun?

957
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Where is the sun?

958
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
When I look up at the sky, it's full of air

959
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Where is the sun?

960
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Where is the sun?

961
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:56,560
And Fibience Rain came down from the podcast music network, music.potcho.com.

962
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,560
You know what?

963
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,760
Thank you all so much for listening.

964
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,400
Thanks for all the feedback on the audio, on the levels.

965
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,360
I'm running a little bit hotter today, running the sound a little bit hotter just to

966
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,040
see if that, if that coincides with everybody.

967
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,080
So you're not being blasted away by other stuff being played on your computer because

968
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,040
you can have to crank the volume up so loud.

969
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:20,880
I'm actually considering some day this week to do a complete reconfigure of the stereo

970
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,360
valve processor.

971
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,440
I think that that's really where a lot of these problems should be solved, certainly

972
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,800
in the home setup, so some mucking around is an order.

973
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:36,240
Hey, dailysourceco.com is where you can find the latest podcast and of course the podcast

974
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,240
feed.

975
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,800
Curried.com for general stuff and of course your feedback through adamaccurried.com.

976
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,640
I'll be here tomorrow for the Tuesday's edition of Delta.

977
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,840
Sierra Charlie.
