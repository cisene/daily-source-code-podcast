00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 3-1-6

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped my ass

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jar

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm guessing it's Adam Curry

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Come on you once again from Sunday Northern California

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hey everybody, it is your daily source code my name is

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Adam Curry

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
At least it's probably Monday where you are

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's Sunday still here in

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The Curry Condo

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In San Francisco

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We're bringing you some pot safe tunes

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We're gonna out of town in a small cafe

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
She had the motion of the ocean out her

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It was this way she had

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Everybody looking back and everybody took him back

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And anything she wanted all the guys all day

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I was fine for so few things

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I know

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Too funny because she knows she got it

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
She got it and she got it

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The moves I'm trying to get into

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Don't make a man we're worried

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Still like everything is okay

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
She got it

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Pauice

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And I think I wanna give you this bag

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Pauice

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And every moment's I'll be on a bus

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And say, it's my Pauice

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And I think I wanna give you this bag

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And I think I wanna give you this bag

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Pauice

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And every moment's I'll be on a bus

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
She holds you down but when you need a push

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
She'll keep it on and she reflects

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That she forces her look

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
She got everything and you got everything

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You dream about everything's in a small

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
She's still your heart like it for now

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
She got it

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Exactly what you want when

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
She holds you in a message just to see you get it

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
She got it

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But then now I'll say if she was there for a GV

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And a life of both this press and one was totally gone

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Pauice

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And I think I wanna give you this bag

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Pauice

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And every moment's I'll be on a bus

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And say, it's my Pauice

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And I think I wanna give you this bag

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Pauice

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And every moment's I'll be on a bus

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And every moment's I'll be on a bus

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
She'll keep this bag

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,960
Or 정말 you give us this

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Fizz and Airbnb

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
See her guess

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Wanna see just how deep work is

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Guess what's in a magical secretplis she is

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll pay with my corporate

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I just want to travel inside and see her

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
economic deep soul

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
fresh from the West Coast

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,740
She got everything

68
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,000
It work is But ready to web she don't live

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't care how people slow to be

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh she's so friendly Hello Jack

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Sam drills into masterfight

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Keepin' a breath when like heatin' it has been hot

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Take a great chick, she's the medicine

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
She got tricks and she got some treats

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
She's like the ground on the meat

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You knock it off your feet, she digs

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Everything about it for my head

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't know if I'm a goose or never,

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Knees and sells a music way, she speaks now

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
She speaks now, she speaks now

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Consisting with an energy sense

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
She's like the middle games when it's time to play

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
She's like a farmer, it's not for watching

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Just a whiff or a whiff or a memo

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Make it me, skip me, skip me

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Owls!

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Do you think I'll do it like you

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
There's nothing I can help you

89
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Owls!

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Do you think I'll do it like I said

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Owls!

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm about to make music that work

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Black delicious

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And it's...

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Owls!

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You got to run my epitaph right, there's actually

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Owls!

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Certainly can't think so much

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'll have to get some official words

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
J-Mac from Hood High

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Owls!

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The craft!

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Nice ending, a little surprise there

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I hope you are ready for another week

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
of hitting the daily grind

107
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Hope you had a great weekend

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I was all by myself

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Of course it's a Martin Luther King day

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So you may actually

111
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Be chilling back, relaxing and not doing anything

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
An amazing amount of companies are not really honoring this holiday

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Or not really I guess by making compulsory to come to work

114
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Same as not honoring

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I thought it was a national holiday

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It was like a obligatory, it could be wrong

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I had a great weekend

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Which really started off Friday night

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
At the Pod Show HQ

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We had some visitors

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
A couple podcasters show up

122
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And this was actually all

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
All pre-arranged

124
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Chef Mark, who has the Chef Mark podcast

125
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Came by and cooked paella

126
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
For the entire office

127
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He made so much and came in with the whole paella

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Pan and his own gas set up

129
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And just it was a wonderful smell in the office

130
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But he made so much that we had to invite

131
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The four neighboring offices just

132
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And they even took stuff home in

133
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Topwear and all kinds of other containers

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
To have so much of it

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It was just fantastic

136
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It was so good, I'm not a big paella

137
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You're a fan actually

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But it was really good, it was chicken

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And of course the yellow rice

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Which was not soggy

141
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You know, it wasn't that milky, crappy stuff

142
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It was just it was nice

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And lobster tails and mussels

144
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And oh man, it was so nice

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Also met

146
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Emily and Elizabeth from sex with Emily

147
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The podcast sex with Emily

148
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm not quite sure what the connection was

149
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
How they came along with Chef Mark

150
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But basically Chef Mark and whole bunch of women walked in

151
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It was very cool

152
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And it was really nice

153
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It was nice meeting the neighbors as well

154
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And hanging out and Jady from Mad Pod was there

155
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
He was hanging out as well

156
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Of course lots of folks were in town

157
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
For Mac world

158
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Speaking of Macs

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I've been bitching about this sound problem

160
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Which you may hear in this podcast

161
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
All of a sudden you know

162
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You may just hear this skipping or digital audio

163
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Hang

164
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And I have here a web page

165
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It is

166
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Here we go

167
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Powerbook G4 double layer SD

168
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Audio stutters or skips

169
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Check this out

170
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
When you're running two or more audio applications

171
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
In your Powerbook G4 15 inch double layer SD

172
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Your Powerbook G4 17 inch double layer SD

173
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Whatever the hell that is

174
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The audio may intermittently stutter echo or skip backwards

175
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This can happen even if one audio application isn't playing

176
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Or you have the sound muted in the application

177
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Such as when playing a game

178
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
This can involve any application that uses audio

179
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So just quick time items

180
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
IDVD and many third

181
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Party applications like games and audio applications

182
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
To avoid this

183
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
No way

184
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
First of all

185
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Here's recognition of the problem

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm very happy to see this

187
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh yeah, sound day night

188
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You know what I'm doing

189
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So that's pretty cool

190
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Because the first thing you got to do

191
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Is true

192
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Something's wrong, something's up

193
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
About that

194
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Now

195
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It goes on one last paragraph

196
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
To avoid this

197
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Run only one audio application at a time

198
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If it looks like you have

199
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
One audio application running

200
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But the sound is still skipping or

201
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Stuttering check for hidden

202
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Login items or startup items

203
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay, obviously

204
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's not a fix

205
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That's a workaround and a sad one at that

206
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I have

207
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Maybe see I currently have

208
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Megaseg open

209
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I have audio hijack pro running

210
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm going to quit iTunes

211
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And maybe that'll make a difference

212
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It does say I must add

213
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This document will be updated

214
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
More information becomes available

215
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay, so looking forward to that

216
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Got that one bookmark

217
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And of course the link to that page

218
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We'll show up in today's show notes

219
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So Melta was pretty cool

220
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
We have this Russian scientist from Canada

221
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's pretty interesting

222
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He had called called or called emailed

223
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Ray Lane

224
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
One of our investors

225
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And he had such a wrap on him

226
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That Ray who was totally a guy

227
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Who sniffs out bullshit

228
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And just doesn't

229
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Have much leniency for anything other than

230
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Good stuff

231
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Pass this on to us and say, I don't know

232
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You guys should check him out

233
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Maybe something there

234
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I got a feeling that there's something going on with this guy

235
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Wow

236
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It was fun

237
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
He came down for a couple days

238
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And we talked about

239
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
How man just the aspects of scalability

240
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
To what social networking

241
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Is can be

242
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It was just really really nice

243
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
To have someone extremely smart

244
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Hang it out at the office

245
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Oh shit

246
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm burning down my power book

247
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That will definitely

248
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Cause audio skipping if I torch it

249
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
To anyone who said that was cool

250
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Just shout out to him because I know he's listening

251
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And I know he's listening because Matt he was able to recite a lot of stuff

252
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Going on with the source code

253
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But it was kind of cool you told me a story about

254
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
He's all about usability and interfaces

255
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And told me the story about how in

256
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I guess it was World War 2

257
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
There were so many

258
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Gear up landings

259
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And upon interviewing all the pilots

260
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It turned out that

261
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Especially in the dark

262
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The concept of a handle to pull down the gear

263
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Or a handle to push down the flaps

264
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It was just too much confusion in the cockpit

265
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And that's how they actually came up with a design

266
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
If you look at any

267
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Certainly single-engine aircraft

268
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You'll see that the flaps lever

269
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Kind of resembles a flap

270
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's a flat button that you push down to

271
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
To make the flaps go down

272
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And the

273
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The lever to

274
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Extend to retract the landing gear

275
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Is actually a rubber round wheel

276
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Resembling your wheels

277
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And I was kind of cool

278
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And more I thought about it

279
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
There's something to that usability stuff

280
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Hey lots of audio comments for today's show

281
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Hi Adam

282
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
This is Scott Allsmith from the road

283
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No second why is that

284
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Why is that showing up only in one channel

285
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What sucks?

286
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Hold on, you must be able to do something about that

287
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I have the

288
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Can I punch that mono somehow

289
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
To

290
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Shoot

291
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay, well

292
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
If I only do one channel you're going to hate it

293
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
That sucks here and stuff and only one one year

294
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I

295
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't think I can monoize this with what I'm doing

296
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Let me check

297
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I do anything with

298
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Audio hijack pro

299
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
No, I don't think so

300
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't think so

301
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Let's see maybe I can make

302
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Megaseg output mono

303
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That'll be cool

304
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Playback

305
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'll put

306
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Shoot

307
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Ah screw it

308
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Okay

309
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Listen on one channel then

310
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Less travel the podcast

311
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That would be the podcast that you've never listened to

312
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Until now at least

313
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Anyway, I hear that you have a little problem with

314
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Jetlight

315
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Don't worry, my friend, it happens to all of us

316
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And the road less traveled podcast

317
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Just got to stop

318
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I got to figure out how to make that

319
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That's got to be stereo

320
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's got to be two channels

321
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I just can't I can't handle it. I'm so sorry

322
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It was actually very cool because it's about

323
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
An anti jet lag diet

324
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But there's just no way

325
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
No way and hell we can listen to that

326
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
For like two and a half minutes

327
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Hi Adam, this is Jordan Taylor from Rhythm Angels

328
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Rock and Blast cast over in Vancouver

329
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Washington

330
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I just got finished listening to Delta Sierra

331
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Charlie 315 and while listening to it

332
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I encountered a pretty serious problem

333
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Man, I was just in kitchen

334
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Mind my own business

335
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
While I was making a little bit of dinner

336
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Had the MP3 player on

337
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Taken in what you were saying

338
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And then came the Trinity segment

339
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
All of a sudden

340
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm dancing like a fool through on flower rounds

341
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Oh man, this is not

342
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
He's really funny

343
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
She was walking her little dog and saw me bust and move

344
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Needless to say

345
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm now addicted to the Trinity jingle

346
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
All right, I can't get that thing out of my head

347
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So thanks Adam

348
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Thank you for getting that little ditty stuck in my head

349
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
for the next week

350
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And now I gotta go explain to my neighbor

351
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
That I was not on drugs

352
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Like she'll really believe that

353
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I love the show

354
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I can not go day without checking for another download of it

355
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm going to go not for you

356
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And my boyfriend who pointed me towards your show

357
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
To introduce me a podcasting

358
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I would not be doing my own podcast

359
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So you can check that out if you have a little time too

360
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Wrathamangel.lipsen.com

361
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'll get you there

362
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Talk at you later

363
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Tailwinds my friend

364
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Tailwinds back at you

365
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't know everything froze up for a second there

366
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm just going to ignore it

367
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Just like it didn't happen

368
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So you like that

369
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You're into the Trinity tune

370
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Okay

371
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Kick off your shoes girl

372
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That's right

373
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Now if you're wearing a sweater or something

374
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Take that off

375
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That's right

376
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I just want to whatever t-shirt you have on right

377
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Okay

378
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That's good

379
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You can participate in this at home as well

380
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So you're on your sock

381
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
May bare feet is even better

382
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I think

383
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah

384
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Okay

385
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You ready?

386
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's even better if you have bare feet

387
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Tight feeling pants and a tank top

388
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Okay

389
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Maybe you should go

390
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Maybe you should put it on pause

391
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And go and dress like that

392
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And then come back

393
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah

394
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Okay

395
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You back

396
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
All right

397
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Here we go

398
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Woo

399
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It is time once again to talk about

400
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
That piece of biodiesel

401
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Her name is Trinity

402
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Trinity

403
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Trinity

404
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The quintessential luxury

405
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Oh

406
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Trinity

407
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Trinity

408
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
From the biodiesel

409
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Industry

410
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah

411
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Well

412
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I kind of tell you

413
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Today I had quite a trip with Trinity

414
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That would be today being Sunday

415
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I planned out a whole trip

416
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And isn't it just amazing how you can actually survive

417
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
With a cell phone

418
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Actually let's just say a blackberry

419
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Because I don't know if you could survive with only a cell phone

420
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But the blackberry

421
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Which has a Gmail local on it

422
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So I can find literally any address anything I want

423
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And even get street maps if I want

424
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And a GPS

425
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So off I went with armed with

426
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
All I needed

427
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
My blackberry

428
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
My Tom Tom

429
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Portable GPS

430
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And I pre-programmed a nice little route

431
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Which you can do with this Tom Tom go

432
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
First stop

433
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Was

434
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Ikea

435
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
In Emoryville

436
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
My goodness

437
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
This place is amazing

438
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And you know what you just can't walk through Ikea

439
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Without putting shit in your car

440
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
The absolutely don't need

441
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
They've got such a wonderful format of path

442
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You know it

443
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Before you know it

444
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I was just coming for a table

445
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Which by the way

446
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I wasn't able to find

447
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Nor was able to find that the Shandelier I was looking for

448
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Like great reading land

449
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But I can do

450
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I got

451
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Cooking utensils

452
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Which I'm sure I'll never use

453
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh very important I got six glass

454
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Ashtrays

455
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So I don't have to carry the

456
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Outto its box around with me

457
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Dropping ashtrays everywhere

458
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But she performed wonderfully

459
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It was great

460
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I had the roof slid open

461
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Across the Bay Bridge

462
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It was just fantastic

463
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I got a

464
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Finally got a fuel for her power

465
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
For the pickup

466
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Which of course is

467
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Not all that much

468
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
But as you're driving along

469
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Once you get up to speed

470
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You can really smell

471
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Kind of the lovely

472
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Fumes

473
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Wafting around you

474
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Particularly with the roof open

475
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It was really enjoyable

476
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Beautiful day for it too

477
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And after that I went for a quick stop

478
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
That I wanted to go to Berkeley

479
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The bio fuel oasis

480
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Unfortunately as I rolled up

481
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
In front of the egg

482
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Look I got that

483
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh there we go

484
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I guess I had too many audio applications open

485
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Uh, apple

486
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Okay

487
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Rolled up to what

488
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I don't have to be called

489
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Garage really

490
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And kind of like the

491
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Garagey industrial district

492
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
A cute sign

493
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That said

494
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
They were open every day

495
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Monday to Thursday

496
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
From 4 to 8 p.m

497
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Friday's by special appointment

498
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Open Saturday until 5 p.m.

499
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And they're not open on Sundays

500
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So I'll just have to go back

501
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But I didn't have my recording gear there

502
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But there was just no one to talk to

503
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So that will obviously remain on the agenda

504
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
To visit the bio fuel

505
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The Berkeley bio fuel oasis

506
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
On a Trinity trip

507
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Let me just see this one

508
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
One of the common I got here from

509
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Matt Snoggrass

510
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Adam while listening to

511
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
DSC 312

512
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
One

513
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You should have taken a digital picture

514
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Of Trinity

515
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Not parked over the line

516
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And the other car that was parked over the line

517
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Fight the power

518
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
He says

519
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yeah

520
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Actually I did go to my guy Mario

521
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And I said hey who hands out the

522
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Citation's here

523
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
He says we do

524
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Said dude that was so not you

525
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Who did that right

526
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And he kind of smirk

527
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
He said he knew who it was

528
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
He said don't worry about it

529
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Which means it's being fixed

530
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Two

531
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
When you leave Trinity alone for a while

532
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You really should disconnect the battery cable

533
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Leaving it connected

534
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Drain the battery bit

535
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
After long stays at the

536
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
At the cottage

537
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That could take its toll

538
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Matt Snoggrass from Rosal Park

539
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
New Jersey

540
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Thank you very much Matt

541
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yeah

542
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But kind of

543
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The way she just started up on one go

544
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
When I came back that makes you feel so good

545
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Not having to dive underneath the hood

546
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Let's

547
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Let me see what this is a really long feed back that I got here

548
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
There's a lot of people that are

549
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Responded to the

550
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Babe code

551
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Concept of starting a biodesol

552
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Refinery in the Bay Area

553
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And

554
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I think that the

555
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I have this feeling that the trip to the

556
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Biofuel

557
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Oasis in Berkeley will

558
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Really help us get a much better insight

559
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
As to what kind of businesses

560
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It can be in what it will take

561
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And can you're opening hours

562
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Only be from 4 to 8

563
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Every single day

564
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Stay tuned

565
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Because that will be coming up soon

566
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
In another Trinity

567
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
She could talk

568
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You didn't think

569
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I don't for booping in her tank

570
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
We're Trinity

571
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I am Trinity

572
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yeah

573
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Hey, I got invited to the London Air Show

574
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Cool is that

575
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
From the PR agency

576
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Taking place in Earl's court

577
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
From 21st to 23rd of April

578
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I guess that is so it's not in the airport

579
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Then then

580
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
How do they do that?

581
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Are they going to have any flying demonstrations?

582
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Sure, I hope so

583
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Well anyway

584
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm just seeing this as Earl's court

585
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That doesn't make sense

586
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
There's no place to fly any Earl's court

587
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Is there?

588
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Well, no wonder he hasn't responded

589
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
To my request if I could fly in

590
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
There's nothing cooler than flying in

591
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
To an air show

592
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
That is so awesome

593
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Judy Engelsberg sent me an email

594
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Which is representative of quite a lot of listeners

595
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
To the show

596
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
This is my 34th time that my subscription

597
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
To your show has stopped through iTunes

598
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I've been listening for over a year

599
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And I switched over iTunes from iPod or Lemon

600
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Because I like iTunes features

601
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
But I have had to re-subscribe to your show

602
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And I don't know why

603
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I know it's easy to do

604
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I just drag the RSS tag in iTunes window

605
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Which I learned from you

606
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Just wanted to let you know

607
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Because you mentioned it once on the show

608
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Are you doing it on purpose

609
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
To raise your iTunes podcast ratings?

610
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That's pretty funny, Judy

611
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
First of all, no, I'm not doing anything to break it

612
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But there is a feature in iTunes

613
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Which initially I thought was going to be a really good idea

614
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But has turned out to be extremely broken

615
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
The feature in iTunes

616
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Is that it stops downloading podcasts

617
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It doesn't unsubscribe

618
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But it stops downloading podcasts

619
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
If you have not listened to five episodes in a row

620
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And I'm seeing that

621
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm subscribed to this evolutionary vlog

622
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Whatever it is

623
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And it's a community

624
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The video podcast site

625
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Excuse me

626
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Sense out

627
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm actually drinking to T right now

628
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Oh, I was looking for a Sense out machine for the condo

629
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Couldn't find one

630
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'll have to make another Trinity road trip for that

631
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Anyway

632
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So there's probably more than

633
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Sometimes 10 videos a day come down the pipeline on that

634
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And so it stops after five

635
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And actually it will give a little

636
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Exclamation mark next to the podcast

637
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And then you can say, hey

638
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Oh, it'll actually ask you

639
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You have not listened to this podcast

640
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
No, I'll do you want to continue downloading or not

641
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But I think it stops downloading

642
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And it won't download the episode

643
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You've missed you have to do that manually

644
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Now, initially I thought that was a pretty good idea

645
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Because

646
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Well, you don't want people who were subscribed to stuff

647
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Just to stay subscribed forever

648
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
But now that we're seeing

649
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Different usage of these RSS feeds

650
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I think that that should be

651
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Probably be by default

652
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That should be off

653
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And it should be a preference setting

654
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And that is probably what you're seeing

655
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Judy

656
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Maybe you listen to it from the web or something like that

657
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Or a different location

658
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Or you know

659
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It probably just happened

660
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And I do five shows a week

661
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So if you don't feel like listening for a week

662
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Then that's a shame

663
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Because you won't get any new episodes

664
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
The next time you want to check in

665
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And the question about

666
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
If I'm doing that on purpose

667
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
To raise my iTunes podcast ratings

668
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Pretty funny because, you know, people

669
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Lots of people ask me

670
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You know, how is that top 10 or top 100

671
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Organized and iTunes and from what I understand

672
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It is

673
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Compiled by

674
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
A number of new subscriptions

675
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Over

676
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I believe a 24 hour period of time

677
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Which keeps the list obviously very fresh

678
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But of course it does indeed keep it open

679
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And pretty prone to

680
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
To trickery like that

681
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
This was kind of funny

682
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
This is a promo

683
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Let me see

684
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
How written in

685
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Kind of like what is it like

686
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
A talent like New Jersey, Thug, Italian, style

687
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Something like that

688
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Yeah, have a listen to promo is pretty funny

689
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Hello, Adam Curry

690
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Curry is like the f**king Indian cuisine

691
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Right over here

692
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I wonder when people listen to Adam f**king pancakes

693
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
If they get the f**king runs

694
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What's with the f**king bleeps right now?

695
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I don't f**king know what to say

696
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Back to what I f**king pissed me off over

697
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
His body ran the holy f**king shit

698
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's out of me

699
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What the f**king?

700
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Adam, we're a little off of a game right now

701
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Cause there's some kind of f**king bleep going on

702
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
What?

703
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Little f**king's out over there

704
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
That's our engineer stuff about you

705
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Recording all of f**king shows

706
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Engineering f**king

707
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
That's every time I say

708
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That's Louis

709
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Every f**king time we're gonna say

710
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
What are those f**king words?

711
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
He's pushing that little f**king red button

712
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah, I'm gonna do a little test

713
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Adam Curry likes to get his f**king f**king f**king

714
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I can't see f**king

715
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I think I'm gonna say

716
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm gonna fix this f**king problem

717
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm gonna f**king know

718
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Hey, Louis

719
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So what you said if you're on your own

720
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'll tell you your room out the way

721
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Adam and they might come over and show some respect

722
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You're my holy and man

723
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Anthony the stupidest of a bitch himself

724
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
If it requires a toilet connection

725
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Confine this requires a tolly dot com

726
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It's QU AZ

So come on over in there

I heard you help a brick day

731
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Yeah

732
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Yeah

733
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Go f**k yourself

734
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Listen to her

That was totally the only I changed music store

736
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000

Hey Adam, my name is Ken

753
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I've been listening for something like nine or ten months

754
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You really got me inspired

755
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And I hooked up with a guy that was wanting to do a radio show

756
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But radio is like 400 bucks an hour or something like that

757
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
So I was like hey why don't we do a podcast

758
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
He agreed we tried it out

759
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And we've been doing it ever since

760
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It's a parrottox.com

761
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
P-A-W-R-O-T-A-L-K-S.com

762
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Anyway

763
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Ever since I've been listening to you

764
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I've been thinking about this hundred million listener

765
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
March thing that you've been talking about

766
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And I've been wondering how we're going to get this to come about

767
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Well I think I've made it discovery

768
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And here's what happened

769
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I told my brother and law about our show that we were starting

770
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And he listened to it and he liked it

771
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And he wanted to tell other people about it

772
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
So I said we'll hold it a second

773
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Dude let me make some instructions

774
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And you can email that to people

775
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And then maybe they'll understand what we're doing

776
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
So he did and almost all of those people

777
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
At least tried out the show and I think about half of them

778
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Stuck around and they're still listening

779
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Which is totally awesome

780
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So here's what I did

781
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I went ahead and kind of I type set a document

782
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I'm calling it

783
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It's a PDF file on our website called podcasting 101

784
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Basically it'll teach any person who's never even heard a podcasting

785
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
What podcasting is how to listen

786
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And how to manage your files and whatnot

787
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I had total newbies proof this file

788
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I had them dissected

789
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I had them try it after it was over

790
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I said you know hey you feel like you can do this

791
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And they said oh yeah we can do it

792
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So I'm pretty confident it's going to work

793
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Basically if you go to a pair of talks.com

794
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Go to the podcasting page

795
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I have a print resolution PDF

796
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
As well as a screen resolution PDF

797
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And I put them up on libson

798
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So there's no bandwidth issues

799
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
If you want to link directly to them or whatever

800
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
But I just basically want to offer them up to the podcasting community

801
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Take them email into people, email them to your

802
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Have your listeners email them to their friends

803
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And whatever and get them to subscribe to your podcast

804
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
You know I used paratox.com as the example

805
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
So you know hey if a few people listen to my show too

806
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
That would hurt my feelings

807
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But basically if we're ever going to get anywhere near 100 million listeners

808
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
We're going to have to make those listeners

809
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Not just find them

810
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Hey Adam thanks for inspiring me

811
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Thanks for providing a great show

812
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I honestly really look forward to it

813
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Every time you do it

814
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And hope to your back from me

815
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Thanks so much

816
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Bye

817
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You're very cool

818
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
By the way

819
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Of course the ultimate

820
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
The ultimate goal for the 100 million listeners

821
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
March is to give a whole bunch of

822
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Let's just call them tools to the listeners

823
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So they can really become involved in the show

824
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You know we're seeing stuff like

825
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Wiki show notes

826
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
We're seeing stuff like forums, work very well

827
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
We need plenty other tools

828
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And also let's

829
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I know let's have the listeners have an identity

830
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
All the stuff that's coming with the pod show podcast network

831
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
That is on the way

832
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Yeah hopefully

833
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Hopefully this week

834
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I think some of the

835
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
At least some of the podcasts will start using

836
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Some of the tools of the podcast delivery network

837
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So that'll be coming

838
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I don't feel like talking about that tonight

839
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Let me see

840
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
What did I want to talk about?

841
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
There were some pretty wacky stuff

842
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Yeah a couple of people sent me this

843
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
About

844
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And this is actually from

845
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Where does this come from?

846
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
This is coming from the BBC again

847
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Let me just see if there's a

848
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I'll actually came through boiling boiling

849
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
There you go

850
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Apparently in the UK there's

851
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
We talked about licenses that music stores have to play

852
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Well apparently club DJs

853
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Also if they are actually spitting stuff from their laptop

854
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Or if they've burned stuff or downloaded stuff

855
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
They have to pay an additional 200 pound license fee

856
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
It's crazy

857
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I can't believe it

858
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Oh man

859
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Well make so much sense

860
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
You know when there's only so many

861
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Records you can sell and so many radio stations

862
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
They can play it

863
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Which is of course a defined universe

864
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Then you got to go you got to grow somehow

865
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I guess that's one way

866
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Martin Gordon said that Adam came across this site today

867
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Skyvector.com

868
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Which is like the Google maps of aviation charts

869
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Don't know much about aviation

870
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
But thought I might pass it on to you

871
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
To share it with your fellow flying geeks

872
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Tailwinds

873
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Indeed Martin thank you back at you

874
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Yeah it's very cool

875
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
It's basically you consume in

876
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
You can drag the map and these are really high-res scans

877
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
A lot of love and work it work when into that

878
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Unfortunately there's only a few segments of the US that are currently available

879
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
But it's the typical of an open source project

880
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
That would be so fantastic

881
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
To have a worldwide coverage

882
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Of

883
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Basically all aviation maps

884
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Although I do think there's some

885
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Probably minor copyright violation involved

886
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Hey check this out

887
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Got some really cool news for you

888
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
There's a new breed of terror

889
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
No only as the ancestors

890
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Hi this is Scott Sigler

891
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Author of the podcast novels earth core and ancestor

892
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Over 11,000 people tune in each week to hear ancestor

893
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
A free horror suspense audio book with a gory high-tech edge

894
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And now I am thrilled to announce that I have joined the pod show family

895
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
To get the final two episodes of ancestor

896
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You're going to need to go to Scott Sigler

897
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Dot pod show dot com and get the new feed URL

898
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And pod show will be the exclusive host of my new podcast novel

899
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Infection

900
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Do out the first week of March

901
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm excited to join pod show

902
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It's a cutting edge company that's going to rewrite the rule book of entertainment

903
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
The traditional publishing community can kiss my fat ass

904
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And while you listen to ancestor, keep the ears open for the key phrase

905
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
That sure is fuck ain't no cow

906
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
That'll be decath pods for Scott next time at the office when we serve him some sense say

907
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Dude, very cool to have you on board

908
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
That's very exciting. Scott's always in and out of the office in his motorcycle gear

909
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I don't even know what he rides and I missed a couple other people drop him by the office last week

910
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Because well trucker Tom came by and I really wanted to talk

911
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I don't know what that fuck was doing

912
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Maybe I was doing stuff with a German TV crew

913
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Which, by the way, yes, I was wrong

914
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It is spaitas. Durch of fans in. Not zoot Deutsch is fans in

915
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
So I apologize about that

916
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
But trucker Tom did post pictures of him standing next to

917
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,920
Trinity in the parking lot, which is very, very cool, but I'm sorry, I missed them.

918
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,520
Because I think he probably pulled up with his rig, I mean, so I missed all the vehicular

919
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,280
excitement at the offices past week.

920
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,280
Now, better luck next week.

921
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,280
Hey, what's up, Adam?

922
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
This is Jay Mack.

923
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:18,760
Just checking in, you know, I have a comment regarding a serious satellite, not that I'm not

924
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:26,600
knocking it or knocking a pod show or anything like that, but man, I don't know what it is.

925
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:35,400
But if you listen to, you know, any of the pod show podcasts, series 103, they all sound

926
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,880
like they're at AM, man.

927
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,680
I mean, it's the sound quality in comparison to the actual podcast.

928
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:46,960
And I understand that it's an outlet to, you know, for more exposure, but man, at the same

929
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,760
time, I mean, the sound quality is just man, I don't know.

930
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,520
So I'm just, I'm wondering, you know, what is the reason?

931
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:02,080
Why is the sound quality on your show through the, through the show, so high quality,

932
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:08,800
but at the same time, when it's streamed through a digital satellite service, it comes

933
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,400
through sound like it's through AM.

934
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,920
I mean, it's pretty bad.

935
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:18,400
So I mean, it doesn't do your show or Pacific Coast Highway, or, you know, any of those

936
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,160
very much adjust this as far as the sound of them.

937
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,640
So that's it.

938
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,000
I would like to hear what you had to say about it.

939
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,280
Don't forget, www.hoodard.com.

940
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:34,320
We got an interview with Jiza on the latest, this Jiza Wu Tain clan on our latest episode.

941
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,240
So check that out.

942
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,520
And that's it, man.

943
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,680
Talk to you soon and love the show.

944
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
See.

945
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,560
So they'll subscribe, man.

946
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,920
And actually, I'm stupid.

947
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,880
You probably heard the satellite window beeps of the window closing.

948
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,680
So that actually didn't air on serious.

949
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,080
And of course, that's where they could use this explanation.

950
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,840
So I definitely will have to play this again in the future.

951
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,680
Okay.

952
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:04,680
So just like any other digital transmission, there are bandwidth issues in play.

953
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:10,640
And interestingly enough, this also goes for satellite bandwidth because the satellites

954
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,760
both serious and XM are licensed through the FCC.

955
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,640
And they have allocated an amount of spectrum.

956
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,040
A double shot of sensor.

957
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:30,240
So they've allocated a certain amount of spectrum, frequency spectrum,

958
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,960
to each of the two satellite providers in the US.

959
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,240
And that represents, and I'm not, you know, I don't know all the calculations,

960
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,360
but that represents an actual number of bits and bytes they can pump through that

961
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,400
piece of spectrum.

962
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,520
You know, that's why you only have X amount of channels on your on the television band.

963
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,280
Same goes for the FM band.

964
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,560
This is how much has been allocated is chopped up in this case into two pieces.

965
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,920
And that's it.

966
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:01,440
So now in order to cram all those wonderful channels in there, they have to make some choices.

967
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:08,080
Because you can imagine that high quality digital data takes a more bandwidth

968
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:14,800
than low quality, just like it does, where a file is bigger if it's high quality than a file

969
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,000
for an MP3, for instance, that is recorded a lower quality.

970
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:25,360
So the trick they do is, first of all, all talk stations are mono.

971
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,720
So you know, because that's literally half the signal right there.

972
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,720
And then because talk is predominantly so talky.

973
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:39,680
They, they bring down the quality to almost an AM sounding frequency.

974
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:44,000
And of course, once you pump music through there, and let's be honest, MP3's is not

975
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,200
great source material.

976
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,800
We actually transcode every single show into MP2, and then there's another special,

977
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,560
as actually a special codec, I'm sorry, we transcode them to way files first.

978
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:02,560
And then from way we transcode them to the special MP2 format, which is what the satellite will eat.

979
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,480
And we actually, we look at this in the beginning, and it really doesn't matter.

980
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,840
It's just unfortunate that all we have is a mono talk channel.

981
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:17,440
And most of what is playing on that channel is mono, or is like, you know, cousin Bruce is on

982
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,560
there as well, so I guess he's kind of intended to sound like AM.

983
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,520
Oh, there you have it.

984
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:41,600
Okay, well, two things, first in admission.

985
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:50,240
I have been watching the National figure skating championships, and I have to admit I've been enjoying it.

986
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,880
Of course, this is the corner where us guys get together and talk about all those things

987
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,640
that we probably wouldn't talk about in public, not even at the water cooler, certainly not the

988
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,120
lockers, so I admit it, I like and I hate the new scoring system though, it sucks.

989
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:09,840
You know, I just want the 5, 7, 5, 8, 5, 9, 9, 9, but all this different stuff, I'm very disappointed by them.

990
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,760
But yes, and Scott Hamilton is a dog. He irritates me.

991
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,360
Have you been watching? Let us know. Let me see now.

992
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,920
And audio feedback from a member of the female gender.

993
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,680
Hi, this is Jenny B, and I have a request for your next metro session moment.

994
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,680
I know you do a lot of bits of that shaving, but I was hoping you could do one on how

995
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:39,360
guys can get that sexy stubble look, because I think I speak for a lot of girls when I say that is hot.

996
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,800
So I love you, show, and hopefully I'll see you down in the next one.

997
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:50,400
Alright, thank you. Well, first of all, I'm still using my original marketing quality

998
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:59,440
blade on the M3 power razor. And I got to say the trick for me in making this thing really work is

999
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,480
short strokes. So not long strokes, but short strokes.

1000
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,120
And the way to get stubble is just not the shave for one day. It's the way I always do it.

1001
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:15,120
You know, it's all about the timing. That's really it. It's the timing of when you're going to shave

1002
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,880
and what you're going to be doing and how you want to be. I want to look and how you want to be

1003
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,760
represented. Sometimes I shave at night so that I have that stubble during the day,

1004
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,200
but that's only when some really important is going down.

1005
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,000
And Patricia does not like me with stubble, let me tell you. She hates it.

1006
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:42,720
I mean, she won't let me even kiss her. So that's interesting.

1007
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,400
So how many women out there do like the stubble? Let me know, stubble or no stubble.

1008
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,160
And in what circumstances is stubble better than others? That's an example.

1009
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,960
That's it for our Metro sexual moment for this week.

1010
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,360
Okay, what's going to keep going? I haven't been a pretty good time here.

1011
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:15,040
Mark Smith, I heard you're crazy. Urban do-st ideas in Delta Sierra Charlie 312 about the

1012
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,200
possibilities for linking up audio video pictures and time codes to create as you put it some

1013
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,840
matrix shit. And I thought I should point you to the in the direction of this IT conversations

1014
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:32,080
podcast called particularly pen-up. Man, it's a big word for the for the podcast or participatory

1015
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:39,440
pen-opticon. I think that's it. participatory pen-opticon by gemis, kais, oh man, this is not my

1016
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:48,880
day. Gemi, kaisio, it's a mouthful in hook hitting. But it's so what you were talking about and you're

1017
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,800
like this. It predicts the ends of secrets. Cool. And now that I'm reading this, I'm realizing that I

1018
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:01,920
have not listened to it. I apologize. Shoot. Okay, I'm definitely going to listen to that.

1019
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:09,040
Participatory pen-opticon. I think that's what it is. So this was the idea that you have all this

1020
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,240
stuff stored by time code. And you would have some kind of Tom Cruise like interface. You know,

1021
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,560
one of his futuristic movies where you can grab stuff and just say, okay, show me all the pictures

1022
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:25,520
that took place at this very moment on September 11, 2001 as an example. So that probably,

1023
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,800
oh, that's why I came up with it right from those from those new 9-11 videos that have come out.

1024
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:40,480
Let's see. Well, shoot. Okay. Well, that's basically all I had. One is, no, I don't think so.

1025
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:47,520
Okay, that's it. Still trying to get the the strategy gas together. This would have been a perfect

1026
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,120
weekend. But Ron realized that it was one year since his father passed and in Jewish tradition,

1027
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,160
the family gets back together. And I think they uncover the headstone and eat eggs.

1028
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:06,880
And obviously, there's a lot more behind all that. And I'd love to be educated about it. So that's

1029
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,480
there's a perfect audio comment if you think it was sending one in. And let's wind it up with something

1030
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:19,680
nice from the podcast music network. Shall we? This is our go out, Pinden. Oh, yeah. It's kind of like a

1031
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,480
hip hop of the local hunting marlin off the coast of Miami.

1032
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,840
Bring bonnie and like I get the sodas, baby. For don't we have to get it lifted in back.

1033
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,600
Fillin like a million bucks, large man fat, Grace Lack's greased up, nice light,

1034
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:44,160
black veterans hooked into my sauce, like meckers. Bargaining in sauce that they match and be

1035
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,880
both. I must have colored suspenders, see the images so far. I'm a nice guy with a little money

1036
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,720
to spend. And I'm an advertising girlfriend sent to just me. Is that what you come through? Look at

1037
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,800
your people like what you can do. Come full, rip into my check it like one. So is the

1038
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,360
weapon no women like when you've come full. Missed control without toe, that's so new. Don't give me

1039
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,600
your attitude. Your toddler could get it to. I stay back and smack and hoes and job in a few

1040
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:10,640
good. I be this low. You should assume I'm a 90 pound board. I've been pimples in my room with my computer

1041
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,800
from last every hour of the night. Spucking in a net beat. I'll sound a whining of fire. Can

1042
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:21,360
you in a net wave or sound a whining of fire. Be sweet. Wait, I was only pretty baby. Let the track

1043
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,360
pop. Fillin with them in a video like a back rock. I'm feeling a little so big and we're

1044
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,280
talking about the match. We're all proud. We're all proud. We're all proud. We're all proud. We're all proud.

1045
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,280
We're all proud. We're all proud. We're all proud. We're all proud. We're all proud. We're all proud. We're all proud.

1046
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:42,800
If I had a million dollars, I might do this. By six mid-90s, gas-efficient lifts, the rest I didn't

1047
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,400
invest in sweater vests and socks. And a bunch of bumper stickers for the neighborhood. Why

1048
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,480
tate of ease? You can jog my chrome down west, but the heck of it. Don't whip it to see if you

1049
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,720
didn't want to test it. Get ripped in a moped race, because I'm in it for the money in the

1050
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,800
thrill of the chase. Relaxing on yachts that were bought by rich, drinking soda, pop,

1051
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,560
goblin, thick strips of shit, klinger, like it. So we can read this every your time.

1052
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,240
Treating women like they women, because the feeling is wrong, opening doors, using terms like

1053
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,480
management, managing you, when we complimenting them whenever we can. I like your hands,

1054
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,240
and the dimples on your knuckles hop, and high-five, I smile with sheets, y'all the way.

1055
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,480
So the women in the back can see. You said it's only the wanderer, I think you want to know

1056
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,200
that not a girl hot, if a lover rock, I'll be back and I'll knock your guns.

1057
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,880
Wait, I was only playing baby, nothing track. If you don't admit them did it,

1058
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,080
I mean you like a backdrop. I'm feeling no snow, make me rip up the match,

1059
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:35,200
sweat, or a gal pimping, or a gal pimping, or a gal pimping. All smiles in and a lift,

1060
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,280
it get dodge ran, back in the women like you are, teacher, making that you're making me crazy.

1061
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,680
You ask me to make you think you're making me crazy. You're making me crazy.

1062
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,920
So the women in the back can see. You said it's only the wanderer, I think you want to know

1063
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,560
the money. You're hot, if a lover rock, I'll be back and knock your guns.

1064
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,880
You've got a job and hell, come and let me dispel me. You've been a dang well in the

1065
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:00,080
wash them and leave me when I say that. I meet a great MC, shake his hand and tell him to say glad.

1066
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:05,600
Oh bad, why did we call the mix of today? I only take you when MC with me to take no comparisons.

1067
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,920
You might find me American G.I. and you might keep me with a fly, why?

1068
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,760
Can I try more? Can you in a blind, white, the bottle of the first league over? Can you keep

1069
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,080
cool and cool sides with Marilyn all day? This evening, I'm attending a Kennedy Swarray,

1070
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:22,560
like a nerd, a rabbit, you were burned, it's slated rug. Give me your shitting and let me see your jitter rug.

1071
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:27,120
You are burned, it's slated rug. You please get hit me and let me see your jitter rug.

1072
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:31,520
You're with me to take no comparisons, you can keep me with that. You can keep with this, you can keep with that.

1073
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:38,000
You could keep with this, you could keep with that. You might think you're skimmed or we don't give up!

1074
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,520
You could keep with that, you could keep with this, you can keep with that. You can keep with that!

1075
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,520
I'll pick you up in six, let's go, that is it

1076
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,520
You're trying to catch a glimpse of this day, that is it

1077
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,520
I'll knock you up in so fresh, that's it

1078
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:03,520
I'll pick you up in six, let's go, that is it

1079
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,520
One really has to wonder what Argal Pimpin is, you know

1080
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:24,520
Such a nice mellow vibe for the late Sunday here at the condo

1081
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,520
Totally fits with my new IKEA candles

1082
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,520
Nice lighting, but able to create with my corner lamp

1083
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,520
Oh shit, I was so into that and it ended

1084
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:40,520
Argal Pimpin, you can find on the Podsake Music Network

1085
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:45,520
Work it is by the Argal Pimpin music.podshow.com

1086
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,520
And let me see, something was gonna happen Monday

1087
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,520
Monday we were doing a couple of internal demos

1088
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,520
What was happening?

1089
00:44:53,520 --> 00:45:00,520
I believe I'm going to get my purchasing demo

1090
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:04,520
On the Podsake Music Network, that would be very cool

1091
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,520
I actually did want to just tack on one little piece to the Metro sexual moment

1092
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,520
I'm not going to go back and play the jingle

1093
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:17,520
But what I did Saturday is I cleaned up the entire condo

1094
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,520
I was like Freddie Mercury in that clean video

1095
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,520
I'm telling you, it was great

1096
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:27,520
I was sweeping and I was vacuuming and I was mopping the floors

1097
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,520
On my hands and knees cleaning the toilet bolt man

1098
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,520
Guys make a lot of mess on the toilet bolt

1099
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,520
And I'm careful

1100
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,520
I rewire the television so I can use that

1101
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,520
I don't need that transmitter anymore

1102
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,520
So I can use my wireless whenever I want

1103
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,520
Not just when you have to have no internet

1104
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,520
One of the TV is on

1105
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:53,520
I did the laundry, I washed all the sheets, I washed all my clothes

1106
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,520
That I nicely put in my hamper

1107
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,520
I am truly, truly a Metro sexual man

1108
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,520
Thanks for listening, stay subscribed, will you?

1109
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,520
Pod Show

1110
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:08,520
Nothing says loving like Pod Show from the oven
